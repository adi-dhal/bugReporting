For example like this:\n\n```\nMyScene\n   |-- House\n        |-- Porch\n            |-- SpotLight\n            |-- PorchDoor\n```\n\nWhen loading this simple scene using JMonkey's Blender loader, it will add the SpotLight and its LightNode to \"MyScene\" instead of \"Porch\". So the scene graph will look something like this in JMonkey:\n\n```\nMyScene\n   |-- House\n        |-- Porch\n            |-- PorchDoor\n   |-- LightNode (referencing the SpotLight)\n   |-- SpotLight\n```\n\nThe problem is, that the SpotLight will now affect all of the objects in the scene, and not only the Porch as the artist probably wanted it to.\nThe LightNode which is created for each light in the scene is also attached to the incorrect parent (i.e. the scene's root node).\n\n(Note: The SpotLight is not actually a Node in JMonkey, but is stored inside the lights list of the \"parent\" node.)\n\nI added a fix/patch below that will create a scene graph like this:\n\n```\nMyScene\n   |-- House\n        |-- Porch\n            |-- PorchDoor\n            |-- LightNode (referencing the SpotLight)\n            |-- SpotLight\n```\n\nYou may ask yourself why the LightNode now is added to the same parent as the SpotLight. The reason for this is founded in how JMonkey handles lights.\n\nMy motivations are as follows:\n- When the artist added the light as a child of \"Porch\", she wanted only the children of \"Porch\" to receive lighting from the Spotlight. Thus the light has to be added to \"Porch\". If it was a child of \"LightNode\" it would only affect the LightNode itself and its children. (So nothing in our example.)\n- But: The artist/programmer still expects the LightNode, which was created for the light, to be at the same position as it was in Blender. So if the Porch moved, the light moves with it.\n  Makes sense, right?\n\nDisclaimer: I'm by far no expert on lighting in JMonkey and also have no real knowledge of the source code of the Blender loader. So please thoroughly review may changes in the patch below. And please also make sure that the changes make sense according to my explanation above.\n\nI also want to note that Blender completely ignores the position of the light in the scene graph during rendering. When rendering our example scene in Blender, our Spotlight would affect all of the scene and not just the Porch. (I don't know how Blender's game engine would handle the light.) But this is OK for a renderer that supports radiosity etc. I guess.\n\nHere is the patch:\n\n```\nIndex: BlenderLoader.java\n===================================================================\n--- BlenderLoader.java  (revision 5566)\n+++ BlenderLoader.java  (working copy)\n@@ -242,10 +251,8 @@\n                 Structure objectStructure = pObject.fetchData().get(0);\n\n                 Object object = objectHelper.toObject(objectStructure, blenderContext);\n-                if (object instanceof LightNode) {\n-                    result.addLight(((LightNode) object).getLight());// FIXME: check if this is needed !!!\n-                    result.attachChild((LightNode) object);\n-                } else if (object instanceof Node) {\n+\n+                if (object instanceof Node) {\n                     if (LOGGER.isLoggable(Level.FINE)) {\n                         LOGGER.log(Level.FINE, \"{0}: {1}--> {2}\", new Object[] { ((Node) object).getName(), ((Node) object).getLocalTranslation().toString(), ((Node) object).getParent() == null ? \"null\" : ((Node) object).getParent().getName() });\n                     }\n@@ -253,6 +260,11 @@\n                         result.attachChild((Spatial) object);\n                     }\n                 }\n+\n+                if (object instanceof LightNode) {\n+                    LightNode lightNode = ((LightNode)object);\n+                    lightNode.getParent().addLight(lightNode.getLight());\n+                }\n             }\n         }\n         return result;\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/324/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/323","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/323/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/323/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/323/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/323","id":103795276,"number":323,"title":"Blender loader ignores Custom Properties of the scenes","user":{"login":"slyh80","id":14021830,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/14021830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyh80","html_url":"https://github.com/slyh80","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyh80/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyh80/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyh80/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyh80/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyh80/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyh80/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyh80/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyh80/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyh80/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":692971076,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/labels/BlenderImporter","name":"BlenderImporter","color":"c5def5","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-08-28T21:03:18Z","updated_at":"2017-09-15T02:49:18Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"The Blender file loader (com.jme3.scene.plugins.blender.BlenderLoader) does not store the custom properties set to the scene (in Blender) to the resulting Node object (in JMonkey).\nThe fix is simple.
