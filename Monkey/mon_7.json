But if one of the constructors of the _SpotLight_ class is used that also provide the _spotRange_ parameter, the inverse range value is not set to the correct value. This leads to some lighting effects in the scene, where the default range of _100f_ is used instead of the value set by the constructor.\n\nTo fix this, the internal variable _invSpotRange_ of the _SpotLight_ class has to be set every time, the variable _spotRange_ is set. I whould recommand to simply call _setSpotRange(float)_ from within the constructor.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/562","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/562/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/562/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/562/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/562","id":179919592,"number":562,"title":"Broken Links in Documentation","user":{"login":"vinf100","id":8476521,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8476521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinf100","html_url":"https://github.com/vinf100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinf100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinf100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinf100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinf100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinf100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinf100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinf100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinf100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinf100/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2016-09-28T23:48:00Z","updated_at":"2016-10-28T16:52:45Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"This is not a problem with the engine itself, but with the wiki.

am working in the new 3.1 beta1 release, a clean install, and ran into an Exception while using the visual editor on a clean new gui xml file built using the new file wizard. I have put the exception on pastbin: [](http://pastebin.com/ARRVzJRu)\n\nRecreation is easy:\n1. File -> New File -> GUI -> Empty GUI\n2. Open xml file in editor, then click visual.\n\nThanks,\nTrevor\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/545/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/544","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/544/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/544/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/544/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/544","id":170474820,"number":544,"title":"RotationController for Spatials","user":{"login":"Brainsucker92","id":8946793,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8946793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brainsucker92","html_url":"https://github.com/Brainsucker92","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brainsucker92/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brainsucker92/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brainsucker92/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brainsucker92/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brainsucker92/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brainsucker92/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brainsucker92/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brainsucker92/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brainsucker92/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-08-10T17:36:31Z","updated_at":"2016-08-10T22:59:52Z","closed_at":"2016-08-10T22:59:52Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pulls/544","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/544","diff_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/544.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/544.patch"},"body":"I had several projects in the past where a Class for handling/controlling the rotation of Spatials was quite usefull.
