this PR requires a bit of explanation I think.\nI did **not** use \"throws CloneNotSupportedException\" even though NetBeans suggests it.\nI simply don't since we already consume that exception in Class \"Light\" and we currently have no reason to throw it (XYZLight will always be Clonable)\n\nCasting super.clone(); is valid because Object.clone() will clone the runtime implementation so in DirectionalLight we will really have a DirectionalLight (see http://stackoverflow.com/a/12213417)\n\nThe last thing: I hope it's okay that DirectionalLight.clone() returns a DirectionalLight? This saves us from useless \"instanceof\" and cloning on the user-level since \"covariant returns\" are allowed since Java 5 (returning a subclass of the overriden method's return type)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/415","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/415/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/415/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/415/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/415","id":134253981,"number":415,"title":"Fixes

doSomething());`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/412","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/412/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/412/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/412/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/412","id":133505214,"number":412,"title":"Added

pull request includes a new class called SimpleAppState. It implements a feature that I have felt was lacking in this library since I learned how to use AppStates -- it allows for seamless interaction with all resources that your main class may have through an AppState by providing delegates for SimpleApplication's and Application's methods such as getAssetManager(). It also provides improved lifecycle management such as what is available already in BaseAppState to not force users to choose between the convenient method delegates and BaseAppState's lifecycle management. Lastly, it provides a method to enqueue() a Runnable rather than a Callable to allow those who are implementing games in Java 8 use simple enqueue lambda expressions such as `enqueue(() -> doSomething())` rather than `enqueue(() -> {doSomething(); return null;});`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/412/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/411","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/411/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/411/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/411/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/411","id":133380355,"number":411,"title":"Stack Trace Printed on Server When Kicking Client","user":{"login":"john01dav","id":3982497,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3982497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/john01dav","html_url":"https://github.com/john01dav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john01dav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john01dav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john01dav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john01dav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john01dav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john01dav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john01dav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john01dav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john01dav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-02-13T00:57:12Z","updated_at":"2016-02-13T04:34:49Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Using the following ConnectionListener on the server I get the following error when a client is immediately kicked (I am using this to test that the kicking screen on the client works correctly):\n\n```\nimport com.jme3.network.ConnectionListener;\nimport com.jme3.network.HostedConnection;\nimport com.jme3.network.Server;\n\npublic class ServerConnectionListener implements ConnectionListener{\n    private final ServerNetworkState serverNetworkState;\n\n    public ServerConnectionListener(ServerNetworkState serverNetworkState){\n        this.serverNetworkState = serverNetworkState;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void connectionAdded(Server server, HostedConnection hostedConnection){\n        hostedConnection.close(\"Incorrect Username or Password\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void connectionRemoved(Server server, HostedConnection hostedConnection){\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\n```\nFeb 12, 2016 6:54:32 PM com.jme3.network.base.KernelAdapter reportError\nSEVERE: Unhandled error, endpoint:UdpEndpoint[2, /127.0.0.1:50700], context:Envelope[UdpEndpoint[2, /127.0.0.1:50700], unreliable, 18]\ncom.jme3.network.kernel.KernelException: Endpoint has been closed:java.nio.channels.SocketChannel[connected local=/127.0.0.1:16384 remote=/127.0.0.1:41380]\n    at com.jme3.network.kernel.tcp.NioEndpoint.send(NioEndpoint.java:171)\n    at com.jme3.network.base.DefaultServer$Connection.send(DefaultServer.java:584)\n    at com.jme3.network.base.DefaultServer.registerClient(DefaultServer.java:454)\n    at com.jme3.network.base.KernelAdapter.dispatch(KernelAdapter.java:173)\n    at com.jme3.network.base.KernelAdapter.createAndDispatch(KernelAdapter.java:241)\n    at com.jme3.network.base.KernelAdapter.run(KernelAdapter.java:284)\n```\n\nThe client still gets kicked and the server continues functioning without any apparent error.

Fixing issue 394, when specifying the Serializer class through the @Serializable annotation. The edit took place in  public static SerializerRegistration registerClass( Class<?> cls, boolean failOnMiss ) in Serializer.java\nand now correctly uses reflection to instantiates the Serializer rather than looking up the Serializer for the SerializerClass.\n2. It adds a new feature: I needed to send Savables larger than 32K over a message,the relevant changes are in the send/broadcast methods in DefaultClient and DefaultServer. I also added a new method to their respective interface to configure the buffer size dynamically.\n\nThis also fixes an issue that the SavableSerializer had, the ByteBuffer..Streams did not implement the Output/InputBufferStream contract correctly. This only showed when either of them is wrapped in a Buffered..Stream and buffers larger than 32K are read/written. \n\nIf you decide to discard the >32K buffers feature for DefaultClient/Server, I recommend to use the fixed SavableSerializer anyhow.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/397","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/397/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/397/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/397/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/397","id":124478494,"number":397,"title":"Merge

We then check this boolean and filter out the lights which are not enabled. Having looked at the code there is already a boolean on the light called enabled, however it looks unused and its getter and setter has been commented out. I will bring this back.\n\nThe filtering of disabled lights would then take place in the DefaultLightFilter, at least for now. The downside of this is that a developer might implement their own LightFilter which would mean they would then have to take the `enabled` property into account if they still wanted to filter out disabled lights.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/392","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/392/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/392/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/392/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/392","id":123007849,"number":392,"title":"Fixed a possible bug in TextureAtlas.java","user":{"login":"NemesisMate","id":2411239,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2411239?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemesisMate","html_url":"https://github.com/NemesisMate","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemesisMate/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemesisMate/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemesisMate/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemesisMate/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemesisMate/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemesisMate/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemesisMate/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemesisMate/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemesisMate/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-12-18T19:05:14Z","updated_at":"2015-12-26T20:36:41Z","closed_at":"2015-12-26T20:36:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pulls/392","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/392","diff_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/392.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/392.patch"},"body":"It seems that the variable was the wrong one when adding the normal texture to the atlas.\n\nLink to the post where this is talked: http://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/t/fixed-a-possible-bug-in-textureatlas-java/34653\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4988","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507317096","x-github-request-id":"D742:366E:AE86F:17FDD0:59D7C7B9","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/17960746/issues?state=all&page=13>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/17960746/issues?state=all&page=26>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/17960746/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/17960746/issues?state=all&page=11>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"a1214d46ff72939dcc411fdc8d4499ed\"","status":"200 OK"}}
