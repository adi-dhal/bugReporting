I'm sorry, I didn't discuss this in the forum prior. But I found this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5242533/fast-way-to-find-exponent-of-nearest-superior-power-of-2. It shows a bit performance increase indeed, nothing ground breaking :).\n\nThere is also this, that (i < 1 ? 0) is because FastMath nearestPowerOfTwo() says that nearest is then 0. And the bit version says 1. Which I think is correct. Then it would be something like (int) (i < 1 ? 1 : Math.pow(2, 32 - Integer.numberOfLeadingZeros(i - 1))); to still leave the calculation out on negative numbers.\n\nAnd I tried this (I realize this is not really a valid way to create benchmarks, but):\n\n```\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    int val;\n    long start = System.currentTimeMillis();\n\n//        for (int i = -10000000; i < 10000000; i++) {\n//            int x = FastMath.nearestPowerOfTwo(i);\n//            int y = (int) (i < 1 ? 0 : Math.pow(2, 32 - Integer.numberOfLeadingZeros(i - 1)));\n//            if (x != y) {\n//                throw new RuntimeException(\"Fug\");\n//            }\n//        }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < 100000000; i++) {\n        val = FastMath.nearestPowerOfTwo(i);\n    }\n    System.out.println(\"Fastmath took: \" + (System.currentTimeMillis() - start));\n\n    start = System.currentTimeMillis();\n    for (int i = 0; i < 100000000; i++) {\n        val = (int) (i < 1 ? 0 : Math.pow(2, 32 - Integer.numberOfLeadingZeros(i - 1)));\n    }\n    System.out.println(\"Took: \" + (System.currentTimeMillis() - start));\n\n    start = System.currentTimeMillis();\n    for (int i = 0; i < 100000000; i++) {\n        val = FastMath.nearestPowerOfTwo(i);\n    }\n    System.out.println(\"Fastmath took: \" + (System.currentTimeMillis() - start));\n\n    start = System.currentTimeMillis();\n    for (int i = 0; i < 100000000; i++) {\n        val = (int) (i < 1 ? 0 : Math.pow(2, 32 - Integer.numberOfLeadingZeros(i - 1)));\n    }\n    System.out.println(\"Took: \" + (System.currentTimeMillis() - start));\n\n}\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/347","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/347/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/347/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/347/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/347","id":107724479,"number":347,"title":"Bug in Ray.intersectWherePlanarQuad(V3f, V3f, V3f, V3f)","user":{"login":"slyh80","id":14021830,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/14021830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyh80","html_url":"https://github.com/slyh80","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyh80/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyh80/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyh80/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyh80/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyh80/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyh80/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyh80/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyh80/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyh80/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-09-22T14:19:42Z","updated_at":"2017-09-15T03:24:07Z","closed_at":"2017-09-15T03:24:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"There seems to be a bug in method `Ray.intersectWherePlanarQuad(Vector3f, Vector3f, Vector3f, Vector3f)`, or more precisely in method `Ray.intersects(Vector3f, Vector3f, Vector3f, Vector3f, boolean, boolean)` when called with `true` as value for the second boolean parameter ('quad').\n\nIt seems as if the x-bound is not correctly calculated. When casting a ray the y-values are in the expected range. The x-values however seem to reach positive infinity and intersect with everything right of the quad origin.\n\nExample:\nI'm calling the method like so:\n`ray.intersectWherePlanarQuad(new Vector3f(0, 0, 0), new Vector3f(1, 0, 0), new Vector3f(0, 1, 0), res);`\nThis is basically a quad of size (1|1) with its origin at (0|0). Right? I cast a ray from the current mouse position, using code from the JMonkey forum. The ray is constructed correctly, as it works for other picking tasks.\n\nWhen casting the ray, the resulting y-values range from 0 to 1 as expected. Also only hits are returned when the mouse is inside the expected y-bounds (from 0 to 1 in world coordinates in my example scene).\nThe resulting x-values, however, start at 0 at (0|*) and seemingly go on forever in positive x-direction, without stopping at (1|*) when reaching the right border of the quad. It seems as if there are no bounds in x-direction.\n\nWhen calling `Ray.intersects(Vector3f, Vector3f, Vector3f, Vector3f, boolean, boolean)` and passing in `false` for parameter `quad` it works again. But then only the lower-left triangle is checked for intersections, of course.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/347/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/346","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/346/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/346/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/346/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/346","id":107703721,"number":346,"title":"Eliminates

It makes exceptions when the node has more then 3 children. These lines are new in 3.1\n\n``` javascript\n\nif (children.size() > 4)\n{\n      BoundingVolume bv = this.getWorldBound();\n      if (bv==null) return 0;\n\n      // collideWith without CollisionResults parameter used to avoid allocation when possible\n      if (bv.collideWith(other) == 0) return 0;\n}\n\n```\n\nI attached the corrected Node.java with these faulty lines in commentary. Contact me at ericbourque29@gmail.com if you want a test app that shows the problem. \n\n``` javascript\n\n/*\n * Copyright (c) 2009-2012 jMonkeyEngine\n * All rights reserved.\n *\n * Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\n * modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are\n * met:\n *\n * * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n *   notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n *\n * * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n *   notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n *   documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n *\n * * Neither the name of 'jMonkeyEngine' nor the names of its contributors\n *   may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software\n *   without specific prior written permission.\n *\n * THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS\n * \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED\n * TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n * PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
