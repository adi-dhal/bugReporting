for the issue reported here: https://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/t/ogre-importer-materials-are-not-shared/35663\n\n**Short description of the problem:**\nWe have an Ogre's .scene with two spatials that share the same material. \nWhen this scene is imported in the engine, the two spatials no longer share the material but, instead, they own a new instanced of it.\nThis happens because the SceneLoader loads the objects through the assetManager as if they were unrelated, the assetManager calls _clone(true)_ on the cached models before returning them, this cause the issue.\n\nThis patch loads the models directly with an instance of MeshLoader opportunely extended to have an internal cache that is preserved until the scene is fully loaded.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/476","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/476/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/476/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/476/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/476","id":147483586,"number":476,"title":"Lighting.j3md
