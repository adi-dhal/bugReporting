I wasn't really sure what project to place this in since there is no project for the IDE/SDK, but I think this project best fits. Please feel free to let me know where it should go if not here and I can repost it. \n\n**What did you intend to do, what was the expected outcome?**\nI intended to import a heightmap (the one attached) into JME3. I expected it to work.\n\n**What outcome do you experience instead?**\nIt failed for an unknown reason. However, it does appear to work in other projects in the SDK.\n\n**What steps will reproduce the problem?**\nI imported the attached heightmap into JME3 via the Image Terrain option in the Scene Design view. Once I had entered all of the values into the wizard and told it to begin the process, it appears to begin but then the SDK suddenly closes with the error at the end of this issue post.\n\n**Software Configuration:**\nProduct Version: jMonkeyEngine SDK 3.0\nUpdates: Updates available\nJava: 1.7.0_51; Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 24.51-b03\nRuntime: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 1.7.0_51-b13\nSystem: Linux version 3.19.5-200.fc21.x86_64 running on amd64; UTF-8; en_US (jmonkeyplatform)\nUser directory: /home/<removed>/.jmonkeyplatform/3.0\nCache directory: /home/<removed>/.jmonkeyplatform/3.0/var/cache\n\n**Hardware Configuration:**\nCPU: Amd FX-8350, default clock speed (4GHZ)\nGPU: Nvidia MSI GTX 770\nMotherboard: Gigabyte 990FXA-UD3\nRam: 8GB (total, not allocated, I don't know how much JME3 has)\n\n**Console Output:**\n\n```\nOGL: Throttling update loop.\nEDT: addNotify\nOGL: Enter showing state.\nOGL: Visible.

Bullet:\n\nGenerate a Meshcollisionshape on 64bit Windows 7.\nWrite it out with the native bvh tree.\n\nLoad on same Windows works flawless.\nLoad on linux creates native crashes as apparently the native structure between different OS is not guranteed to be stable.\n\nProposed Solution:\n\nUpon writing the MeshCollisionShape save the os.name and os.architecture properties into the j3o. When loading check if the architecture matches, if not emit warning to Logger and call createShape(true);\nIf the j3o is an older one with no saved os.name default to emit a warning and rebuilding always the shape.\n\nExpected Result:\nIf the j3o does not contain the right native data, the application can continue to work, at an increased loading time for the j3o\n\nAdditional Notes:\nRemoving the native bvh save is in my opinon no options, as it can increase loading time by a factor of roughly 10x while reducing the memory print. This is especially noticeable for large geometries like whole levels. The bullet documentation specifically says to consider saving this native structure.\n\n@normen \nAny objection to this approach?

bug is when two objects exist in the same viewport with two different material schemes fps goes from 60fps to 29fps (for me):\n- Scene has directional light with a shadow map\n- Scene has two objects: 1 object is DiffuseMap and the other is Diffuse (color)\n\nJust copying over from Forum topic: http://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/t/settexture-diffusemap-way-faster-than-setcolor-diffuse/31066/3\n## Test case\n\nSee gist: https://gist.github.com/andychase/be168144ce117c653b5a\n- Needs: Textures/planter.png \n- press \"Z\" and \"X\" to switch on/off\n## Workaround\n\n> In the mean time you can use the DirectionalShadowFilter with a FilterPostProcessor.
