It should be possible, through a general shader API or a\nspecific define, to provide this functionality to any shader willing to use\nit. \nExample:\ngl_FragCoord = APPLY_FOG(color);\n\nwhere APPLY_FOG would be a define that either returns the provided color\n(if fog is disabled) or apply the fogging.\n\n---\n\nHow is this information going to be exposed to an arbitrary shader? \nOne solution is to define UserWorldParameters inside the material which would specify\nwhat kind of user globals the shader can take. The world uniform updater checks which\nare exposed in the system and if there are any matches between the material and\nexposed vars then they are sent as uniforms. \n\nHow will these globals be exposed and what classes are allowed to expose them? \nThe class responsible for assigning these globals to the materials will contain them\nand accept requests from user code to add them to the list. Classes like\nSceneProcessor should be allowed to set them. Singlepass shadow-supporting shaders\nwill accept ug_ShadowMap[] for example, ShadowSceneProcesor generates shadow maps for\nscene and exposes ug_ShadowMap[].\n\nWhat about fog? \nThis is a fixed-pipeline state that is stored inside RenderState. How will the user\nspecify fog? In the Material definition, RenderState ONLY contains whether the\nmaterial should be fogged or not. No other fog-related state is allowed to be set\ninside the material. There must be a way to set the other fog-state through the\nRenderer since it may or may not be using fixed-pipeline. Renderers only supporting\nshaders will set the g_FogParams and g_FogColor depending on the params the user\nspecified. While Renderers only supporting fixed-pipeline will set these parameters\nusing glFog and such and achieve the same result. \nReformulation: Material techniques that use shaders must expose g_FogParams and\ng_FogColor, while Material techniques that do not use shaders must specify Fog Off\ninside the RenderState block to disable fogging for the material.\n\nReference on googlecode:
