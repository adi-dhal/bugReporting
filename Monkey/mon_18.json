This means that shadow maps won’t be calculated for lights that are outside of the frustum. This can give a huge performance boost.\n\nThe shadow disappears when shadow caster geometry is inside light cone which does not reach the camera view frustum but its shadow is casted into the view. It happens very easy. Just make the shadow long enough and move the camera.\nIt is because the light radius (or range) is short enough not to reach the view frustum but the caster is close enough, so the shadow is casted.\n\nProposed fix in this pull request is conservative. It allows to cull shadows less aggressively through new `PointLight` or `SpotLight` setting public method `setShowCulledLightssShadows(boolean)` while default is the old behaviour.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/217","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/217/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/217/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/217/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/217","id":59180158,"number":217,"title":"Fix for incorrect viewport sizes","user":{"login":"nhansen1","id":11186916,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11186916?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhansen1","html_url":"https://github.com/nhansen1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhansen1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhansen1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhansen1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhansen1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhansen1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhansen1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhansen1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhansen1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhansen1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-02-27T02:27:54Z","updated_at":"2015-02-28T03:33:08Z","closed_at":"2015-02-28T03:33:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pulls/217","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/217","diff_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/217.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/217.patch"},"body":"Fixed an issue where viewport sizes could be a pixel smaller in either\ndimension in certain situations.

requires the\nwidth and height of the texture atlas has been deprecated in\nfavour of the newly added static factory methods:\nNiftyJmeDisplay.newNiftyJmeDisplay(). The new methods\nadd support for the Nifty BatchRenderConfiguration class that\nallow further configuration of some rendering details.\n\nThe testcase jme3test.niftygui.TestNiftyGui has been modified\nto use the new methods and seems to render fine for me.\n\nMost of Nifty 1.4.1 should be compatible with old versions of\nNifty. However some compile-time incompatibilities might\nexists to old 1.3.x code. Additionally some internal mechanism\nhave been modified with 1.4 so there might be additional runtime\nincompatibilities as well.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/212","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/212/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/212/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/212/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/212","id":56088310,"number":212,"title":"Missing accessor restricts extending AbstractShadowRenderer","user":{"login":"jayfella","id":2816465,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2816465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayfella","html_url":"https://github.com/jayfella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayfella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayfella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayfella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayfella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayfella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayfella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayfella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayfella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayfella/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":87349292,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-01-30T21:41:05Z","updated_at":"2015-07-04T17:01:50Z","closed_at":"2015-07-04T17:01:50Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"the following line: https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/blob/6e287d0ef2d619c62524ae5245721d490b168cd7/jme3-core/src/main/java/com/jme3/shadow/AbstractShadowRenderer.java#L467\n\nis missing the \"protected\" accessor  and therefore does not allow extending the class as shown here: http://puu.sh/ffqO9/b4eff5593b.png\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4982","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507317096","x-github-request-id":"C320:366F:105227:221392:59D7C7CE","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/17960746/issues?state=all&page=19>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/17960746/issues?state=all&page=26>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/17960746/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/17960746/issues?state=all&page=17>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"eba0f496aceaa37431f1a6411c44fc86\"","status":"200 OK"}}
