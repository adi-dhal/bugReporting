It is package private to not pollute namespace. Also added handling of tabs to getLineWidth().\r\n\r\n- BitmapText: Only changed Javadoc. An important precondition is that the tab positions are sorted. I refrained from adding an Arrays.sort() call because the user shouldn't pay for what he doesn't need.\r\n\r\n- LetterQuad: Removed faulty tab width calculation. It's in StringBlock now.\r\n\r\n- StringBlock: Uses DEFAULT_TAB_WIDTH constant when instantiated. Removed the getters for tabWidth/tabPos. Added calculation of tab position at the bottom. The only way \"tabPos\" can leave this class now is through cloning. But since the array-reference is overwritten in setTabPosition(), it can safely be shared across cloned instances. The tabPos array is cloned in the setter to prevent modifications through the original reference.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/581","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/581/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/581/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/581/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/581","id":194855970,"number":581,"title":"Fix some problems in issue #96 (SDK branch)","user":{"login":"Ev1lbl0w","id":6501975,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6501975?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ev1lbl0w","html_url":"https://github.com/Ev1lbl0w","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ev1lbl0w/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ev1lbl0w/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ev1lbl0w/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ev1lbl0w/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ev1lbl0w/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ev1lbl0w/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ev1lbl0w/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ev1lbl0w/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ev1lbl0w/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-12-11T20:58:00Z","updated_at":"2016-12-31T22:28:00Z","closed_at":"2016-12-31T22:27:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pulls/581","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/581","diff_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/581.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/581.patch"},"body":"Some problems launching examples of JmeTests (described in issue [#96](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/sdk/issues/96), SDK branch).
