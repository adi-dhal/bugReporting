Guys,\nSo the issue is essentially this: With the switch to HW Skinning the Serialization of animated Models changed in two ways:\na) We try to serialize \"NumOfBones\" and \"BoneMatrices\" as MatParams. This is wrong since they are regenrated every frame and trigger our \"does not support shared materials\" warning (since the matrices simply aren't equal)\n\nb) We couldn't serialize Arrays of Matrixf and others so the BoneMatrices were actually null\n\nTo fix this issue I proposed the \"MatParams\" Fix along with the Transiency Attribute for Materials. The Problem here is that since this Information is stored in Material it's decoupled from SkeletonControl.\nSee [here](https://github.com/MeFisto94/jmonkeyengine/tree/MatParams). It still misses the j3md part, some testing and a more clever array serialization, though.\n\n\"Also I noticed that you’re assuming that all matparam arrays are savable arrays in the code, you should probably make sure that they are specifically a Savable[]\"\n\nThe reason I didn't create a PR is because instead of hacking this in an deleting it in 3.2 again, it might be better to simply backport the 3.2 MPO SkeletonControl to 3.1 and make use of it.\n\nNo matter what, we have to do something since it's currently preventing any sdk from loading/saving any animated model\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/498","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/498/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/498/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/498/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/498","id":156120353,"number":498,"title":"Add/remove all PhysicsControls even when a RigidBodyControl is present","user":{"login":"TripleSnail","id":1473454,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1473454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TripleSnail","html_url":"https://github.com/TripleSnail","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TripleSnail/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TripleSnail/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TripleSnail/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TripleSnail/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TripleSnail/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TripleSnail/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TripleSnail/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TripleSnail/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TripleSnail/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-05-21T20:34:39Z","updated_at":"2017-04-25T11:26:05Z","closed_at":"2017-04-25T11:25:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pulls/498","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/498","diff_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/498.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/498.patch"},"body":"The current implementation of addAll / removeAll doesn't remove rest of the PhysicsControls if the spatial has a RigidBodyControl.\n\nThis pull request removes the else-branch so that add / remove is always called for the spatial.
