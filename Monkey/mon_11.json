constructor doesn't \"Only copies the name and bind pose from the original.\". It takes the object references from the original which leads to shared bind transforms.\n\nFor example several same models are loaded and each model should have different e.g. arm sizes. If all models shares the same bind object references, all models have the same arm size instead of different ones.\n\nA simple clone() makes a real copy and fixes this problem. Now its prossible to have different sized and bone animated arms.\n\nHint:\n\nenabling UserControl disable bone animations, so this is not the way I want. I want bone affected by animations and customized bone transforms (bind transforms).\n\nForum link: http://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/t/bug-bone-animations-share-their-bind-transforms/35217\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/435/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/434","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/434/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/434/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/434/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/434","id":137710861,"number":434,"title":"Fixed the Issue where removing a Control didn't set the dirty flag","user":{"login":"MeFisto94","id":12577813,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/12577813?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeFisto94","html_url":"https://github.com/MeFisto94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeFisto94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeFisto94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeFisto94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeFisto94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeFisto94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeFisto94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeFisto94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeFisto94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeFisto94/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-03-01T22:50:43Z","updated_at":"2016-03-02T20:08:06Z","closed_at":"2016-03-02T19:25:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pulls/434","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/434","diff_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/434.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/434.patch"},"body":"See http://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/t/dirty-flag-not-set-when-deleting-model-controls/35216\nbtw: Fix Imports removed some unused imports and the \"fireSave\" Override is lent from JmeLight.java\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/434/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/433","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/433/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/433/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/433/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/433","id":137632076,"number":433,"title":"LWJGL 3 context cannot be created on Mac OS X","user":{"login":"shadowislord","id":6314496,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6314496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shadowislord","html_url":"https://github.com/shadowislord","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shadowislord/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shadowislord/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shadowislord/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shadowislord/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shadowislord/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shadowislord/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shadowislord/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shadowislord/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shadowislord/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":87349292,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-03-01T17:03:37Z","updated_at":"2016-03-14T20:56:04Z","closed_at":"2016-03-14T20:56:04Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Mac OS X requires window management code to run on the main thread.
