I mentioned at the Forum (https://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/t/sky-sphere-rotates-the-wrong-direction/38090?u=sgold) there's an issue with rotation of cube-mapped skies, in that rotations affects them differently than other spatials. I tracked this down to the vertex shader (Common/MatDefs/Misc/Sky.vert) used by com.jme3.util.SkyFactory, so it presumably affects sphere-mapped  and equirect-mapped skies as well. Skies ignore translation and scaling somehow. (Rémy told me the rotation is applied in view space.) If I invert the rotation before applying it to the geometry, I get the rotation I intended, so I assume this behavior could be corrected by inverting the rotation before applying it in view space.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/651/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/650","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/650/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/650/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/650/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/650","id":226149941,"number":650,"title":"Updated KeyListener for enter and escape.","user":{"login":"mitm001","id":23060179,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/23060179?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitm001","html_url":"https://github.com/mitm001","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitm001/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitm001/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitm001/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitm001/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitm001/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitm001/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitm001/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitm001/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitm001/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-05-04T00:21:58Z","updated_at":"2017-08-31T19:24:45Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pulls/650","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/650","diff_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/650.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/650.patch"},"body":"Listener does not work for newer versions of java.

getAttachmentsNode() assumed no local transform on any geometry with an animated mesh. However, Jaime violates this assumption. To make attachment nodes work more generally, each bone with attachments needs a target geometry. When the bone updates its transforms, it checks to see whether (1) the target geometry has the same parent as the attachments node and (2) whether its local transform is IDENTITY. If both these conditions are met (most models) the bone applies model transforms directly to the attachments node as before. If not, it adjusts the transform. My code assumes the parent of the attachment node is an ancestor of the target geometry. It also assumes all geometries with animated meshes have the same world transform. Formerly, getAttachmentsNode() failed if the spatial controlled by SkeletonControl was a Geometry. I've tried to allow for this possibility, though I didn't test.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/636","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/636/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/636/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/636/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/636","id":219750496,"number":636,"title":"Link in WaterFilter documentation is 404","user":{"login":"fscheffer","id":1678164,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1678164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fscheffer","html_url":"https://github.com/fscheffer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fscheffer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fscheffer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fscheffer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fscheffer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fscheffer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fscheffer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fscheffer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fscheffer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fscheffer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-04-06T00:06:53Z","updated_at":"2017-05-31T19:17:54Z","closed_at":"2017-05-31T19:17:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The documentation for **com.jme3.water.WaterFilter** refers to a blog post\r\n\r\n> http://jmonkeyengine.org/2011/01/15/new-advanced-water-effect-for-jmonkeyengine-3\r\n\r\nwhich returns \"404 - File not found\".","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/636/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/635","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/635/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/635/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/635/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/635","id":218700445,"number":635,"title":"InstancedNode : get exceptions on Android with jme3.1-stable","user":{"login":"jmecn","id":5283598,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5283598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmecn","html_url":"https://github.com/jmecn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmecn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmecn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmecn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmecn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmecn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmecn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmecn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmecn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmecn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-04-01T14:47:02Z","updated_at":"2017-09-15T01:35:28Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Just tried jme3test.scene.instance.TestInstanceNode on Android.

See 479392f\r\n\r\nB) TestMipMapGen: We have two MipMapGenerator's. One in jme3-desktop and one in jme3-core. The Desktop pendant uses AWT, which doesn't work on Android. Technically they should do the same so the question is if there is a valid reason to still keep the one in jme3-desktop? See 10b23db\r\n\r\nThose commits are only applied to 3.1 because I actually pushed them by mistake (my old git tool always asked for the appropriate remote, for this one you have to set it in the settings), so sorry for the inconvenience.\r\n\r\nC) TestRenderToMemory uses `jme3-desktop`'s `com.jme3.util.Screenshots`.\r\nBy looking into Screenshots it seems to me that it only depends on AWT for the Buffers however we already have our own buffer implementations so we might be independent from AWT here?\r\nApart from that `convertScreenShot2` is a horrible name for jme buffer to Image Object and the name `Screenshot` itself is also a bit misleading.\r\nI don't know what to do there since I am unfamiliar with the classes, though.\r\n\r\nD) TestAbsoluteLocators depends on `AWTLoader` for the textures however I don't think it's possible to have some conditional code for Android there? Maybe we could add a TestAbsoluteLocatorsAndroid and the SDK deletes the relevant test?\r\n\r\nE) The whole `jme3test.awt` package is useless on Android. There are neither Applets nor AWT Canvases to use. The SDK will simply remove the AWT package when creating the Android Tests.
