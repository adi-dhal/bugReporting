using float Custom Properties in Blender, `getUserData` will sometimes return NaN. It seems to work for fractions divisible by a power of 2 (eg 1.5, 0.5, 0.0625), but returns NaN for others (eg 1.1, 0.1, 0.05). Someone else encountered this issue a few months ago: https://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/t/blender-exporter-exporting-custom-property-float-is-nan/38135\r\n\r\nThis is most likely due to some rounding errors somewhere in the import/loading pipeline.\r\n\r\nTo test, I created a BasicGame, created a model using `New > Blender > Box prepared for UV texturing`, added a Custom Property to the Cube object, converted to J3O Binary, and added the following code to `simpleInitApp`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        Spatial customproperty = assetManager.loadModel(\"Models/customproperty.j3o\");\r\n        Spatial cube = ((Node)customproperty).getChild(\"Cube\");\r\n        float prop = cube.getUserData(\"prop\");\r\n        System.out.println(prop);\r\n```\r\n\r\nTested with releases

already has support to render to a swing window via the JmeCanvasContext. It, however, has no such support for JavaFx. I would like to request that this support be added.\r\n\r\nThis feature would allow for tools to be made that work with JME using a modern GUI framework, thus improving the quality of JME significantly. \r\n\r\nThere are several ways I can see this being done from a technical standpoint:\r\n - Render to a borderless Swing or LWJGL window and move that window around to match a javafx component while always on top. I tried implementing this, and it works but is also _very_ buggy.\r\n - (https://github.com/empirephoenix/JME3-JFX)[This]. I tried to get this api working, but the documention is incredibly poor and the project also appears inactive.\r\n - (https://github.com/SgtRumbi/LWJGLJavaFX)[This]. Since this seems to allow the opengl rendering from JME to be inserted directly into JavaFx's rendering, I think this is the best option. It avoids the buggyness of a swing window overlay, and should be more efficient that JME3-JFX's method of shuffling images around.
