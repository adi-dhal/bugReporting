In both cases, loadAsset() sets the JmeCursor's xHotSpot and yHotSpot correctly, even where they are non-zero.\n\n(1) What JME version(s) have this issue?\n(2) Can you provide an example CUR file which illustrates the issue? \n\n---\n\nCorrection: it looks like the yHotSpot is always set to height-1 in both 3.0.5 and trunk.  So there's a reproducible issue here.\n\nGoogle Code isn't letting me update the status to Open.  Be it known that I take ownership of this issue.\n\nReference on googlecode: https://code.google.com/p/jmonkeyengine/issues/detail?id=638\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/114","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/114/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/114/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/114/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/114","id":30067781,"number":114,"title":"TestQ3 won't run from JmeTests","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":88041637,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/labels/defect","name":"defect","color":"fbca04","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"stephengold","id":2287609,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2287609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephengold","html_url":"https://github.com/stephengold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephengold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephengold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephengold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephengold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephengold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephengold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephengold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephengold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephengold/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"stephengold","id":2287609,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2287609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephengold","html_url":"https://github.com/stephengold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephengold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephengold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephengold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephengold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephengold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephengold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephengold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephengold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephengold/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-03-24T19:35:05Z","updated_at":"2014-11-06T02:03:38Z","closed_at":"2014-11-06T02:03:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**What steps will reproduce the problem?**\n1.
