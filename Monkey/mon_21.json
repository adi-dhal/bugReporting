I also have replaced clipX/clipY/clipW/clipH with a ClipRectangle object and added several new ClipRectangle objects. Their purpose is as follows:\n\ncurrentClipRect - Contains the dimensions of the clip rectangle currently set with glScissor(). Updates are compared against this to check if a glScissor() call is necessary.\nrendererClipRect - Contains the dimensions of the clip rectangle from the last call of setClipRect(). In the event that clipRectEnabled is true and renderStateClipRectEnabled is false currentClipRect should be logically equivalent to this.\nrenderStateClipRect - Contains the dimensions of the clip rectangle from the last call of applyRenderState assuming that Material.setClipTest() and Material.setClipRect() were true. In the event that clipRectEnabled is false and renderStateClipRectEnabled is true currentClipRect should be logically equivalent to this.\nintersectionClipRect - Contains the dimensions of the clip rectangle that is the intersection of both clip rectangles set by setClipRect() and applyRenderState(). In the event that both clipRectEnabled and renderStateClipRectEnabled are true currentClipRect should be logically equivalent to this if the intersection is valid, otherwise it is zeroed.\n\nSome changes to setClipRect() and clearClipRect() were required with the intention that it functions as a master switch. setClipRect() will always result in GL_SCISSOR_TEST being enabled and glScissor/currentClipRect being set to the values entered. clearClipRect() will always result in GL_SCISSOR_TEST being

minor issue, but a nasty pitfall that can cause hours of debugging.\n\nThe default MTL Loader plugin uses the d or the tr option to enable transparency, if detected.\n\nThis is done [here](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/blob/master/jme3-core/src/plugins/java/com/jme3/scene/plugins/MTLLoader.java#L224).\n\nIt says:\n\n``` java\nif (tempAlpha != 0){\n    alpha = tempAlpha;\n    transparent = true;\n}\n```\n\nThe problem is: if alpha is 1.0, then the material is actually _not_ transparent, but is loaded as transparent (because 1.0 != 0).\n\nFor instance the default value for opaque materials when exporting MTL files with Blender is 1.0.\n\nThat means, the MTL Loader would load any material as transparent and the OBJLoader would [put the geometry into the Transparent Bucket](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/blob/master/jme3-core/src/plugins/java/com/jme3/scene/plugins/OBJLoader.java#L422).\n\nThis causes problems when transparent objects are close in front of opaque objects - you can then see through both (e.g. a holographic monitor inside a cockpit).\n\n_Possible workarounds:_\n- Override MTL Loader (not a good soluation if you want to load the j3o files, the SDK creates for you by using the default MTL Loader)\n- Force this setting with your model editor - also not good: might cause the material to be fully transparent in this editor\n- Edit the MTL file so that the d or tr parameter reads 0 for opaque materials\n\n_Possible fix:_\nChange the code of jmonkey, so that the above lines read...\n\n``` java\nif (tempAlpha < 1.f) {\n    alpha = tempAlpha;\n    transparent = true;\n}\n```\n\nIf you feel this shouldn't be fixed in code, please think about mentioning it in the tutorials / documentation somewhere.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/126","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/126/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/126/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/126/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/126","id":31764119,"number":126,"title":"Add
