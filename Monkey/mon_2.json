caches a BIHTree for any mesh containing 1 or more vertices, then uses the BIHTree to detect collisions. If the mesh does not consist of triangles (if the mode is Line or Points or anything but Triangles/TriangleStrip/TriangleFan) it generates a BIHTree anyway, treating each triad of vertices in the WrappedIndexBuffer as if it were a triangle. As a result, Mesh.collideWith() sometimes reports collisions with phantom triangles: triangles that don't exist in any mesh.\r\n\r\nI believe I know how to correct this issue.
