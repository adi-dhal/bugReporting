The returned object is of type AbstractControl anyway, the caller just doesn't know that.\n\nI would suggest changing it like this:\n\n@Override\npublic AbstractControl cloneForSpatial(Spatial spatial){\n   //No changes to actual code.\n}\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/164/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/163","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/163/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/163/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/163/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/163","id":39348651,"number":163,"title":"Highlight filter","user":{"login":"shamanDevel","id":1770337,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1770337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shamanDevel","html_url":"https://github.com/shamanDevel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shamanDevel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shamanDevel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shamanDevel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shamanDevel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shamanDevel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shamanDevel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shamanDevel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shamanDevel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shamanDevel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-08-02T13:05:04Z","updated_at":"2014-08-14T09:11:28Z","closed_at":"2014-08-14T09:11:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pulls/163","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/163","diff_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/163.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/163.patch"},"body":"This Pull Request adds a post processing filter that highlights objects in the scene.\nThe objects are highlighted by drawing a border around them.\nThe functionallity is simmilar to the glow effect. The scene is rendered using a specific 'Highlight' technique that is added to Lighting.j3md and Unshaded.j3md that renders only these objects that have to material property 'Highlighted' set to true.\nIn a post process, the shape edges are then extracted and drawn on the screen.\nThe edge color and thickness are customable.\n\nOther highlighting effects, such as drawing the object with flipped culling again, suffer from the fact that the outline may not be drawn complete. This issue is solved by this method. However, because the scene is rendered twice and the edges have to be detected, the performance decreases. If the edge thickness is very hight, this might be a problem.\n\nThe highlight filter also does not work when mutlisampling is enabled, for some unknown reason.\n\nHere are some screenshots from the

engine can load dds textures, but the SDK cannot display, open and edit them.\nHowever, I think that the dds texture format is one of the most important formats for textures, because it can be directly loaded into the GPU memory.\nTherefore, I've added support for these textures in the sdk.\n\nThese code changes come in four steps:\n1. Relax restrictions in the dds loader in the core engine\n2. Add libraries to load and store dds textures for the SDK\n3. Extend the module Texture-Editor\n4. Add a dialog that can convert textures\n\n<strong>1. Relax restrictions in the dds loader </strong>\nThe dds loader tests if the flag \"DDSCAPS_TEXTURE\" is set. However, there exists many vaild textures without these flags (valid because they can be loaded by the official dds loader). Especially the libraries in the next step create textures without that flag.\n\n<code>\ndiff --git a/jme3-core/src/plugins/java/com/jme3/texture/plugins/DDSLoader.java b/jme3-core/src/plugins/java/com/jme3/texture/plugins/DDSLoader.java\nindex 8ea46a7..8aa6749 100644\n--- a/jme3-core/src/plugins/java/com/jme3/texture/plugins/DDSLoader.java\n+++ b/jme3-core/src/plugins/java/com/jme3/texture/plugins/DDSLoader.java\n@@ -203,9 +203,10 @@ public class DDSLoader implements AssetLoader {\n         texture3D = false;\n\n```\n     if (!directx10) {\n```\n-            if (!is(caps1, DDSCAPS_TEXTURE)) {\n-                throw new IOException(\"File is not a texture\");\n-            }\n- ```\n        //ignore it, there exists many valid textures that have not this flag set\n  ```\n  \n  +//            if (!is(caps1, DDSCAPS_TEXTURE)) {\n  +//                throw new IOException(\"File is not a texture\");\n  +//            }\n  \n  ```\n       if (depth <= 0) {\n           depth = 1;\n  ```\n  \n  </code>\n\n<strong>2. Add libraries to load and store dds textures for the SDK</strong>\nI use the library https://code.google.com/p/java-dds/ for reading \nand https://github.com/Dahie/DDS-Utils for writing.\nThese libraries are a bit old and buggy, but the best I could find.\n\n<strong>3. Extend the module Texture-Editor</strong>\nIn this main step, the texture editor is extended, so that dds textures are recognized as textures and can be read and written.\n\n<strong>4. Add a dialog that can convert textures</strong>\nThe last step is an addon that allows to convert textures to a different format and also allows to compress the dds textures.\nThe SDK already support the texture compression tool, but it requires the tool from NVIDIA to be installed. This dialog has limited functionallity,\nbut it does not need additional executables. It is also directly integrated into the node structure.\n\nThis dialog looks like:\n![dds-converter](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1770337/3776475/0f371334-1955-11e4-9d29-dc38ff393289.jpg)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/160","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/160/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/160/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/160/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/160","id":38877767,"number":160,"title":"Utility methods for getting arbitrary properties for triangles from mesh","user":{"login":"abies","id":574723,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/574723?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abies","html_url":"https://github.com/abies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abies/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-07-28T10:23:21Z","updated_at":"2015-07-13T22:51:56Z","closed_at":"2015-07-13T22:51:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pulls/160","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/160","diff_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/160.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/160.patch"},"body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/160/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/159","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/159/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/159/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/159/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/159","id":38875136,"number":159,"title":"Constructors of Picture don't make Quad resulting in null mesh error","user":{"login":"husainhz7","id":5118846,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5118846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/husainhz7","html_url":"https://github.com/husainhz7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/husainhz7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/husainhz7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/husainhz7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/husainhz7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/husainhz7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/husainhz7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/husainhz7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/husainhz7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/husainhz7/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-07-28T09:43:50Z","updated_at":"2014-08-21T14:00:47Z","closed_at":"2014-08-21T14:00:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello\nThe second and third constructor of the picture class doesn't make the mesh.
