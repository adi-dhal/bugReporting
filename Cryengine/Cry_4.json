Anything below 8.0 mass starts physics objects to move upward.\r\n\r\nThis seem to be somehow related to the rigidbody density. If I set density manually for the cube and put 1.0 for density, cube floats in the air, which could be explained if CE assumes that the density of air is 1.0 kg/m^3.\r\n\r\nSince the cube is 1m x 1m x 1m = 1m^3, 1.0kg in mass should equal 1.0 density but that doesn't happen now. 1kg in mass clearly flies the object to the sky, same with 5.0 in mass, where 1.0 in density floats the box in the air (doesn't move down or up) and 5.0 clearly falls down like it should.\r\n\r\nThere could be many things going wrong here, but it seems like automatically calculated density is one. Even if your paper box would weigh 100 grams, it shouldn't fly into sky.\r\n\r\nAnd like mentioned in the beginning, this happens when you have Wind setup, if you put 0,0,0 as wind vector, gravity works like you'd expect.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/210/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/209","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/209/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/209/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/209/events","html_url":"https://github.com/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/209","id":246580891,"number":209,"title":"5.4

since schematyc insisted on being loaded and unloaded in a very specific order, I looked into prototyping a plugin load/unload priority mechanism lol, if you want a read/my rudimentary implementation idea;\r\n\r\n## [General Idea]\r\nI opted to leave the ordering mostly to the coders, whilst initially separating system plugins from user (default) plugins, but allowing flexibility to override if need be.\r\nBasically I just isolated the Initialize() method for the plugins away from the class instantiation, the plugins initialize in the order they arrive, but the ICryPlugin interface method to Initialize() is called in the order of the ICryPlugin Priorities (order of arrival if matching priority).\r\n\r\n## [Implementation]\r\nSimply added a couple int16s (m_loadPriority/m_unloadPriority) to the ICryPlugin class as protected friends to CryPluginManager.\r\nLoad/Unload creates a temp vector sorted by these values.\r\n\r\n## [Details (Load)]\r\nDuring load a temporary **vector<IcryPlugin*> containerPtrs** is created.\r\nA range loop iterates over **m_pluginContainer**(s ?) and pushes a pointer into **containerPtrs** for each element.\r\nQuick call to **std::set** via lambda results in a sorted list by **containerPtrs[n]->m_pPlugin->m_loadPriority**.\r\nAnother range loop iterates over **containerPtrs** and calls **containerPtrs[n]->m_pPlugin->Initialize(...)** on each element.\r\nThen a quick **std::erase/remove** clears all the lements that failed to initialize by checking **containerPtrs[n]->m_bFailedInit**\r\n\r\n## [Details (Unload)]\r\nAgain a temp vector **containerPtrs** is created.\r\nAnother range loop copies pointers to eachelement as before.\r\nNow a **std::reverse** initially reverses the entire vector.\r\nThen a quick sort (reverse of load sort) sorts everything by **containerPtrs[n]->m_pPlugin->m_unloadPriority**.\r\n\r\n## [Modifications]\r\nHad to modify Cryengine Plugins to include the necessary priorities in their plugin constructors.\r\nModified **SPluginContainer** to set **m_bFailedInit** on failed Initialization/null plugin ptr.\r\nSpecifically modified Schematyc plugins for special unload priorities. (this finally fixed my exit crash :P)\r\nAlso had to move intialization of **STDEnv** member pointers such as **m_pSystemStateMonitor** into the Initialize method.^^\r\n\r\n^^ - The constructors in these classes assume Core is already Initalized. True in the default implementation as Init follows immediately after Instantiation.\r\n\r\n## [Use Notes]\r\nThere is a new enum in **ICryPlugin** to help clarify and provide flexibility with priorities.\r\n```\tenum EPluginPriority : int16\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tEPluginPriority_CryUnload = -100,\t// Lowest priority\r\n\t\tEPluginPriority_Default = 0,\r\n\t\tEPluginPriority_CryLoad = 100\t// Highest priority\r\n\t};\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll you have to do is put this in your plugin (**ICryPlugin** Inheritor) constructor:\r\n```\tm_loadPriority = EPluginPriority_Default;\r\n\tm_unloadPriority = EPluginPriority_Default;\r\n```\r\n\t\r\nThen in another plugin you can (un)load in you desired order:\r\n```\tm_loadPriority = EPluginPriority_Default-1; // Lower priority\r\n\tm_unloadPriority = EPluginPriority_Default+1; // Higher priority\r\n```\r\n\r\n----\r\nIt feels hackish ha, but I dunno gives a bit of freedom. Only reason I had to do this is because I didn't want to chase invalidated virtual pointers because schematyc unload wasnt just so xD. Maybe unnecessary in future builds anyway.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/188/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4994","x-ratelimit-reset":"1506803959","x-github-request-id":"B0AC:028A:1578924:25F01FE:59CFF4E7","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/59480719/issues?state=all&page=5>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/59480719/issues?state=all&page=11>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/59480719/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/59480719/issues?state=all&page=3>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"931217e33c32fbed502c88d087534365\"","status":"200 OK"}}
