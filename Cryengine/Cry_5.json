You can't bind an rvalue to non-const lvalue reference, So it is ill-formed.\r\nWhen /permissive- isn't used, MSVC has an extension which treats rvalue class as lvalue, so it happens to compile.\r\n\r\nOur suggestion is to remove the Microsoft-specific code path and use SFINAE to correctly implement non_intrusive.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/178/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/177","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/177/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/177/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/177/events","html_url":"https://github.com/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/177","id":223523263,"number":177,"title":"Issues in 3rdparty libraries when building with MSVC and /permissive-","user":{"login":"xiangfan-ms","id":25832891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25832891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfan-ms","html_url":"https://github.com/xiangfan-ms","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfan-ms/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfan-ms/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfan-ms/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfan-ms/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfan-ms/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfan-ms/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfan-ms/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfan-ms/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfan-ms/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-04-21T23:42:58Z","updated_at":"2017-04-21T23:47:32Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\r\nI’m a developer in Visual C++ compiler team.
