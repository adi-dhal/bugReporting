CryEngine Team\n\nHere are some fixes I encountered when I tired to compile the CryEngine on Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit.\nHere a list of fixes.\n1. At some points the sizeof(this) was used. I assume this is not intended. It should be *this if the size of the structure is meant. (GraphicsPipelineStateSet.h, GeomCacheRenderNode.cpp)\n2. 'override' operator missing. \n3. In CreateVariable, CreateArray in the FlashUIElement, I think a endless loop was caused because the wrong parameter was used.\n4. fabsf compile errors.\n5. [-Werror,-Wshift-negative-value] compile errors. Some occurred in the SDLs projects like zlib etc. Maybe for clang the script compile_settings_clang.pyc can have the '-Wno-shift-negative-value' flag. Better all issues should be fixed.\n6. In DeviceWrapper12 wrong usage of the delete operator. I think it should be delete [].\n##### NOTE:\n\nIn the SDK's folder there is a project called yasli. There is a file TypeID.h, the line  174\n\n`#elif __GNUC__ >= 4 && __GNUC_MINOR__ >= 4`\n\nmust be replaced. The preprocessor flags are used wrong. When compiling the CryEngine with gcc that part will not be used. Here my suggestion (or from GNU Team), use:\n\n`#define GCC_VERSION (__GNUC__ * 10000 + __GNUC_MINOR__ * 100 + __GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__)`\n\nand replace line 174 with: \n\n`#elif GCC_VERSION > 40400`\n\nThis file has even more issues and asserts at s==send. I made a bug report about those #defines on the yasli project file and it seems they fixed it. Furthermore it has some fixes that causes an assert s==send. Using the new TypeID.h fixes this issue.\nFurthermore the SDK zip file has issues with some files because soft links to some files are not packed correct. I had to redo the soft linking by hand.\n\nHope you consider those fixes or at least look at them.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/11/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":2,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/10","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/10/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/10/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/10/events","html_url":"https://github.com/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/pull/10","id":156752707,"number":10,"title":" (ActionMapManager) Forced controller device opt-in and added warningâ¦","user":{"login":"ZephSolaris","id":2818337,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2818337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZephSolaris","html_url":"https://github.com/ZephSolaris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZephSolaris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZephSolaris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZephSolaris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZephSolaris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZephSolaris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZephSolaris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZephSolaris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZephSolaris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZephSolaris/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-05-25T13:37:07Z","updated_at":"2017-06-17T09:09:49Z","closed_at":"2017-06-17T09:09:49Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/pulls/10","html_url":"https://github.com/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/pull/10","diff_url":"https://github.com/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/pull/10.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/pull/10.patch"},"body":"When GameZero was released, I noticed that controller devices were getting mapped despite a typo in the action profile xml.
