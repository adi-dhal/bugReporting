So I thought I post it here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/99/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/98","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/98/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/98/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/98/events","html_url":"https://github.com/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/98","id":199965455,"number":98,"title":"Console command \"load <savegamename>\" bug","user":{"login":"emeniu","id":25044108,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25044108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emeniu","html_url":"https://github.com/emeniu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emeniu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emeniu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emeniu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emeniu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emeniu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emeniu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emeniu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emeniu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emeniu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-01-10T23:43:20Z","updated_at":"2017-08-09T14:58:36Z","closed_at":"2017-08-09T14:58:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"In 5.1 if you try to load a save by name, it doesnt pass the \".csf\" extension with the fileName.
