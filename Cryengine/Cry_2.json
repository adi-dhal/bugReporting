seems like there is no reliable and reasonable way at all for one component to run a piece of code after ALL the components of an entity has been initialized.\r\n\r\nThere also seems to be a practice of physicalizing inside the Initialize method of components which I can't make sense out of. Components should act together to form an entity, so the physicalization should take place after all components have been initialized, and not when the entity is in a semi-initialized state.\r\n\r\nI think this is a architectural bug, because if one component's physical state can be affected by another component, then we should initialize all components first and then ask them to physicalize.\r\n\r\nThis issue is not limited to physicalization but is very general.\r\n\r\nI found the ENTITY_EVENT_INIT event which can be used _sometimes_. The event is sent after all components have been Initialized. But it is not sent for spawned entities. My temporary workaround for this is to manually send this event every time I spawn an event, so that I can always do first-time logic when the entity is in a fully-initialized state.\r\n\r\nI think this issue can and should be fixed before 5.4 launch. It is very easy - add a new event and call it ENTITY_EVENT_PHYSICALIZE or ENTITY_EVENT_BEGIN or whatever. Send this event if all its components have been initialized and when the entity is added to the world.\r\n\r\nFor spawned entities, the entity system needs to keep track of newly spawned entities and send them this event just like it deals with m_deletedEntities in EntitySystem.cpp line 1026. Simply loop through a list of spawned entities and send them the BEGIN event and then clear the list.\r\n\r\nFor non-spawned entities, this event need to be sent where ENTITY_EVENT_INIT is sent (after component initialization, before world update).\r\n\r\nWhen adding a new component to an existing and already added entity, this component should receive the event immediately after its Initialize has been called.\r\n\r\nPractical example of how and why this is an architectural issue: The CCharacterControllerComponent physicalizes itself in its Initialize function. I have a component that in its Initialize function calls GetOrCreateComponent on the CCharacterControllerComponent. This effectively forces the order of initialization to first initialize the CCharacterControllerComponent and then my component. That is an issue because if I want to modify a few physics properties first I can't do that. I understand that there are hacky ways of solving this by grabbing the physical entity and modifying it but that is just what I am talking about, an architectural issue.\r\n\r\nHow the proposed new event would solve the particular example of the CCharacterControllerComponent:\r\n1) All components are initialized, CCharacterControllerComponent does NOT physicalize, but it exposes a physics params struct that my component can modify\r\n2) All components receive the BEGIN event and physicalize from a **fully-initialized entity state**\r\n\r\nPlease consider adding this event before 5.4 since it would be the only reliable way of doing some component-relational logic before entities enter the world.
