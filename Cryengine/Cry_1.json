the title says, I have everything setup perfectly but the boolean destruction crashes the engine.

I use the palm tree asset to test this and upon colliding a heavy mesh with the tree, I can see the tree break using \"p_draw_helpers 2\" but it crashes a second after that. The crash happens in UpdateDeformableStatObj of Cry3DEngine at line 836. Now this all works fine in GameSDK.

Deleting the file manually under libs\\uiaction works fine then restarting the Editor. The issue is gone. It's just deleting the entry via Sandbox Editor that has issues.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce :\r\n1. Open up Sandbox Editor.\r\n2. Open up a level.\r\n3. Open up Flowgraph Editor.\r\n4. Create custom UIAction with a name, slick save.\r\n5. Populate UIAction with UI:Action:Start, additional FG nodes and UI:Action:End.\r\n6. Call the UIAction with UI:Action:Control.\r\n7. Rightclick custom UIAction name and click Delete.\r\n8.
