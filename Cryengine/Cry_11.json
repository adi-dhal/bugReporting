Because of m_fAnimTimePrev being zero, the system would send the same animation event an excessive amount of times. (In our case giving the player a crapload of extra impulses!)\n\nThe fix we performed for this was to always set m_fAnimTimePrev to the same value as m_fAnimTime when manually seeking. This is done since there is not really a previous time, or if there was then it would be invalid if playing animations backwards.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/5/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/4","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/4/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/4/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/issues/4/events","html_url":"https://github.com/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE/pull/4","id":156667604,"number":4,"title":"CRYENGINE
