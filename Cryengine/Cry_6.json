compared  Cryengine C# API with C++ API, I found from class list that class is too little by C# API provided.such as no classes for can controlling AI animation and controlling AI behavior ,controlling AI movement, controlling material ,controlling shader, controlling render ,controlling VR ,controlling lighting ,controlling physics interaction, controlling particle effect, controlling audio interaction,etc.... in a word,Cryengine C# API is not complete.this will result in C# user can not make full use of C#'s advantages to develop complete game or VR project with Cryengine
