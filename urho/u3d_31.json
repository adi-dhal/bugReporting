If Cadaver remembers I wanted to make this aaaages ago when I was first asking how the threading system worked, and now there's some great building blocks already to implement this well like streaming off another thread + GetTempResource to chew it down the WorkQueue via Intel's very fast ISPC GPU texture encoders, if transcoding is needed from a compressed format as one example.\n\n**What is it?**\nA way to stream in very large textures from storage and not have it all residing in memory.\n\n**Why is it cool?**\nGames demand very high quality and very high res textures these days, and look unique and render fast without being too fillrate-heavy. Virtual Texturing allows this, and it can reduce state changes dramatically as the texture units don't need to be changed as you're accessing the same texture unit for each opaque drawable which uses the virtual texture.\n\n**What is needed/how would it be implemented?**\n- I'd imagine a VirtualTexture class would be made which is API-agnostic, and the Image and API-specific Texture classes would be extended to support efficient texture uploads using the most optimal way per-API eg. PBOs on OpenGL, or just use what they have as-is and see if it's fast enough. An LRU list would be made to determine what texture tiles/mips are in-use and free up ones which are not being used, so that new ones can stream in.\n- Support GL 4.x/DX11 sparse/tileable textures (if it makes sense and there's a speed-up). If you only target these GPUs which support this extension and not DX9, you could remove the requirement of borders around the tiles.\n- To determine which texture tiles are needed for a frame, there are a few ways to detect this. The most common way is to render the whole scene to a small render buffer with a special shader and let the CPU read it back to determine which tile/mip texture is needed. Commonly the UVs and mip-map are rendered, and the CPU would then use this as a hash to pick up the right tile and load it in asynchronously from disk, with the option to transcode it to a GPU compressed format before uploading to the GPU. This can cause bad stalls so I'd like to investigate if something along the lines of the software occlusion query rasterizer could also do UV+mip detection, but perhaps it might not be too bad in practice (as the software solution can be very limited to only the occluder objects having a virtual texture). Modern APIs can have accurate sync points to hide the stalls, or not cause stalls at all with correct pipelining.\n- This involves a toolset to easily convert assets into tileable texture resources and UV offsetting. This is very important because an artist will not sit there stitching their asset textures and re-arranging all their asset UVs to cater virtual texturing. Also a way to set tile size and border size which is optimal for the platform (4x4 border for desktop DXT1/DXT5-compressed textures, or 8x8 if using ASTC on mobile, for example).\n- The existing packing system could be used (or extended) also to store these large textures, but instead of strings for filenames it could be hashes for the UV+mip for fast lookups and keeping offset+size info in memory for all the tiles. The files inside could be multiple PBR texture layers.\n\n**Virtual Texturing sucks, look at the game Rage's streaming issues and large storage costs**\n- In some cases it can, but I believe it can have huge wins for some requirements. For example, large terrain which defers the splat sample mixing commonly done on large terrains to smaller tiles asynchronously to reduce fill-rate instead of doing the splat sample mixing per-frame directly onto the terrain which is traditionally done. It also allows a lot more splat layers. Doing procedural textures could be elegantly realised using virtual textures efficiently also.\n- The streaming issue could be fixed with later APIs and being smarter about the older ones where possible, or simply having clever fade-in shaders to go between the mip levels.\n\nThoughts? No idea when I can get around to this, just throwing it out there as a cool feature to have... :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1230/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1229","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1229/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1229/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1229/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1229","id":139458057,"number":1229,"title":"Add

The main motivation behind this change is the ability to use doubles because these days, on desktop computers, there is no performance advantage for using floats over doubles. This is not the case for Android afaik.\n\nAs mentioned on the forums ([http://urho3d.prophpbb.com/topic1903.html](http://urho3d.prophpbb.com/topic1903.html)) all of the math functions force you to use floats.\n## Overview of changes\n- All math functions (except for Random()) are now templated. The default implementation calls sin(), cos(), etc. but there exist template specializations for floats which call sinf(), cosf(), etc.\n- AngelScript and Lua bindings expose `<float>` specializations (same as before). It might be worth considering a `URHO3D_USE_DOUBLES` option to have scripts use doubles instead of floats.\n- The math constants M_INFINITY, M_EPSILON, M_MIN_INT, M_MAX_INT, M_MIN_UNSIGNED, M_MAX_UNSIGNED were moved to a \"private\" file in `Urho3D/Math/Internal/Script` and defined using a new template `Limits<T>` which acts as a wrapper around `std::numeric_limits<T>`. All occurrences of these constants were replaced with Limits<T> **except** in script bindings. This change was made because the values of epsilon and infinity depend on the type (float, double, or long double), and the values of integer ranges depend on the type's width.\n- AngelScript bindings still expose the constants M_INFINITY, M_EPSILON, etc. However, they are defined using `Limits<float>`, `Limits<signed>` and `Limits<unsigned>`. The definitions of these \"old\" constants reside in files `Urho3D/Math/Internal/Script/ScriptSpecificMathDefs.h` and `Urho3D/Math/Internal/Script/ScriptSpecificMathDefs.cpp`.\n- The same is true for Lua bindings.\n- Due to an issue with MSVC, I've added /DNOMINMAX as a global definition to disable the macros `min()` and `max()` on Windows, as they conflicted with `std::numeric_limits<T>::min()/max()`.\n- A lot of explicit casting between signed/unsigned types were causing compilation errors with the new templated functions. This was fixed, and is the main cause for the massive amount of files changed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1219","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1219/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1219/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1219/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1219","id":137186388,"number":1219,"title":"Enhance Audio/Graphics/Input subsystem to support new SDL 2.0.4 improvement","user":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038070,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-02-29T08:32:19Z","updated_at":"2016-11-27T15:51:33Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"Once SDL 2.0.4 is merged to master branch we should enhance the engine's Audio subsystem to take advantage of the new improvement made in the SDL, e.g.:\r\n- Audio mode: callback vs queue.
