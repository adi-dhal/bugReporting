The result was that in rare cases particle emitter was not emitting particles, even it was visible by camera.

you change the font to something that doesn't exist and fire up the editor it hangs.  I don't know if its a true hang it kind of looks like its stuck in a loop.  It keeps spewing errors in the log.\n\nIf you do the same to the EditorAttributeText the font is simply not rendered.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/14/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/13","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/13/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/13/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/13/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/13","id":20787197,"number":13,"title":"Vertical orientation of text in ui elements","user":{"login":"friesencr","id":105460,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/105460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr","html_url":"https://github.com/friesencr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038072,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/question","name":"question","color":"cc317c","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/2/labels","id":593503,"number":2,"title":"1.32","description":null,"creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":278,"state":"closed","created_at":"2014-03-11T04:43:07Z","updated_at":"2015-07-16T05:18:08Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2014-11-28T04:55:53Z"},"comments":10,"created_at":"2013-10-10T04:47:39Z","updated_at":"2014-11-28T04:49:46Z","closed_at":"2014-10-25T20:29:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I have been digging in the font code and have been testing various fonts and finding some some problems.\n\nHere is a button with the text well within its bounds\n![Good button](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s35/res/d93e440b-6b42-433b-9667-f0a13e20f6d0/skitch.png?resizeSmall&width=366)\n\nIf you change the font these kinds of things happen.\n\nThe text is too low in general.\n![Bad button](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s35/res/46d104c5-9032-49d7-ae1c-eadcaac47a2d/skitch.png?resizeSmall&width=366)\n\nThe text is low, the icon is not centered.\n![Bad menu with icon](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s35/res/f832a92e-4048-4b48-bc59-37ef028c8847/skitch.png?resizeSmall&width=366)\n\nThe text is low within this menu container\n![Bad menu](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s35/res/cad14a0d-1abd-4e27-97d9-ff434114539c/skitch.png?resizeSmall&width=366)\n\nI don't know what the exact answer is.  It would be nice for people to be able to use whatever fonts they want in their games and have it work with minimal effort.  I do not have a nuanced knowledge of the rendering or glyph information to speak with authority but with most of the fonts i tested they were low.  We can maybe calculate the offsetY and height of some of the taller letters like M and get an average offset of those letters and position the fonts within a row of text.  From the offset vertical, middle, and baseline alignments can be made.  Another option would be to give the user a customizable value to change the verticle offset.  Using ems would be the most flexible as it would adjust with fontsizes but I don't think urho does anything with ems presently.\n\nOr maybe i am just overlooking a setting urho already has.  It wouldn't be the first time nor the last.\n\nThanks,\nChris\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/13/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/12","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/12/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/12/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/12/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/12","id":20783762,"number":12,"title":"Compiling with Urho3D as Library- Undefined References","user":{"login":"hjmediastudios","id":1511976,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1511976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjmediastudios","html_url":"https://github.com/hjmediastudios","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjmediastudios/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjmediastudios/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjmediastudios/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjmediastudios/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjmediastudios/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjmediastudios/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjmediastudios/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjmediastudios/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjmediastudios/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/1/labels","id":590529,"number":1,"title":"1.31","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":216,"state":"closed","created_at":"2014-03-07T14:42:58Z","updated_at":"2014-03-07T14:52:11Z","due_on":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2014-03-07T14:52:11Z"},"comments":5,"created_at":"2013-10-10T02:17:36Z","updated_at":"2015-08-30T23:05:42Z","closed_at":"2013-10-10T09:51:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In compiling an application using Urho3D (64-bit flavor, static library) linked as defined in the documentation, I get several errors of undefined references to pthread, OpenGL, and other 3rd-party libraries in the link stage, as shown below.
