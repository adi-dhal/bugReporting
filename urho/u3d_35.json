is a deficiency in the way we currently configure Urho3D project for iOS build. It is understandable that we cannot build for actual iPhone archs for all the sample apps due to code signing limitation. However, we can build for all archs when only building \"Urho3D\" library target using \"Urho3D_universal\" custom target. The problem is when performing a \"make install\". The install process is not configured to use this custom target. As the result, the Urho3D library being installed is not Mach-O universal binary but the lib is built only for iPhoneSimulator archs.\n\nThis problem is only being detected now as we now performing a new project scaffolding test with try_compile logic to verify if the library is good to go or

Sample Platformer has recently been trying to add D3D support.  https://github.com/gawag/Urho-Sample-Platformer/issues/15  Previously it only had OpenGL support.  Currently USP gets numerous log errors in D3D11Texture2D.cpp, with the following LOGERROR:\n\n```\n        // Create also a read-only version of the view for simultaneous depth testing and sampling in shader\n        depthStencilViewDesc.Flags = D3D11_DSV_READ_ONLY_DEPTH;\n        graphics_->GetImpl()->GetDevice()->CreateDepthStencilView((ID3D11Resource*)object_, &depthStencilViewDesc,\n            (ID3D11DepthStencilView**)&renderSurface_->readOnlyView_);\n\n        if (!renderSurface_->readOnlyView_)\n        {\n            URHO3D_LOGERROR(\"Failed to create read-only depth-stencil view for texture\");\n            return false;\n        }\n```\n\nCreateDepthStencilView, like most D3D functions, returns a HRESULT with some info on the nature of the failure.  It would be good to have this info incorporated into all the LOGERRORs.  Failing that, it would be good to have the function store the HRESULT in a variable, so it can be easily inspected with a debugger.  When someone is writing new code downstream of Urho3D, they have no idea if they did something wrong in their own code, or if something is broken in Urho3D itself.  Getting as much debug info as easily and readily available as possible, without having to manually edit the sources, helps diagnosis.\n\nIt might even make sense to create a type specific URHO3D_D3D_LOGERROR(hresult, \"string\") so as to uniformly enforce the convention and its implementation.\n\nI have verified that with the code as written, Visual Studio 2015 will not show the return value of CreateDepthStencilView in the debugger.  It shows all sorts of other intermediate return values, but the common denominator of those is, someone wants them for something else.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1092/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1091","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1091/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1091/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1091/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1091","id":121865360,"number":1091,"title":"build LuaJIT by default","user":{"login":"bvanevery","id":734930,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/734930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery","html_url":"https://github.com/bvanevery","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":301786971,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/build%20system","name":"build system","color":"5319e7","default":false},{"id":59038073,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/wontfix","name":"wontfix","color":"ffffff","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/6","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/6/labels","id":1933969,"number":6,"title":"1.6","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":444,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-08-10T03:15:59Z","updated_at":"2017-07-23T10:49:18Z","due_on":"2016-08-08T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-08-10T03:29:24Z"},"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-12-12T16:42:14Z","updated_at":"2016-08-10T03:25:10Z","closed_at":"2015-12-28T15:21:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The Samples are now built by default, which caused Lua to be built by default.

It promotes field testing of LuaJIT, which is more valuable on platforms such as Windows that don't get continuous integration testing.
