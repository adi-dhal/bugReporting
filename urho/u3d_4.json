I wrote function TransformNode2D(Vector2), it is simple helper function, which transforms Vector2 from node's local space to global space. It is used in two classes, and now I just declare it in one class and define in another. Where I should put it? I'm not sure, it doesn't looks so generic to put it in Node class.\r\n2. To load tile collision object group, I copy TileMapInfo2D structure into local var and set there custom width and height, based on current tile width and height. Besides it looks hackish, it will work wrong, if tile width is not multiple map's tile width. I see at least two ways how to fix this: a) Create another class, some kind of \"abstract objectgroup info\", which will delegate position conversion somewhere else, and b) just make width_ and height_ in TileMapInfo2D some floating-point type instead of int.
