further testing out the engine I noticed another issue with it - invisible system mouse cursor in MM_ABSOLUTE mode doesn't actually prevent the mouse from escaping the window.\n\n**Test machine:**\nAMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 3800+, NVIDIA GeForce 7600 GT (OpenGL 2.1.2) running on 64-bit Fedora 22 with propertiary NVIDIA 304.125 driver, Urho3D 1.4.\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nSet mouse mode to MM_ABSOLUTE, set mouse visibility to false, move the mouse aggressively until it escapes. (using tiny window makes it easier)\n**Workaround:**\nUse MM_RELATIVE mouse mode.\n**Proposed fix:**\nDeprecate SetMouseVisible() recommending the use of MM_RELATIVE instead, or use some under-the-hood magic not letting invisible cursor leave the window in MM_ABSOLUTE mode.\n\nOnce again, thanks for making and providing support for the engine!

just noticed in: http://urho3d.prophpbb.com/post7005.html#p7005 that the editor code doesn't take into account any defined viewports besides its own. And thus, creating new viewports, either to extend the editor's functionality or just to allow for game behaviour is not working as they get removed.\n\nThe responsible lines for this are in EditorView.as, function UpdateCameraPreview. Specifically: \n\n   // Remove extra viewport if it exists and no camera is selected\n    if (previewCamera.Get() is null)\n    {\n        if (renderer.numViewports > viewports.length)\n            renderer.numViewports = viewports.length;\n    }\n\nThere should be a mechanism for either the editor noticing user-created viewports or the user adding his viewports to the editor so it won't delete them.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/767","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/767/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/767/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/767/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/767","id":94003674,"number":767,"title":"No
