When I want to start my project EXE it says that it needs Data and CoreData folders. It's OK, create them. But it also needs all standard content placed there (shaders, UI etc.). How can I disable engine building with these files? I need only my assets which contain my shaders and layouts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1962","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1962/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1962/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1962/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1962","id":231835819,"number":1962,"title":"Fix RigidBody2D failure to apply transforms that would return it to o…","user":{"login":"ricab","id":6698114,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6698114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricab","html_url":"https://github.com/ricab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-05-27T23:56:08Z","updated_at":"2017-06-03T01:47:59Z","closed_at":"2017-06-02T22:31:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/pulls/1962","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1962","diff_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1962.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1962.patch"},"body":"…riginal position and rotation; fixes #1960","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1962/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1961","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1961/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1961/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1961/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1961","id":231833734,"number":1961,"title":"Node->LookAt as well as FromLookRotation reverse direction","user":{"login":"slapin","id":6099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin","html_url":"https://github.com/slapin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038073,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/wontfix","name":"wontfix","color":"ffffff","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":20,"created_at":"2017-05-27T23:05:26Z","updated_at":"2017-06-03T15:34:46Z","closed_at":"2017-06-03T15:33:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If one uses Node->LookAt() of quat.FromLookRotation() they find-out that both node and quat\r\nlook in reverse direction from what it was intended to. While operated in global coordinates,\r\nthis one might be really confusing. Found this while trying to rotate head and chest bone in direction of player.
