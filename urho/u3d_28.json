implements arbitrary vertex declaration support (issue #707), where you can decide the order, type and semantic of your vertex elements. This allows up to 4 UV coordinate sets.\n\nFor compatibility, you can still use the \"legacy\" vertex element masks when defining vertex buffers. The need to specify buffer binding element masks is eliminated altogether, rather if you want to override some elements with another buffer (for example positions from a morph vertex buffer) the override buffer simply has to use a higher index in Geometry or Graphics::SetVertexBuffers().\n\nMultiple input element semantics in vertex shaders are zero-based, e.g. iTexCoord would be the first (index 0) texcoord and iTexCoord1 would be second. D3D defines semantics explicitly but in GLSL it's based on string compare of the vertex attribute name.\n\nA new model format (UMD2) which uses vertex element declarations instead of element mask is introduced. AssetImporter will save using this format.\n\nTesting is appreciated. I'll still have to test morphs, which could have bugs yet, and whether Android / iOS / Emscripten works, but I'm opening this for early review in any case.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1320/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1319","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1319/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1319/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1319/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1319","id":147810084,"number":1319,"title":"Shader animation bug.","user":{"login":"neat3d","id":15573729,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15573729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neat3d","html_url":"https://github.com/neat3d","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neat3d/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neat3d/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neat3d/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neat3d/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neat3d/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neat3d/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neat3d/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neat3d/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neat3d/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/6","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/6/labels","id":1933969,"number":6,"title":"1.6","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":444,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-08-10T03:15:59Z","updated_at":"2017-07-23T10:49:18Z","due_on":"2016-08-08T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-08-10T03:29:24Z"},"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-04-12T16:44:41Z","updated_at":"2016-08-10T03:21:18Z","closed_at":"2016-04-12T18:07:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/pulls/1319","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1319","diff_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1319.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1319.patch"},"body":"Changed the conditions when unsubscribes the shader animation events.\nOr it will unsubcribe all the events if you call SetShaderParameterAnimation function twice.

Less code, does exactly the same. If there was good reason for two constructors to exist please let me know, ill be happy to fix PR in case this is unwanted change.\n\nNow it is possible to:\n\n```\nSubscribeToEvent(..., [&](StringHash type, VariantMap& args) {\n    // win\n});\n\nvoid Class::SomeEventHandler(StringHash type, VariantMap& args)\n{\n}\n\nSubscribeToEvent(..., std::bind(&Class::SomeEventHandler, this)));\n\nvoid Class::SomeOtherEventHandler(VariantMap& args)\n{\n}\n\nSubscribeToEvent(..., std::bind(&Class::SomeOtherEventHandler, this, _2)));\n```\n\nThere is an ugly workaround - `EventHandler` asserts that `receiver_` is not `0`. This is not relevant in case of c++11 as receiver is captured by `std::function<>` therefore i set `receiver_` to `0xDEADBEEF`. This should not cause any problems as long as person is aware of what he is doing and is not trying to get received from callback bound via c++11 methods. In case of a mistake it should quickly become clear that something is amiss due to very visual value of receiver pointer.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1301/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4640","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507250212","x-github-request-id":"DFCA:572D:1483DBF:31D492D:59D6C990","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/13266601/issues?state=all&page=29>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/13266601/issues?state=all&page=72>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/13266601/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/13266601/issues?state=all&page=27>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"af1113534f9433fe99c4f7d1a7afc423\"","status":"200 OK"}}
