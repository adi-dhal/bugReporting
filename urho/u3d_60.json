I am using opengl.  I am still very novice and don't understand how the shader compiler works.\n\nOn the LitSolid shader, the last #else condition seems to be inconsistent. \n\n```\n    #else\n        // Ambient & per-vertex lighting\n        vec3 finalColor = vVertexLight * diffColor.rgb;\n        #ifdef AO\n            // If using AO, the vertex light ambient is black, calculate occluded ambient here\n            finalColor += texture2D(sEmissiveMap, vTexCoord2).rgb * cAmbientColor * diffColor.rgb;\n        #endif\n\n        #ifdef MATERIAL\n            // Add light pre-pass accumulation result\n            // Lights are accumulated at half intensity. Bring back to full intensity now\n            vec4 lightInput = 2.0 * texture2DProj(sLightBuffer, vScreenPos);\n            vec3 lightSpecColor = lightInput.a * lightInput.rgb / max(GetIntensity(lightInput.rgb), 0.001);\n\n            finalColor += lightInput.rgb * diffColor.rgb + lightSpecColor * specColor;\n        #endif\n\n        #ifdef ENVCUBEMAP\n            finalColor += cMatEnvMapColor * textureCube(sEnvCubeMap, reflect(vReflectionVec, normal)).rgb;\n        #endif\n        #ifdef LIGHTMAP\n            finalColor += texture2D(sEmissiveMap, vTexCoord2).rgb * diffColor.rgb;\n        #endif\n        #ifdef EMISSIVEMAP\n            finalColor += cMatEmissiveColor * texture2D(sEmissiveMap, vTexCoord.xy).rgb;\n        #else\n            finalColor += cMatEmissiveColor;\n        #endif\n\n        gl_FragColor = vec4(GetFog(finalColor, fogFactor), diffColor.a);\n    #endif\n```\n\nThat whole section of conditions are never executed if you are on a forward renderer if there are any lights enabled.  If you disable the lights then that section works.  You can't have lights and use an AO material on the forward renderer.  You can on deferred mode.  If I were to guess what is happening, which is probably wrong, the PERPIXEL define is being defined on the 'base' pass on the forward renderer making it so the else is never hit.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/363","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/363/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/363/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/363/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/363","id":34320699,"number":363,"title":"Reload

unzipping from the source package, all the sub-directories are extracted as having file permission set to 700 (rwx------). On Linux platform, this would make the sub-directories only accessible by the file owner only, i.e. they are only accessible by user account who downloaded and extracted the package. This does not cause any problem for user to build Urho3D and run the shipped applications from the build tree.\n\nHowever, it will cause problem when user try to install Urho3D into a local file system. This is because current build scripts assume the file permissions in the source/build tree are correct to begin with. When they are already wrong, the corresponding file permissions in the installed destination will also be wrong as the result. i.e. they will be only accessible by root account.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/352/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/351","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/351/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/351/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/351/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/351","id":33578172,"number":351,"title":"UI Editor cannot display ListView content in Hierarchy view","user":{"login":"IndieDeveloper","id":7589721,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7589721?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IndieDeveloper","html_url":"https://github.com/IndieDeveloper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IndieDeveloper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IndieDeveloper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IndieDeveloper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IndieDeveloper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IndieDeveloper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IndieDeveloper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IndieDeveloper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IndieDeveloper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IndieDeveloper/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038072,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/question","name":"question","color":"cc317c","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/2/labels","id":593503,"number":2,"title":"1.32","description":null,"creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":278,"state":"closed","created_at":"2014-03-11T04:43:07Z","updated_at":"2015-07-16T05:18:08Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2014-11-28T04:55:53Z"},"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-05-15T11:49:29Z","updated_at":"2014-11-28T04:51:46Z","closed_at":"2014-05-16T07:50:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"1.
