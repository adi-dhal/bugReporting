PR is a small improvement of Urho's billboard system.\n\n**LookAt Y** and **Rotate Y** modes are useful for rendering some grounded objects like grass or trees that shouldn't be freely rotated. Such billboards degrade when camera looks downside and this case is often unwanted.\n\nThis PR introduces new mode called **LookAt Mixed** that is a hybrid of **LookAt XYZ** and **LookAt Y**. New attribute **minAngle** controls minimum angle between billboard normal and look-at direction. 0 is **LookAt Y** mode, 90 is **LookAt XYZ**. Small values of **minAngle** allow user to have almost-lookat-Y billboards that don't degrade when looking downside. See screenshot.\n\nUnfortunatelly, implementation for **Rotate Y**/**Rotate XYZ** looks much more difficult. But maybe it will be implemented at some point.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8576192/18288612/e29c4924-7484-11e6-9e2b-46fbe93fee40.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1568/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1567","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1567/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1567/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1567/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1567","id":175196589,"number":1567,"title":"Unnecessary shader compilation defines","user":{"login":"cadaver","id":51361,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/51361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver","html_url":"https://github.com/cadaver","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038070,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-09-06T09:06:46Z","updated_at":"2016-09-08T21:30:44Z","closed_at":"2016-09-08T21:30:44Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"As a result from the added feature of shader defines in material, these are going to be applied indiscriminately to shaders that don't need them.

Setting anisotropy samples to 8 or even more with 16 cause a massive framerate drops (more than 10 FPS drop) when the terrain is rendered on the screen. I guess that this is because the terrain is a big surface to process for the GPU. \n\nI have tried to force trilinear filtering on terrain texture and it solve the performance issue. Even if other meshes textures are anisotropic filtered there is only 2 FPS drop at worse.\n\nThe good thing would be to be able to set for example a maximum of 2 samples of anisotropic filtering on the terrain texture as trilinear filtering make the terrain quite blurry :)\n\nTested on DX11 desktop build with a Nvidia GTX 760.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1562","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1562/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1562/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1562/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1562","id":174890564,"number":1562,"title":"How to create Lua bindings in downstream project?","user":{"login":"KonstantinTomashevich","id":19854474,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/19854474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonstantinTomashevich","html_url":"https://github.com/KonstantinTomashevich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonstantinTomashevich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonstantinTomashevich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonstantinTomashevich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonstantinTomashevich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonstantinTomashevich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonstantinTomashevich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonstantinTomashevich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonstantinTomashevich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonstantinTomashevich/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038072,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/question","name":"question","color":"cc317c","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-09-03T10:31:44Z","updated_at":"2017-03-15T11:35:46Z","closed_at":"2016-09-03T14:34:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I want to write my game's core on C++ and my game's \"frontend\" on Lua.

think it's common in games that IntVector2 is used as a key in set or map.

Hope I understood the HashSet correctly and hope you agree with me :)\n\nAbout the hashing function. Why does it have two random numbers? Honestly, I don't know.
