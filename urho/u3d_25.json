Also, I add new sampe 44_RibbonTrailDemo to show you the effects. The commits are still messed up, I'll rebase them soon.\n\nFace camera Trail:\n![face_camera_trail](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5253453/15984497/92b5d1ae-2ff7-11e6-8d1f-113f0fff8c07.png)\n\nBone trail:\n![bone_trail](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5253453/15984499/953d8ffc-2ff7-11e6-9a4b-efa9c0a45aa6.png)\n\nAnyway, RibbonTrail icon for editor is still sucks, I'm not that good at pixel art.

place of NinjaSnowWar.as, which I hard-coded into the player, as it didn't work for me with the CommandLine.txt)\n- built with \"-std=gnu++14 -I/usr/include/boost\" for the CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS and \"-I/usr/include/boost\" for the CMAKE_C_FLAGS.\n- /usr/include/boost contains a symlink pointing to itself so that boost/preprocessor files can be found, without interfering the different emscripten system includes\n- Networking still doesn't work, so NinjaSnowWar shouldn't work\n- Debug builds did not work for me: see http://urho3d.prophpbb.com/topic2151.html\n- Defining FORCE_AS_PORTABLE can be used to force it to use the generic build with, for example, a gcc build (which should allow more apples-to-apples testing of the efficiency of the bindings) (I have not done such tests yet).\n-

been going through the issues to find some sort of way to get involve. Thought the VR integration describe in #153 looked super fun but I don't have an headset at this moment. What I've thought we could do is add LeapMotion which could be a cool thing to use inside the engine. Using it with VR brings out cool hack experience as I have seen on the leap motion hackathons. \nI'll be waiting for you guys to see what you've got to say about
