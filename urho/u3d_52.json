reconfiguring some projects to work with the new build installation, and in the process have found opportunity to try to clarify how I find include paths. So far, I've been hard-wiring include paths for lua.h and tolua++.h, but I was wondering if we should make those more readily available. I noticed that when doing a make install, the install script will copy some ThirdParty includes such as AngelScript, the physics libs and SDL. I think that in order to facilitate extension through Lua bindings, it might be a good idea to copy Lua headers as

an input lag that was especially noticable with vsync by switching from SDL_PeepEvents to SDL_PollEvent. Using OpenGL the lag is completely gone and with DirectX it's greatly reduced (and can be almost gone by setting max fps = refresh rate).\n\nNote that the OpenGL version uses SDL_GL_SetSwapInterval while the DirectX version uses D3DPRESENT_INTERVAL_ONE to enable VSync. I haven't looked into it but it could be that SDL_GL_SetSwapInterval does some internal stuff that fix the lag with the input polling when using VSync, unlike the DirectX version.\n\nAlso the only sagnificant difference between SDL_PeepEvents and SDL_PollEvent is that SDL_PeepEvents is thread safe, tho it shouldn't matter because the event polling isn't threaded.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/601/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/600","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/600/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/600/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/600/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/600","id":53965600,"number":600,"title":"removes

always sending the 3 smallest components the error when computing the fourth component is minimized.\nThe highest 2 bits are used to encode which of the 4 components was omitted.\nThe packed
