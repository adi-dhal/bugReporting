first I reported this in the forum asking whether it should be considered a bug or not. At the time, we came to the conclusion that it wasn't, the issue could be worked around easily (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/urho3d/VR4zomukD1M). But I've now noticed how the current implementation is limiting users.\n\nIn my game I use a custom parsing of the command line parameters to easily start the game in debug mode, skipping game menus and other things making it much easier to develop. The current method of adding resource paths to the engine is by specifying the -p parameter and define the different paths to be included within the same string, not as a proceeding value, e.g. \"-p/home/user/Workspace/Game\" instead of \"-p /home/user/Workspace/Game\". This causes problems for me now that I'm parsing a command line parameter called -players which specifies the amount of players I start the game with. When I do that the engine interprets it as I want to add the path \"layers\".\n\nThis can be solved by changing how the values are specified for the parameters on the command line. For my other command line parameters I simply select the next index of the arguments and I don't see why this can't be done for the engine?\n\ne.g.:\n\n``` cpp\n        Array<String>@ arguments = GetArguments();\n        bool skipNext = false;\n\n        for (uint i = 0; i < arguments.length; ++i)\n        {\n            if (skipNext)\n            {\n                skipNext = false;\n                continue;\n            }\n\n            String argument = arguments[i];\n\n            if (argument.StartsWith(\"-\"))\n            {\n                argument = argument.Substring(1).ToLower();\n\n                if (argument == \"address\" || argument == \"client\")\n                {\n                    this.network.SetMode(\"client\");\n\n                    if (arguments.length >= i+2)\n                    {\n                        this.network.serverAddress = arguments[i + 1].ToLower();\n                    }\n                    else\n                    {\n                        log.Warning(\"No server address has been specified for argument \\\"-\" + argument + \"\\\", selecting \\\"localhost\\\" as default\");\n                        this.network.serverAddress = \"localhost\";\n                    }\n                    skipNext = true;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/44/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/43","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/43/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/43/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/43/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/43","id":22429747,"number":43,"title":"It is too late to use LibRocket as UI system?","user":{"login":"shackra","id":1055216,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1055216?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shackra","html_url":"https://github.com/shackra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shackra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shackra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shackra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shackra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shackra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shackra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shackra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shackra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shackra/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038072,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/question","name":"question","color":"cc317c","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/1/labels","id":590529,"number":1,"title":"1.31","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":216,"state":"closed","created_at":"2014-03-07T14:42:58Z","updated_at":"2014-03-07T14:52:11Z","due_on":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2014-03-07T14:52:11Z"},"comments":6,"created_at":"2013-11-11T06:07:38Z","updated_at":"2014-03-07T14:48:07Z","closed_at":"2013-11-12T13:06:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I saw that this project implements its own ui system.
