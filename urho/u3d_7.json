That's OK at large sizes but leads to awkward letter spacing at small sizes.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to align characters horizontally at subpixel offsets, say 1/4 pixel offsets. I think that could be done by extending FontFace to cache up to 4 renderings of each glyph.\r\n\r\nThat would obviously use more memory, but it's only needed for small fonts, which don't take up much memory in the first place! So we could use an adaptive strategy -- single pixel alignment for large fonts, half-pixel for medium fonts, quarter-pixel for small fonts, etc.\r\n\r\nThis will become less important as high-resolution screens get more common, but many users still have low-res screens. As Urho aims to be a lightweight framework, it would be good to have high-quality text rendering by default on those low-end devices.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1952","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1952/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1952/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1952/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1952","id":231098039,"number":1952,"title":"FontFace should allow fractional font sizes","user":{"login":"iainmerrick","id":252111,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/252111?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iainmerrick","html_url":"https://github.com/iainmerrick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iainmerrick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iainmerrick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iainmerrick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iainmerrick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iainmerrick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iainmerrick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iainmerrick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iainmerrick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iainmerrick/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-05-24T16:25:20Z","updated_at":"2017-06-19T20:07:18Z","closed_at":"2017-06-19T20:07:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Currently the FontFace class only allows integral sizes (11pt, 12pt, etc).\r\n\r\nInternally, FontFaceFreeType multiplies the size by 64, so it looks like FreeType is capable of rendering fonts in steps of 1/64th of a point.
