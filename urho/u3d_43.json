The comments talk about \"desired\" side effects from doing this.  However it's creating at least 2 undesired side effects.  1) CMake builds are generally intended to allow so-called \"out of source\" builds where the source tree is left pristine.  This allows the CMake build master to delete the build directory and start over clean.  2) the dump messes up \"git pull\".  It complains about new local files that need to be resolved.  Both of these side effects are annoying.

using the Emscripten SDK, sourcing the `emsdk_env` script will get one into an Emscripten build environment. In this environment, there's a standard `EMSCRIPTEN` environment variable that points to the directory where `emcc` resides in. I notice when building that `cmake_emscripten.bat` was not able to find Emscripten directly via that. Perhaps if user doesn't set `-DEMSCRIPTEN_ROOT_PATH=x` in CMake command line, then the canonical `EMSCRIPTEN` environment variable could be searched?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/871/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/870","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/870/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/870/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/870/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/870","id":104530065,"number":870,"title":"Shader

Also I'm not sure if it's specific only to the guy that helped me test.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/867/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/866","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/866/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/866/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/866/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/866","id":103962602,"number":866,"title":"Compiling with Urho3D as library fails","user":{"login":"hjmediastudios","id":1511976,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1511976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjmediastudios","html_url":"https://github.com/hjmediastudios","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjmediastudios/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjmediastudios/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjmediastudios/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjmediastudios/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjmediastudios/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjmediastudios/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjmediastudios/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjmediastudios/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjmediastudios/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038071,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"e6e6e6","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/5/labels","id":1408188,"number":5,"title":"1.5","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":289,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-11-12T10:20:35Z","updated_at":"2015-11-18T08:30:55Z","due_on":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2015-11-12T10:47:52Z"},"comments":11,"created_at":"2015-08-30T23:19:53Z","updated_at":"2015-11-12T10:37:23Z","closed_at":"2015-09-07T15:44:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"My issues with using Urho3D as a library have popped back up again, as I'm suddenly getting the following messages when compiling with no project changes, just an Urho3D update from the latest revision.

some method of configuration to specify which textures for a shader technique's pass should be bound, defaulting to \"all\" and with an easy out of \"none.\"\n\n---\n\nI made a quick and dirty pass at adding a \"textures\" attribute to Technique passes to filter what textures should be bound for which passes.\n\nThe reasons for this were to avoid texture binding during shadow passes (or just bind the diffuse for alphamask techniques), specifically to compensate for integrated GPUs which have limited dedicated vram so unnecessary binds hurt more as the textures will realistically never be in vram.\n\nFrom the built in DX11 profiling in VS2013:\nGains for shadow rendering were 15% on Intel HD4000 & HD4400 (smidge higher results), going down to around 8-10% for just binding diffuse for alphamask. For 3 4096x4096 textures, results were lesser on smaller sizes.\n\nI'm not sure my implementation is great enough to warrant a PR however, it's basically just passing a PODVector<TextureUnit> from the pass by pointer to batch drawing, if null then bind everything (a magic \"all\" was checked for first), if not null check size for whether to bind anything and if size is > 0 check the contents for what to bind.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/859/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/858","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/858/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/858/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/858/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/858","id":103330079,"number":858,"title":"fix-m-typing","user":{"login":"MonkeyFirst","id":9577466,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/9577466?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeyFirst","html_url":"https://github.com/MonkeyFirst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeyFirst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeyFirst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeyFirst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeyFirst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeyFirst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeyFirst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeyFirst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeyFirst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonkeyFirst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/5/labels","id":1408188,"number":5,"title":"1.5","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":289,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-11-12T10:20:35Z","updated_at":"2015-11-18T08:30:55Z","due_on":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2015-11-12T10:47:52Z"},"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-08-26T17:55:00Z","updated_at":"2015-11-12T10:28:22Z","closed_at":"2015-08-27T06:46:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/pulls/858","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/858","diff_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/858.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/858.patch"},"body":"little

If you try to read it back using GetUInt() the method returns 0.\n\nI understand why this is (Lua only knows about doubles) but it's still kind of inconvenient and bug prone.\n\nWhat about a change to the various GetDouble, GetFloat, GetInt, GetUInt methods of Variant that will perform appropriate casting as needed? ie, a Variant can be set to a VAR_DOUBLE type, but calling GetUInt() on it will perform a cast on the stored double value and return the casted value, rather than defaulting to returning 0 because it's not the right type?\n\nI know this really isn't an optimal solution either (prone to all the possible errors that can be introduced from casting between types of different bit sizes) but it might be better than the current default of returning 0.\n\nWhat think you all?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/851/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4625","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507250212","x-github-request-id":"9FA2:01FC:10933F8:2B35A4C:59D6C9CB","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/13266601/issues?state=all&page=44>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/13266601/issues?state=all&page=72>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/13266601/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/13266601/issues?state=all&page=42>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"56e27c4d708a52edab9755d66423e910\"","status":"200 OK"}}
