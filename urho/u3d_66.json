the refactor of pingponging code, RTTs stopped to work when they use a renderpath which needs pingponging (tested with OpenGL, I don't know for DirectX).\n\nFor a simple way to reproduce, juste modify RenderToTexture.cpp sample line 198 to append to the render path a postprocess which reads & writes the viewport, for example :\n\n``` cpp\n            RenderSurface* surface = renderTexture->GetRenderSurface();\n            RenderPath* renderpath = new RenderPath();\n            renderpath->Load(GetSubsystem<ResourceCache>()->GetResource<XMLFile>(\"RenderPaths/Forward.xml\"));\n            renderpath->Append(GetSubsystem<ResourceCache>()->GetResource<XMLFile>(\"PostProcess/EdgeFilter.xml\"));\n            SharedPtr<Viewport> rttViewport(new Viewport(context_, rttScene_, rttCameraNode_->GetComponent<Camera>(), renderpath));\n            surface->SetViewport(0, rttViewport);\n```\n\nThen launch the sample, the RTT texture will remain black instead of showing rotating boxes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/166/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/165","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/165/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/165/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/165/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/165","id":26736577,"number":165,"title":"Airplanes
