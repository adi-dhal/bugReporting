Although I have successfully built the library from source, I'm using the latest Windows static lib release in a new Visual Studio Project. So far, I've gotten nothing but linking errors (LNK2018 Unresolved external). The code I'm using is this:\n\n``` C++\n#include \"stdafx.h\"\n#include \"Engine.h\"\n#include \"Ptr.h\"\n\nint _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[])\n{\n    Urho3D::SharedPtr<Urho3D::Engine> engine;\n    Urho3D::Context* context;\n    engine = new Urho3D::Engine(context);\n    engine->Exit();\n    return -1;\n}\n```\n\nIs this correct? If I simply link/include the static lib and add the include directly to my new VS2012 project, should I be able to run the engine? Or am I missing something.\n\nI know platform specific building questions are a bit frustrating, but any help would be most
