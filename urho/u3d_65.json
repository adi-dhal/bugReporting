added orthographic support to the editor and switch the mouse wheel to use zoom instead of moving the camera.  The zoom works well in both perspective and orthographic modes.  To toggle the camera mode press numpad 5.  I also added a little status bar at the bottom of every viewport to show the position and zoom of the camera.  The plan is to switch position to text boxes, add rotation, add a reset button, and a toggle for othographic, and presets for front/side/top.  If you would like to hold on until I finish those things that perfectly fine by me.\n\nThanks :heart:
