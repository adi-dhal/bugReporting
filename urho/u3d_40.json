PR shows how to get rid of the `defined_` boolean in `BoundingBox` class, and instead use `min = INF` and `max = -INF` denote the case when a bounding box is degenerate. This helps reduce branching and SSE'ifying BoundingBox. Using this scheme, it might be possible to further reduce `if (box.Defined())` checks in the codebase, since given how the math falls out, such arithmetic can naturally yield a desired negative result (no hit, outside, etc.) depending on the case.\n\nAlso SSE optimizes some hot BoundingBox functions and adds dummy padding floats to `BoundingBox` structure to help SSE loads and stores, which seems safe to do here.\n\nThere is also a small (pedantic) logic fix for `BoundingBox::Define(const Vector3* vertices, unsigned count)` when `count == 0`, which should probably define a degenerate box, instead of keeping the old one around(?).\n\nThe performance improvement here is rather small, about 3% on the 10k Jacks scene, and this carries an API change that extends to the scripting languages, so it is understandable if there is a concern merging this.\n\nIf this looks interesting, I noticed that classes `Rect` and `Sphere` also use such a `defined_` scheme, which could be removed using the same techniques.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/948","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/948/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/948/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/948/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/948","id":111060063,"number":948,"title":"allow_enable_sse_on_emscripten","user":{"login":"juj","id":225351,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/225351?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj","html_url":"https://github.com/juj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038070,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/5/labels","id":1408188,"number":5,"title":"1.5","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":289,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-11-12T10:20:35Z","updated_at":"2015-11-18T08:30:55Z","due_on":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2015-11-12T10:47:52Z"},"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-10-12T21:31:13Z","updated_at":"2015-11-12T10:30:38Z","closed_at":"2015-10-13T01:35:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/pulls/948","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/948","diff_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/948.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/948.patch"},"body":"Enable
