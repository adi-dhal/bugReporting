This change also seems to have the effect that in scalar version, VS2015 did not dare to inline Matrix3x4 multiplication in AnimatedModel::UpdateSkinning(), but after SSE, the instruction count is small enough that it happily does so.\n\nThe code uses explicit unaligned loads and stores as opposed to aligned loads, so that memory layout does not need to change.\n\nOnly tested on 06_SkeletalAnimation sample, which uses  `Matrix3x4 operator *(const Matrix3x4& rhs)`.

a native Win64 build of `06_SkeletalAnimation` in AMD CodeXL, with the modification that the scene consists of 2000 animated Jack models, the profile looks slightly

What is the listener mechanism used there for? Skinning <-> Scene node interaction? or Skinning <-> Bullet interaction? Or something related? Are weak pointers necessary?\n\n(Sidenote: how large can one expect the `listeners_` array to grow? The `listeners_.Erase(i);` behavior in this function has a O(n^2) complexity when erased in this manner, since `Erase()` shifts all elements back by one, i.e. calling `MoveRange`. although in the captured profile, that does not seem to be an issue here. Using the swap-with-last-element-and-erase-last trick could be used to avoid the quadratic complexity if the order of elements in `listeners_` is not important)\n\nIn the `12_PhysicsStressTest` sample with 3000 boxes, the `Node::MarkDirty()` function does show up in the profile as well. Some mitigating strategies if the performance is a concern:\n- prefetch the weak pointers in the iteration (if `listeners_` is long)\n- pool the weak pointer control blocks and/or listener objects\n- implement `Node::MarkDirty()` as iterative instead of recursive, since some time (10% in the profile) is spent in recursively calling child nodes\n- remove the weak pointer dependency and make it a strong ref dependency, synchonously/imperatively maintaining pointer removals on both sides of the link?\n\nNot sure if this is a hotspot in any real world scenes, it is possible that 2000 Jacks is just a contrived scenario (feel free to close if so!), but when looking to replace 10kCubes with 10kJacks... ;)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/931/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/930","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/930/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/930/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/930/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/930","id":110546855,"number":930,"title":"Bullet 2.83.6","user":{"login":"juj","id":225351,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/225351?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj","html_url":"https://github.com/juj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038070,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/5/labels","id":1408188,"number":5,"title":"1.5","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":289,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-11-12T10:20:35Z","updated_at":"2015-11-18T08:30:55Z","due_on":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2015-11-12T10:47:52Z"},"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-10-08T21:41:23Z","updated_at":"2015-11-12T10:30:45Z","closed_at":"2015-10-09T12:53:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/pulls/930","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/930","diff_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/930.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/930.patch"},"body":"This resolves #929.\n\nCherry-picked the changes from git history to Bullet.

For small Urho3D demos that don't have any audio, this can be a bit confusing if a user is visiting a Urho3D page, and assumes there should some audio since the icon is showing up, but nothing is heard. I wonder if it would make sense to open up the audio device only on demand, e.g. when the playback of first audio clip is started, or some other appropriate spot?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/924/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/923","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/923/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/923/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/923/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/923","id":109845487,"number":923,"title":"Add

several samples built for Emscripten, the mouse behavior is a bit quirky. \n\nWhat currently happens:\n    - mouse cursor is hidden when mouse is moved over the canvas.\n    - mouse cursor is restored to be visible again when mouse exits the canvas.\n    - moving the mouse over the canvas generates camera mouselook rotate events.\n    - moving the mouse outside the canvas does not rotate the camera.\n    - mouse cursor is not constrained to stay inside the canvas rectangle, but the mouse cursor is able to freely exit the canvas rectangle.\n    - when mouse enters/exits the canvas rectangle, there is an abrupt \"discontinuous\" snap of the camera lookat direction.\n\nThe combination of these behaviors makes looking around the scene by rotating the camera with mouse move a bit difficult, and one can't easily do e.g. a 360 rotation of the . In fullscreen mode, this problem does not occur since the mouse cursor is not able to exit the canvas.\n\nIn the 08_decals sample, there is an additional issue that the software mouse cursor rendered by the engine does not match with the location of the actual mouse cursor.\n\nIf I might suggest, some ways to come out of the issues:\n- remove the behavior of hiding the mouse cursor by default and moving the camera by default, and make it e.g. a \"hold down right mouse button to drag\" type of gesture.\n- In 08_decals sample, one could avoid hiding the mouse cursor over the canvas, but instead let the real mouse cursor stay visible, and not render a software mouse cursor in Urho3D. Then use absolute mouse cursor positions provided by the input api to mark the mouse cursor location instead of calculating them incrementally/relative inside the engine.\n- an alternative could be to use the pointer lock api (`emscripten_request_pointerlock()`) when the user clicks on the canvas. Pointer lock hides the mouse cursor on the web page altogether, and changes it to a relative movement mode.

That function only has millisecond precision, and it is not optimized for high performance tasks, so there is a asm.js <-> non-asm.js boundary transition which impacts performance.\n\nIt is difficult to optimize `gettimeofday()` in Emscripten side, since we must return the current time of day, and can't return an arbitrary wallclock time. High-precision timers don't actually care about the time of day, so in Emscripten, for fastest and most precise high performance wallclock timing, it is advisable to use the `double emscripten_get_now();` function, which returns a wallclock time in milliseconds  with submillisecond precision. It is practically a call to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/now .\n\nTherefore the implementation of `HiresTimer::GetUSec()` could be\n\n```\n#ifdef __EMSCRIPTEN__ // +\n#include <emscripten/emscripten.h> // +\n#endif // +\n\nlong long HiresTimer::GetUSec(bool reset)\n{\n    long long currentTime;\n\n#ifdef WIN32\n    if (supported)\n    {\n        LARGE_INTEGER counter;\n        QueryPerformanceCounter(&counter);\n        currentTime = counter.QuadPart;\n    }\n    else\n        currentTime = timeGetTime();\n#elif defined(__EMSCRIPTEN__) // +\n    currentTime = (long long)(emscripten_get_now() * 1000.0); // +\n#else\n    struct timeval time;\n    gettimeofday(&time, NULL);\n    currentTime = time.tv_sec * 1000000LL + time.tv_usec;\n#endif\n\n    long long elapsedTime = currentTime - startTime_;\n\n    // Correct for possible weirdness with changing internal frequency\n    if (elapsedTime < 0)\n        elapsedTime = 0;\n\n    if (reset)\n        startTime_ = currentTime;\n\n    return (elapsedTime * 1000000LL) / frequency;\n}\n```\n\nlines marked with (+) were added.\n\nAs a sidenote, I see that the file Timer.cpp actually repeats the implementation of obtaining a wallclock time five times almost identically in the following functions\n\n```\nunsigned Time::GetSystemTime()\nunsigned Timer::GetMSec(bool reset)\nvoid Timer::Reset()\nlong long HiresTimer::GetUSec(bool reset)\nvoid HiresTimer::Reset()\n```\n\nwhich each call to `gettimeofday()`. The note to use the Emscripten-specific `emscripten_get_now()` instead of `gettimeofday()` would apply to each of these, since none of the functions seem like they need the actual time of day.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/916/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/915","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/915/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/915/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/915/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/915","id":109713462,"number":915,"title":"Frame limiter logic would be better deferred to the browser in Emscripten builds.","user":{"login":"juj","id":225351,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/225351?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj","html_url":"https://github.com/juj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038070,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/5/labels","id":1408188,"number":5,"title":"1.5","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":289,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-11-12T10:20:35Z","updated_at":"2015-11-18T08:30:55Z","due_on":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2015-11-12T10:47:52Z"},"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-10-04T23:43:30Z","updated_at":"2015-11-12T10:36:44Z","closed_at":"2015-10-05T16:30:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looking at a profile of 27_Urho2DPhysics sample, the call to `usleep` function pops up taking 12.2% of total execution time, which is called from `Urho3D::Time::Sleep()`, coming from `Urho3D::Engine::ApplyFrameLimit()`. In browsers, JavaScript code does not have a possibility to run synchronous sleeps themselves, since JS code runs in the same thread than the main browser operates, and such sleeps would block/lock up the browser page DOM/UI for the duration of the sleep. In order to sleep, the code should yield back to the browser. \n\nUrho3D uses already the `emscripten_set_main_loop_arg()` function to set up the main loop, so the code gets ticks called at 60Hz, or 120Hz, or whichever the native refresh rate of the display is. It sounds like the frame limiter logic could just #ifdeffed out from Emscripten builds since the browser is already limiting the execution rate anyways?\n\n(btw, in the experimental pthreads-capable builds of Emscripten, Emscripten is gaining the support for synchronously sleeping without busy spin-waiting, but that makes sense only in Emscripten `--proxy-to-worker` builds, which are a bit experimental at this

looks for DirectX redistributables.  It searches some registry paths to locate Windows Kits / SDKs:\n\nfind_file (DIRECT3D_DLL NAMES ${DLL_NAMES} PATHS\n    \"[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v8.1;InstallationFolder]/Redist/D3D/${PATH_SUFFIX}\"\n    \"[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v8.0;InstallationFolder]/Redist/D3D/${PATH_SUFFIX}\"\n    NO_DEFAULT_PATH)\n\nHowever on one of my Windows 10 machines, that started life as a Vista machine and went through a few generations of upgrades of OS and Visual Studio compilers, I have far more than just these 2 kits.  It's got v10.0, v8.1A, v8.1, v8.0A, v8.0, and v7.1A.  They've all got the same path structure, just need more paths.  I would suggest highest number first. \n\nI have also found v10.0A and v7.0A directories for some binaries, but these aren't listed in the Wow6432Node as part of the SDKs.  Could be a version \"gotcha\", if directories exist somewhere that don't actually correspond to SDKs.  Just saying, a proper search would have to be careful.\n\nTechnically a build should match the Kit actually chosen for the build.  A CMake user has a choice of generators and could have multiple compiler installations living side by side, with different Kits for each.  If such Kits are not being detected though, then figuring this out could get dicey and complicated. I'm not up on CMake methods for detecting \"the Kit in use\".\n\n I'm not even sure if these redistributables are actually different from Kit to Kit.  Haven't checked that.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/911/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4627","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507250212","x-github-request-id":"C96A:572C:16767BF:2C9CA9B:59D6C9C3","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/13266601/issues?state=all&page=42>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/13266601/issues?state=all&page=72>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/13266601/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/13266601/issues?state=all&page=40>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"093294358b4f299aa41d6608fc9315ed\"","status":"200 OK"}}
