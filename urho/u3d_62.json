not merge just yet.  This is still a work in progress.\n\nI have added via brute force a mechanism which scans each file in the resourceDirs.  It checks the binary signature/xml root if it can and falls back to file extensions for some meaningful cases.  It is honestly really hard to account for every possibility the browser can handle.  I would like some opinions on how it can be improved without having to change too much about it.  I would also understand if this is rejected because of code impact.\n\nThe resource browser items can be dragged into the hierarchy in many cases.  I chose to not instance a node to put components in.  These things are naturally to debate.  You can drag prefabs and materials into the viewport.  You can right click on both the hierarchy and browser items to get a context menu.  There are lots of missing integrations I am sure.\n\nPotential Issues\n- The file scanning can produce errors.  A mechanism for silencing logs would be useful during scanning.\n\nKnown Bugs\n- Opacity of the file list isn't the right color.\n- The drag cursor isn't right for dragging file items into the viewport.\n- Kinda Ugly.\n\nI will do a pass to fix the issues with the coding guidelines.  I would like to get opinions on this beast and get it up to snuff!  When I worked in master I missed the browser.  Hopefully others will like it.\n\n:heart: :heart:

So if we take the \"hit\" now, we'll end up with a more consistent API and have less typing for the common case (camera or character moving relative to its local coordinate axes)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/295","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/295/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/295/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/295/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/295","id":30754202,"number":295,"title":"will the class Node provide api like as SetRotationPivot , SetScalePivot?","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038070,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/2/labels","id":593503,"number":2,"title":"1.32","description":null,"creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":278,"state":"closed","created_at":"2014-03-11T04:43:07Z","updated_at":"2015-07-16T05:18:08Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2014-11-28T04:55:53Z"},"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-04-03T08:09:53Z","updated_at":"2014-11-28T04:51:18Z","closed_at":"2014-04-05T14:07:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\nThis issue is discussing in forum, http://urho3d.prophpbb.com/topic169.html, I think this is very useful and common for game developing, cause I need it right now.\nI need rotate a car around it head, and around it rear after a while, the pivot is dynamic, so it can't be specified from 3d model builder or using orbiting.\nWill you add this api  or is there any way to achieve this purpose?

implemented new functionality in editor which allows to spray prefabs saved by \"save node\" option. This is very useful if somebody would like to create large number of objects (lets say grass, trees) on the surface.\nThere are some parameters which modify each object randomly like random rotation on each axis and random scale. Also there is option to orient the spawned nodes by surface normal which is enabled by default.\nThe tool can be also precise when you set spawning area to 0 and count to 1 which will create object exactly under mouse cursor.\nNew window can also spawn multiple objects randomly to make a better result. Lets say you are spawning 5 different types of trees so it look more natural. You can also pick the same object many times to increase probability of spawning that object.\n\nThe surface which we are spawning at can be determined by graphical objects or physics objects, you can switch between them by choosing picking type of objects CTRL+6.\nSpawn window can be enabled in View tab.\n\n![spawn](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2963404/2591720/5b3599cc-ba6e-11e3-9037-79fadaff8392.png)\n![spawn2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2963404/2591721/5b3a12c2-ba6e-11e3-9099-e2a48752cf87.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/291","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/291/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/291/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/291/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/291","id":30457572,"number":291,"title":"Zone ambient color glitches","user":{"login":"friesencr","id":105460,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/105460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr","html_url":"https://github.com/friesencr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038071,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"e6e6e6","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/2/labels","id":593503,"number":2,"title":"1.32","description":null,"creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":278,"state":"closed","created_at":"2014-03-11T04:43:07Z","updated_at":"2015-07-16T05:18:08Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2014-11-28T04:55:53Z"},"comments":5,"created_at":"2014-03-30T02:25:02Z","updated_at":"2014-11-28T04:50:55Z","closed_at":"2014-04-03T03:55:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I am getting some issues where zone ambient color is acting strangely.

 hitNode:Remove()\nby:\n    hitNode.position = hitNode.position + Vector3(10, 0, 0)\n\nNow create a mushroom using middle mouse button:\n- if mushroom moves inside the same tile, everything is OK (initial position and new position are rebuilt)\n- if mushroom moves from one tile to another one, initial position is rebuilt, but new position is not.\n\nTo fix this we can add a second rebuild for new position, something like:\n    navMesh:Build(updateBox) -- Update origin tile\n    navMesh:Build(hitDrawable.worldBoundingBox) -- Update destination tile\n\nI think this should not be done in
