It is not exactly necessary, but i did it for the sake of completeness.\r\n\r\n`IntRect` now holds data in two `BaseVector2<T>` vectors `min_` and `max_`, just like `Rect`. Structs and unions were added to give access to `left_`, `top_`, `right_` and `bottom_` to both `Rect` and `IntRect`. `Rect` also gained `Width()` and `Height()` methods that were originally present only in `IntRect`.\r\n\r\nAll of these classes were provided with explicit template constructor that defines object from an array of arithmetic types.\r\n\r\nNow these types share common code base and are of similar layout. It was very awkward to work in cases where `Rect` and `IntRect` were mixed, because of their differences in storing values. It was no less awkward to find yourself in need of a certain operator in `IntVector3` only to realize it is missing, while it is defined in `Vector3`. Now defining operator for base type will provide it to all specializations of that type. And as a bonus user can easily define his own versions of vectors that fit perfectly with the engine. `Int64Vector3` now can be a reality.\r\n\r\nI also tested every example, including native, angelscript and lua and editor as well. Editor could use some extra testing though. I did look for features that `Int*` classes had and their `float`-based counterparts did not, but it is possible i missed something.\r\n\r\nAnd that is about it. Lets hope CI will be happy 🤞

Moving middle mouse button for orbiting around look-at and right button movement for orbiting around camera itself (For standard Hotkey).\r\n\r\n7. Some camera related code cleanup.\r\n\r\n8.
