When having many CollisionShapes in a single node, these add up to a ridiculous amount of resource waste and an unusably slow update speed.\n\nThe CollisionShape::Set_() methods always cause a call to RigidBody::UpdateMass() which is a very heavy operation causing the RigidBody to recreate the Bullet compound shape out of all the currently existing CollisionShapes, only to be called soon again when the next CollisionShape::Set_() is called.\n\nI didn't see this described anywhere, but by looking at the source code long enough, I found that doing this efficiently is possible via this quite unintuitive way:\n\nFirst of all, I think it is possible to just remove the RigidBody and create it again after creating and/or updating the CollisionShapes, but then you lose all the properties set in the RigidBody in addition to causing an unnecessary network update (if using networking) and so on. But then...\n\nIt is possible to call RigidBody::ReleaseBody() before managing the CollisionShapes. This takes advantage of the fact that if RigidBody::body_==NULL, UpdateMass() does nothing. After updating all the CollisionShapes, RigidBody::OnSetEnabled() can be called to cause a call to the private RigidBody::AddBodyToWorld(), which will create the RigidBody::body_ and it also calls stuff like RigidBody::UpdateMass(), making everything directly work again very efficiently.\n\nI couldn't find a better place to post this. Hopefully this will end up helping someone.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/489/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/488","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/488/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/488/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/488/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/488","id":45629314,"number":488,"title":"Fix Variant:SetBuffer and VariantMap:SetBuffer in Lua","user":{"login":"celeron55","id":115571,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/115571?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/celeron55","html_url":"https://github.com/celeron55","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celeron55/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celeron55/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celeron55/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celeron55/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celeron55/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celeron55/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celeron55/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celeron55/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celeron55/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/2/labels","id":593503,"number":2,"title":"1.32","description":null,"creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":278,"state":"closed","created_at":"2014-03-11T04:43:07Z","updated_at":"2015-07-16T05:18:08Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2014-11-28T04:55:53Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-10-13T10:39:53Z","updated_at":"2014-11-28T04:48:43Z","closed_at":"2014-10-13T11:54:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/pulls/488","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/488","diff_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/488.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/488.patch"},"body":"Without this fix, any data starting with 0 will be copied as being zero length, and I guess it might segfault if there are no null bytes in the data.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/488/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/487","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/487/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/487/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/487/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/487","id":45604437,"number":487,"title":"Connection::SyncPackages method.

Inspecting the generated UILuaAPI.cpp definition for tolua_set_Text3D_faceCameraMode shows that tolua is generating code as if FaceCameraMode were a class or struct type rather than an enum. You can see the difference by inspecting the generated tolua_set_Text3D_textEffect function, where the type from the top of the Lua stack is cast to a number using tolua_tonumber before being passed to the object method, ie:\n\nself->SetTextEffect(((TextEffect) (int)  tolua_tonumber(tolua_S,2,0))\n\n whereas the faceCameraMode function casts the stack value to a pointer of type *FaceCameraMode, then derefs that pointer and passes the value at the dereferenced location to SetFaceCameraMode:\n\nself->SetFaceCameraMode(_((FaceCameraMode_)  tolua_tousertype(tolua_S,2,0))\n\nClearly, this is undesirable behavior. I believe that the difference lies in the fact that the textEffect enum is bound to Lua within the UILua library, whereas the FaceCameraMode enum is bound within the GraphicsLua library. It is possible that at the point that UILuaAPI.cpp is generated, tolua only sees the name FaceCameraMode without context and assumes that FaceCameraMode is a class/struct rather than an enum.\n\nAdding the FaceCameraMode enum definition to the top of Text3D.pkg solves the issue; however, I am unsure if duplicating an enum in 2 places in the bindings is really the best solution.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/484/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/483","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/483/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/483/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/483/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/483","id":45455345,"number":483,"title":"node.Remove() sometimes crashes the engine","user":{"login":"szamq","id":2963404,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2963404?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szamq","html_url":"https://github.com/szamq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szamq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szamq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szamq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szamq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szamq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szamq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szamq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szamq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szamq/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/2/labels","id":593503,"number":2,"title":"1.32","description":null,"creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":278,"state":"closed","created_at":"2014-03-11T04:43:07Z","updated_at":"2015-07-16T05:18:08Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2014-11-28T04:55:53Z"},"comments":7,"created_at":"2014-10-10T08:03:24Z","updated_at":"2014-11-28T04:54:43Z","closed_at":"2014-10-10T09:57:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Win 7 64bit, opengl, deferred renderer, 32 bit build. Source updated to recent. Angel script.\n\nI am creating the ragdoll in the way similar to Ragdolls sample. After the ragdoll is created I want to remove the ragdoll after some time (let's say 5 seconds). So I'm creating ScriptInstance which calls node.Remove() after some time - the same way as in NinjaSnowWar GameObject duration.\n\nI have some random crash about 1 crash per 3 ragdolls, so quite often. Crash dump is generated and the logs doesn't show anything. Crash dump tells that \"thread wanted to read virtual address without appropriate access\"\n\nAdditionally, the crash doesn't happen in Remove() method, when I replace node.Remove() by\n\n```\n        Print(\"before\");\n        node.Remove();\n        Print(\"after\");\n```\n\nthen I can see that the word \"after\" is the last word in the log.\n\nI understand that the bug might be difficult to locate. Here is the node structure I try to Remove(saved after ragdoll creation, but before deletion, crash also happens in editor). The script instance is custom script which removes own node after some time and the Remove() is the last instruction.\n\nBtw. when I switch node.Remove() to node.SetEnabledRecursive(false) the crash doesn't happen, so I will use that for now. How efficient is disabling node and all children instead removing the node?\n\nMoreover, when I don't create the rigidbodies and constraints for ragdoll, then there is no crash too.\nHere is the node

This is what I see in the preliminary assessment.\n1. ~~Mac OSX 10.8 SDK has been removed. Impact: OSX build for deployment target 10.8 is now not possible on Travis CI. Proposed solution: a) bump the deployment target to 10.9 or b) try to install 10.8 SDK first before building.~~\n2. AppleClang 6.0 produces too many warnings in the output. Impact: iOS 64-bit build gets terminated by Travis CI as it generates log file bigger than their threshold (4 MB). Proposed solution: a) exclude test building the Mach-O universal binary (again) to cut down the log generated or b) bite the bullet to do something on those warnings.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/476","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/476/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/476/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/476/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/476","id":44556647,"number":476,"title":"Upload

I'm hoping someone knowledgeable about these things could look into it.\n- It's probably possible to overflow/overrun the constructor String(float). Looking here: [Link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1701055/what-is-the-maximum-length-in-chars-needed-to-represent-any-double-value), floats can have 154 characters and doubles (which aren't in urho yet) could have 1078 -- the current conversion buffer is 128.\n- If I wanted to expose sprintf format string (eg: String(float, formatString) ), it would likely be susceptible to format string exploits. [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncontrolled_format_string)\n- Simply adding 0 to ensure null character end might split UTF8 character (and also doesn't prevent overrun).\n\nA safe version of sprintf/snprintf would be good (or extend AppendWithFormatArgs?).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/472/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/471","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/471/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/471/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/471/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/471","id":44255055,"number":471,"title":"Allow to set prevent change of modal attribute when ESC key pressed in modal window.","user":{"login":"VladimirPobedinskiy","id":198486,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/198486?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladimirPobedinskiy","html_url":"https://github.com/VladimirPobedinskiy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladimirPobedinskiy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladimirPobedinskiy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladimirPobedinskiy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladimirPobedinskiy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladimirPobedinskiy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladimirPobedinskiy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladimirPobedinskiy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladimirPobedinskiy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VladimirPobedinskiy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038070,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/2/labels","id":593503,"number":2,"title":"1.32","description":null,"creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":278,"state":"closed","created_at":"2014-03-11T04:43:07Z","updated_at":"2015-07-16T05:18:08Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2014-11-28T04:55:53Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-09-29T03:48:37Z","updated_at":"2014-11-28T04:53:06Z","closed_at":"2014-09-29T20:06:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think what need to allow user to prevent change modal attribute of window when ESC key pressed. \nI need show wait window and user must wait complete of some operation, but now user can press ESC and hide this window.
