I've just remarked that icons alpha transparency \"work\", but is not doing it smoothly. As it was \"clipped\" when there should be a gradation of transparency.\n\nI've found the original PNG image and put a dark background to compare it to the icons in the runtime of the editor. If you look inside Photoshop, the icons borders are smooth, but they are not in the editor (pixelated borders). I think it's related on how the alpha channel is processed. Right now it's seem to clip (0/1) when it should put a transparency value of the alpha (0/255).\n\nYou might have to zoom in to view the difference...\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13395943/8897799/7007c294-33e9-11e5-997f-c5953bfd6894.jpg)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/798","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/798/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/798/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/798/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/798","id":97353534,"number":798,"title":"Expanded

As @friesencr just pointed out, this issue only applies to Lua, as AngelScript has already a built-in better mechanism\n\nI think the engine would benefit from separating the \"Script\" subsystem and the registration of the Urho3D functions. If we abstract the common behaviour from Script in a Base class (execute function, load file, ...) and then do the registration in a derived class the programmer can derive the base class with his own separate Script API sandboxed for mods. \n\nThat way the programmer can instantiate both subsystems at the same time, one to run the game (if he choses to program the game with one of the Scripting languages) and another one to manage his custom mod API, which can be at a higher level of abstraction than the Urho engine.\n\nWhat do you think of this refactor?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/791","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/791/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/791/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/791/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/791","id":96501195,"number":791,"title":"StaticModelGroup don't work when used Techniques/DiffAlphaMask.xml","user":{"login":"1vanK","id":13021826,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13021826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK","html_url":"https://github.com/1vanK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038073,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/wontfix","name":"wontfix","color":"ffffff","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/5/labels","id":1408188,"number":5,"title":"1.5","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":289,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-11-12T10:20:35Z","updated_at":"2015-11-18T08:30:55Z","due_on":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2015-11-12T10:47:52Z"},"comments":9,"created_at":"2015-07-22T07:58:23Z","updated_at":"2015-11-12T10:38:15Z","closed_at":"2015-07-22T17:48:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/791/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4623","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507250212","x-github-request-id":"C99A:572C:1676E54:2C9D61C:59D6C9D3","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/13266601/issues?state=all&page=46>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/13266601/issues?state=all&page=72>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/13266601/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/13266601/issues?state=all&page=44>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"40b9b52251be6c068214f8d32ba97890\"","status":"200 OK"}}
