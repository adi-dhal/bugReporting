Bullet has to process a lot of collisions making even the most simple scenes unplayable with modern hardware. I solved the issue by using an invisible terrain on top of the detailed one with a smaller 65x65 texture, but this is nothing more than a workaround for what I think it's a missing feature in terrain CollisionShape.\n\nYou can check my post on the forum for a detailed description on the issue and even a video of it.\n\nI think there should be a way to choose the detail level of a terrain collider based on the mipmaps of the heightmap image. So basically the collider could be defined by a lower detail version of the terrain shape to avoid performance issues. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/639/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/638","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/638/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/638/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/638/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/638","id":55457956,"number":638,"title":"Multiple viewports for Drawable2D's","user":{"login":"cadaver","id":51361,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/51361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver","html_url":"https://github.com/cadaver","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/3","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/3/labels","id":1111389,"number":3,"title":"1.4","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":169,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-05-15T05:00:35Z","updated_at":"2015-05-15T05:13:25Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2015-05-15T05:13:25Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-01-26T08:42:38Z","updated_at":"2015-05-15T05:05:08Z","closed_at":"2015-01-26T23:21:49Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Renderer2D performs batching optimization for Drawable2D's, meaning that it needs to know upfront (in the UpdateBatches phase) how many drawables there are and what batches they will end up forming.\n\nHowever, batch update happens long before rendering.

think that this feature helps a lot with navigation on hierarchy list more fast. I made a simple example image of that. Of how it may looks.\nwhen you select \"all\" - in hierarchy list shows all nodes\nwhen you select other tag in hierarchy list show nodes (with his childs) only have that tag in node vars.\n\nand when nodes create by user in editor or when SomeScene.xml loads to editor the hierarchy window looks to \"tag\" variable of each scene node and if it present, the hierarchy window made an new tag group (if not yet exist) or store ID of node in alredy existed tagset.

This is bread and butter code, should the user really have to worry about a trailing slash or not when it's so easy for the API to do it in a portable way?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/611","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/611/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/611/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/611/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/611","id":54494278,"number":611,"title":"Provide Lua bindings for ResourceCache.resourceDirs","user":{"login":"JTippetts","id":5596061,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5596061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JTippetts","html_url":"https://github.com/JTippetts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JTippetts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JTippetts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JTippetts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JTippetts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JTippetts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JTippetts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JTippetts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JTippetts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JTippetts/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038070,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/3","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/3/labels","id":1111389,"number":3,"title":"1.4","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":169,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-05-15T05:00:35Z","updated_at":"2015-05-15T05:13:25Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2015-05-15T05:13:25Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-01-15T19:42:46Z","updated_at":"2015-05-15T05:05:44Z","closed_at":"2015-01-16T14:30:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Currently, ResourceCache::GetResourceDirs() is not accessible via Lua, making it so there is no good way for accessing the user-provided resource locations.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4617","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507250212","x-github-request-id":"CA4D:572C:1677A24:2C9EDED:59D6C9EC","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/13266601/issues?state=all&page=52>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/13266601/issues?state=all&page=72>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/13266601/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/13266601/issues?state=all&page=50>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"442b467324f637abd2e7ccceb50e6f72\"","status":"200 OK"}}
