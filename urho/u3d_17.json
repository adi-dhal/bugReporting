This is very convenient as it allows to use said functions in modern c++ loops like `for (auto child : node->GetChildren())`. It also is not a performance issue if modern compiler is used since compilers rewrite calls that return objects by value to calls that receive variable by reference for storing return value.\n\n`IntVector2::Length()` - self explanatory.\n\n`Node::SetTransform(const Matrix3x4& matrix)` - a convenience function expanding to `SetTransform(matrix.Translation(), matrix.Rotation(), matrix.Scale());`.\n\n~~Log writing functions `Log::Write(int level, const char* messageFormat, ...)` and `Log::WriteArgs(int level, const char* messageFormat, va_list ap)` - write formatted log messages using `String::AppendWithFormatArgs()`. Now debug message logging is way more convenient.~~\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1653/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1652","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1652/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1652/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1652/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1652","id":183198986,"number":1652,"title":"Mouse visible by default","user":{"login":"rokups","id":19151258,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/19151258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups","html_url":"https://github.com/rokups","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":12,"created_at":"2016-10-15T09:15:36Z","updated_at":"2016-10-16T13:31:04Z","closed_at":"2016-10-16T12:30:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/pulls/1652","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1652","diff_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1652.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1652.patch"},"body":"~~Currently mouse is hidden by default. We can make mouse visible in `Application::Start()` but at this point engine has already centered mouse cursor. If game is started in a windowed mode it artificially changes mouse cursor position to the center of a window which is undesired behavior. With mouse visible by default this does not happen. Games that do not require mouse to be visible or need mouse centered can explicitly do this in `Application::Start()` method.~~\n\nNew engine parameters:\n- MouseVisible: controls initial OS cursor visibility.\n- MousseMode: controls initial OS cursor mode.\n\nUse of engine parameters allows to avoid undesired mouse cursor centering in windowed applications that require visible cursor.\n\nNotable changes:\n- `Engine::HasParameter()` is no longer static.\n- `Engine::GetParameter()` is no longer static.\n\nThese methods were used only in `Engine::Initialize()` method so impact is minimal.\n\nSetting mouse parameters before window initialization did nothing and setting them after window initialization centered mouse anyway. The only sensible way was to set these parameters upon `Input` subsystem initialization when window is available. This conveniently happens on first `E_SCREENMODE` event. I had to store parsed parameters in `Engine::engineParameters_` member to allow `Input` subsystem to access parameters at correct time.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1652/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1651","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1651/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1651/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1651/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1651","id":183198671,"number":1651,"title":"Missing

Which holds true on 32 bit platforms. However, on 64 bit platforms, because each sub union includes a pointer, the size of the structure doubles in size. And the other pointers except the first one `ptr_` are actually never used in code. Actually, even keeping just `ptr_` inside the first union pushes the structure size to 24 bytes on 64 bits. Should be 20 bytes but probably needs to satisfy alignment.\n\nI suppose the entire union could be summed to:\n\n```\nunion VariantValue\n{\n    int                 int_[4];\n    float               float_[4];\n    void *              ptr_; // or ptr_[16 / sizeof(ptr)]?\n    bool                bool_;\n};\n```\n\nOr this way to keep the naming:\n\n```\nunion VariantValue\n{\n    struct { int int_, int2_, int3_, int4_; };\n    struct { float float_, float2_, float3_, float4_; };\n    void * ptr_;\n    bool bool_;\n};\n```\n\nIf this was the intended behavior then please ignore this.\n\nEDIT: I just realized that because of this, `float2_` will have an offset of 4 bytes from `float_` and same with `int2_` and `int_`.
