I'm fairly certain this is a bug with the exporter, as I can export each LOD individually with no problems, then use the AssetImporter tool to put them together in one file, and then it works without problems.

large number of users use laptops which have dual graphics cards. By default if program is not recognised as a game it uses integrated intel hd card which gives poor performance. However, there is a way to force using nvidia high performance graphics on Windows. \n\nMore info:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/10535950/forcing-nvidia-gpu-programmatically-in-optimus-laptops\n\ncode to add somewhere in the source:\n\nextern \"C\" {\n    _declspec(dllexport) DWORD NvOptimusEnablement = 0x00000001;\n}\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/138","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/138/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/138/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/138/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/138","id":25881424,"number":138,"title":"Refract pass will output black if hardware multisampling is in use","user":{"login":"cadaver","id":51361,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/51361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver","html_url":"https://github.com/cadaver","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/1/labels","id":590529,"number":1,"title":"1.31","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":216,"state":"closed","created_at":"2014-03-07T14:42:58Z","updated_at":"2014-03-07T14:52:11Z","due_on":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2014-03-07T14:52:11Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-01-19T14:45:22Z","updated_at":"2014-03-07T14:46:43Z","closed_at":"2014-01-20T22:27:10Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Refract pass does not currently resolve properly when hardware multisampling is in use; instead the output will be completely black.
