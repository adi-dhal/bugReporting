objects.\n\nThanks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1584/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1583","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1583/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1583/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1583/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1583","id":176729389,"number":1583,"title":"AnimationController

Recently I update my local master with new from Github, and now I have broken spline path in my test scene with stairs.\n\nI think that now editor do not serialize spline points properly (?)  \nOr maybe it's because now I use vs2015 instead vs2013 ? (previously the tested scene was compiled with vs2013)\n\nvideo with this bug:  https://youtu.be/NJxnoKxL4aA\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1576/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1575","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1575/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1575/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1575/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1575","id":176232885,"number":1575,"title":"(Feature request) NavigationPushiness::NAVIGATIONPUSHINESS_NONE","user":{"login":"1vanK","id":13021826,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13021826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK","html_url":"https://github.com/1vanK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038070,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true},{"id":61125319,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/feature%20request","name":"feature request","color":"fbca04","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-09-11T08:59:37Z","updated_at":"2016-09-11T13:43:10Z","closed_at":"2016-09-11T13:43:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Need new paramether for agent->SetNavigationPushiness()\n\n```\nvoid CrowdAgent::UpdateParameters(unsigned scope)\n{\n    ...\n        if (scope & SCOPE_NAVIGATION_PUSHINESS_PARAMS)\n        {\n            switch (navPushiness_)\n            {\n            case NAVIGATIONPUSHINESS_NONE:\n                params.separationWeight = 0.0f;\n                params.collisionQueryRange = radius_ * 1.0f;\n                break;\n```\n\nI tested with this settings.
