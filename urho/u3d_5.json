I've removed the\r\n'subpixelGlyphPositions' flag and replaced it with a couple of values:\r\n'fontSubpixelThreshold' sets the point at which subpixel positioning\r\nkicks on, and 'fontOversampleLimit' caps the maximum amount of stretching.\r\n\r\nThe default values are 12pt text and max 3x oversampling. These are fairly\r\nconservative settings, which should improve small text without wasting\r\na lot of memory.\r\n\r\nNote that when the font hint level is NORMAL (the default), subpixel\r\npositioning and oversampling are both disabled.

Valgrind I noticed memory leak when invoking `CollisionChain2D::SetVertex` to change last vertex. This causes `RecreateFixture()` to be called. `RecreateFixture()`, in turn, does the following:\r\n\r\n    if (loop_)\r\n        chainShape_.CreateLoop(&b2Vertices[0], count);\r\n    else\r\n        chainShape_.CreateChain(&b2Vertices[0], count);\r\nBut both of these Box2D methods  contains the following string:\r\n\r\n    b2Assert(m_vertices == nullptr && m_count == 0); //From github, Urho3D version uses NULL instead\r\n\r\nThus, this contract is broken when one CollisionChain2D component is modified multiple times (I had tried to create simple deformable terrain using this component). It causes the old 'm_vertices' array to be lost every time. Such a code should also crash if asserts are enabled.\r\n\r\nAdding 'chainShape_.Clear()' before above code in 'CollisionChain2D' will probably fix this problem. Attaching pull request.\r\n\r\nP.S. Don't have much experience with either C++ and github contributing, so I'm not sure if I'm doing right opening issue and creating pull request simultaneously (and that this solution is correct). And sorry for non-native english.\r\n\r\nP.P.S. I also noticed that a new 'b2ChainShape' instance is created when calling 'CollisionShape2D::CreateFixture()' and is destroyed when calling 'CollisionShape2D::ReleaseFixture()'.

In Emscripten `-s DISABLE_EXCEPTION_CATCHING=1` is often paired with `-fno-exceptions` to disallow `throw` statements as well - would that be intentional for
