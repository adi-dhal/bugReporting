Removing code that creates strings limps along a little further, so the errors seem to be focused around how strings/objects are being allocated.  At one point I also saw an error about an assertion volation where the refcount was off by one as well.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what is causing this; it seems that calling functions works, as tracing through shows some methods do in fact work when the C++ and AS boundary is crossed.  It seems to be something related to constructors and reference counting, as though objects are being prematurely freed on their way out to AS  I did a third debug build under the native GCC and that particular build works, so it does appear to be compiler specific.

I saw it was not possible to do this elegantly, without some ugly hacks. The most prevalent problems are:\n- Unclear seperation between client and server, i solved this partially by making the client and server seperate dlls, loaded by an exe whose only purpose is to set up Urho and execute the client and server dlls. One can then use #defines to make shared code aware in which context (client or server) it is running.\n- Engine Subsystems are shared between client and server. This is not wanted for some subsys, as the only exchange of information between the client and the server should be over the network. If, for example, I have a SceneManager storing all scenes of the client or server, I would not want the client to access a server scene. This is not possible in the current Urho3D engine without ugly hacks.\n\nTherefore I propose this:\nAdd an optional parameter to RegisterSubsystem, RemoveSubsystem, GetSubsystem to specify whether it should be accessible by the client, server, or both/singleplayer (parameter absent). This allows registering a single class twice, so there is no interference and the class does not need to do the  checking itself. It also preserves backwards compatibility.\n\nMy question to you is if this is an optimal solution, and whether this would be accepted as a pull request.\nIf the feedback is positive, I will make the change and make a pull request as soon as I can.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/705","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/705/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/705/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/705/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/705","id":68921219,"number":705,"title":"Fix PCH build with Clang","user":{"login":"evolarium","id":5010373,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5010373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/evolarium","html_url":"https://github.com/evolarium","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evolarium/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evolarium/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evolarium/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evolarium/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evolarium/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evolarium/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evolarium/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evolarium/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evolarium/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/3","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/3/labels","id":1111389,"number":3,"title":"1.4","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":169,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-05-15T05:00:35Z","updated_at":"2015-05-15T05:13:25Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2015-05-15T05:13:25Z"},"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-04-16T13:15:20Z","updated_at":"2015-05-19T02:54:49Z","closed_at":"2015-04-16T23:53:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/pulls/705","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/705","diff_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/705.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/705.patch"},"body":"Clang doesn't use include path (-I) when looking for PCH files.
