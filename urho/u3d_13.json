by Unity and #1741\r\nI plan to implement a kind of attribute meta information.\r\n\r\nIntroduce new (probably virtual) class (e.g. `AttributeMetaInfo`).\r\nAdd optional pointer to `AttributeInfo` that specifies attribute meta information.\r\nBy design, meta information mustn't be used in Urho core and affect important processes like serialization.\r\nHowever, it can (and will) be freely used by customers who need some facultative information about attributes.\r\n\r\nExamples of meta info:\r\n- Vector information from #1742\r\n- Bitmask view flag\r\n- Realtime apply control (now relatime apply is disabled for some hard-coded attributes)\r\n- (New) Value ranges for numeric attributes and many other things.\r\n\r\nI am going to work on it when I publish usable version of my Editor
