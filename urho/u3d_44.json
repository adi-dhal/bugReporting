This approach breaks for maps saved in more recent versions of Tiled. This is because the width and height are only saved when they differ from the default (0), and because the width and height are now also used to store the size of tile objects.\n\nSo for maps saved with Tiled >= 0.12, this change:\n- Fixes identification of rectangle and ellipse objects with 0 width and height (which was leading to the entire map failing to load).\n- Fixes identification of tile

which derives from Resources, does not override the virtual `BeginLoad()` method instead it implements a non-virtual function `Load()` of Resource class. Due to this, value animations cannot be loaded from resource file into a ValueAnimation object. \nFunny enough, the codes in `Load()`, I suppose, are meant to be the codes in `BeginLoad()`.\nImplementing `BeginLoad()` method in the source solves this problem. \n\n```\nbool ValueAnimation::BeginLoad(Deserializer& source)\n{\n    XMLFile xmlFile(context_);\n    if (!xmlFile.Load(source))\n    return false;\n\n    return LoadXML(xmlFile.GetRoot());\n}\n```\n\nThis issue can be verified with the below code\n\n```\nsphereNode_ = scene_->CreateChild(\"SphereNode\");\nsphereNode_->Scale(3);\nsphereNode_->Translate(Vector3(0,4,0));\nResourceCache* cache = GetSubsystem<ResourceCache>();\n\nStaticModel* sphereModel = sphereNode_->CreateComponent<StaticModel>();\nsphereModel->SetModel(cache->GetResource<Model>(\"Models/Sphere.mdl\"));\nsphereModel->SetMaterial(cache->GetResource<Material>(\"Materials/Stone.xml\"));\n\nValueAnimation*valAnim=cache->GetResource<ValueAnimation(\"Objects/sphereScaleAnimation.xml\");\n\nsphereNode_->SetAttributeAnimation(\"Scale\",valAnim, WM_ONCE);\n```\n\nhere is the sample ValueAnimation file used (sphereScaleAnimation.xml)\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<valueanimation interpolationmethod=\"Linear\">\n    <keyframe time=\"0\" type=\"Vector3\" value=\"3 3 3\" />\n    <keyframe time=\"0.5\" type=\"Vector3\" value=\"6 6 6\" />\n    <keyframe time=\"1\" type=\"Vector3\" value=\"3 3 3\" />\n</valueanimation>\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/827","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/827/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/827/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/827/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/827","id":99314154,"number":827,"title":"Engine crashes on Intel HD Graphics/OpenGL build (Win 7 x64)","user":{"login":"rasteron","id":3676827,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3676827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasteron","html_url":"https://github.com/rasteron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasteron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasteron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasteron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasteron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasteron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasteron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasteron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasteron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasteron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038071,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"e6e6e6","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/5/labels","id":1408188,"number":5,"title":"1.5","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":289,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-11-12T10:20:35Z","updated_at":"2015-11-18T08:30:55Z","due_on":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2015-11-12T10:47:52Z"},"comments":7,"created_at":"2015-08-05T22:35:51Z","updated_at":"2015-11-12T10:37:22Z","closed_at":"2015-08-07T01:27:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I got to compile this again with my Core i3 laptop with Intel HD on board.
