The problem, however, is that all rigidbodies seem to slide on a surface when they should be at rest- even if friction and linear damping are set to absurdly high values. I have investigated further and found that this behavior is exhibited even in a completely normal setting- rigidbodies seem to drift along whatever surface they're on, usually in the positive Z-direction.

the most elegant of solutions, but wanted to stick to using the WorkItem structure.

works like it currently does using:\n\n```\nSubscribeToEvent(\"Foo\",\"FooHandler\");\n```\n\nWhere if called inside a procedural function the ScriptFile will handle it, if called inside an object if that object was created through a ScriptInstance that ScriptInstance will handle the event, otherwise the ScriptFile associated with the current script module will handle it.\n\nThere is one caveat with this, you can't have multiple objects have the same event with no sender specified ie:\n\n```\nclass Foo()\n{\n     ...\n    Foo()\n    {\n        SubscribeToEvent(\"Update\",\"FooUpdateHandler\");\n    }\n    ...\n}\n\nclass Bar()\n{\n    ...\n    Bar()\n    {\n        SubscribeToEvent(\"Update\",\"BarUpdateHandler\");\n    }\n    ...\n}\n\nFoo@ foo;\nBar@ bar;\n\nvoid Start()\n{\n    @foo = Foo();\n    @bar = Bar();\n}\n```\n\nOnly Bar's event hanlder would be called as Foo's handler would be erased.\n\nThis also make starting directly in objects when using a ScriptFile easier, as that main object can handle all necessary events like Update and pass them down the chain instead of requiring a procedural function to do so meaning no global object declarations are necessary. \n\n```\nscriptFile_ = GetSubsystem<ResourceCache>()->GetResource<ScriptFile>(\"Scripts/Editor.as\");\n\nif (scriptFile_)\n    scriptObject_ = scriptFile_->CreateObject(\"Editor\");\n\n// If script loading is successful, proceed to main loop\nif (scriptObject_ && scriptFile_->Execute(scriptObject_, \"void Start()\"))\n```\n\n~~(No hints as what's in the process of being re-written with this
