there!\nI've been looking at this engine, and it looks very impressive!\nHowever, I've stumbled upon a use-case for which there does not seem to be any support.\nAccording to the examples and the manual, multiplayer can only be done using two different processes; While in many games, the client and server can be separate threads in the same process.\n\nI've tried to replicate this in urho, by creating two contexts and Client and Server Applications, and running the server first in an std::async, followed by the client being ->Run() normally, as no window would open with the client also in an async. It compiles, and even runs without crashing. But it is extremely slow, and the console is flooded with \"Sending events is only supported from the main thread\". It is clear that the server is causing interference somehow.\nHaving it be possible to run the client and the server in one process would certainly be a great addition to the engine, and I am willing to work on that, but first I wanted to ask you guys if you have done any research on this, if you have any tips, or if you can say for certain that this task is simply not suited to the architecture of the engine?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/664/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/663","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/663/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/663/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/663/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/663","id":57693582,"number":663,"title":"selection of objects in the editor is uncomfortable","user":{"login":"v0van1981","id":9742588,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/9742588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/v0van1981","html_url":"https://github.com/v0van1981","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v0van1981/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v0van1981/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v0van1981/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v0van1981/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v0van1981/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v0van1981/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v0van1981/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v0van1981/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v0van1981/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038071,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"e6e6e6","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/3","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/3/labels","id":1111389,"number":3,"title":"1.4","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":169,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-05-15T05:00:35Z","updated_at":"2015-05-15T05:13:25Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2015-05-15T05:13:25Z"},"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-02-14T13:51:21Z","updated_at":"2015-05-15T05:05:08Z","closed_at":"2015-02-14T16:29:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When many objects in the scene is very uncomfortable to find for them in the list.

is a known problem (See #430 and #536) that Travis-CI has a serious memory problem in their worker VM snapshots. Some worker snapshots come with a reduced memory to begin with even before CI build starts and some how the memory kept leaking while CI build is in progress. When the free memory is almost completely used up, to the point that the swap partition cannot help then process would get killed.\n\nWe have provided our analysis on this problem to upstream but so far there is still no resolution from upstream. We have also enhanced our CI build to be as memory efficient as possible, even with \"build rule\" to automatically switch build configuration and/or skip processes in the CI build (e.g. make test) when detected a \"bad\" VM snapshot being used.\n\nHowever, despite our best effort to mitigate this problem, we have only delayed the inevitable from happening sooner, i.e. not  while our CI build still in progress. With more and more samples being included into our repository, the situation is becoming more difficult and we start to see the process being killed problem back again toward the end of our CI builds lately. Mostly while attempting to upload the build artifacts or to update the main website. Since those are not considered critical processes in our CI build, the overall build status remains green. But sooner or later the process getting killed will be from one of our critical processes when Urho3D code base keeps growing.\n\nProposed solution:\n- Evaluate to switch to other CI solutions, like Jenkins.\n- Stay on Travis CI but evaluate to switch to use Docker (http://blog.travis-ci.com/2014-12-17-faster-builds-with-container-based-infrastructure/). The only caveat is, the Docker-container build infrastructure does not allow to use \"sudo\" command and currently our CI builds use this command in a few places.\n\nWe should all keep an eye on the number of samples in the project until the problem is fully resolved. Combining a few easier or related samples into one, if have to.

The sample uses the Lua sample framework and sets up a very simple scene. It displays the currently used memory as reported by collectgarbage(\"count\"). If you execute the script, you are given the option to press 'd' to run the function:\n\n[code]\nfunction DoThing()\n    local c\n    for c=1,10000000,1 do\n        local c=Color(1,1,1,1)\n    end\nend\n[/code]\n\nAll it does is loop a large number of times and create a local Color object. (It's not just Color objects that exhibit the problem; pretty much any object type will do.) The loop will execute, then the update function will update the on-screen text with the amount of memory currently being used. Update also includes an explicit call to collectgarbage() to execute a full collection cycle.\n\nHere is a screenshot from before 'd' is pressed: http://i.imgur.com/nMaE6fZ.png\n\nHere is a screenshot from after: http://i.imgur.com/xxNeZm0.png\n\nAs you can see, even with the collectgarbage() call, there is still a LOT of memory used, memory that should be freed up by a garbage collection cycle because it was all allocated as temporary locals inside the DoThing loop. Note also the drastic framerate drop. This drop is permanent, as is the memory hogging. Leaving the window to run for several minutes results in zero change.\n\nI noticed this behavior with a game project that I have since semi-abandoned due to performance issues. As time went by the framerate would drop to unworkable levels. Revisiting the project and logging reported memory use showed that garbage was accruing and never being cleaned up, resulting in a progressive performance loss.\n\nEdit: The behavior occurs in builds using both Lua and
