They all give an error dialog: \"ERROR: Failed to add resource path 'Data', check the documentation on how to set the 'resource path prefix' \"  The samples work in the build directory just fine, due to resolution of #994.  However the resource path is not valid for the final installation directory.\n\nSeveral possibilities exist for solving the problem.  A claimed complication is that on Unix systems, the user may use DESTDIR to change the installation target.  The effective prefix becomes $(DESTDIR)/${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} and it will only be known at installation time, after CMake has generated a native build system.  This makes it difficult but not impossible to use an absolute path, as the method for capturing DESTDIR would be build system or OS specific.  One for instance could capture it in a Bourne shell script.  This means the target development environment would have to use Bourne shell scripts, which may not always be a valid assumption.  A recent post on the CMake mailing list, asked how to handle DESTDIR in a generator agnostic manner, and claimed to have problems using the Ninja generator.  Nobody answered his question.\n\nEasier approach: a relative path would work fine, as the end result is just installation to 1 directory somewhere.  The Urho3D installation tree structure is static and known at configuration time.\n\nDESTDIR is a Unix-specific complication, it doesn't affect Windows.  Windows systems cannot use DESTDIR because they have a drive letter as part of an absolute path.  Concatenating absolute paths on Windows doesn't produce a valid path.  This is documented in the CMake docs and nobody uses DESTDIR on Windows.  Or if they do, they deserve what they get.\n\nDESTDIR can also mess up various aspects of a CMake build even on a Unix system.  At least as of 2011 Alexander Neundorf, a principal CMake developer, claimed it would mess up RPATH.  http://cmake.3232098.n2.nabble.com/DESTDIR-behaviour-with-different-variable-name-td6261440.html   \n\n```\nDESTDIR has a different purpose.\nInstalling to DESTDIR does not necessarily lead to a working and correct\ninstallation, mainly when paths are involved, like e.g. RPATH settings.\nAssuming that CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX would be /opt/foo, your executable might\nget /opt/foo/lib as RPATH, also when installed to $DESTDIR/opt/foo.\nSo they will not have a correct RPATH.\nYou really should set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.\n```\n\nErgo, having the samples obtain a relative resource path, that is different for the build and installation trees, would be a sensible way to fix this.  One way to obtain such a path is to have a file such as \"resources.ini\" in the same directory as the samples.  It would contain the needed relative path and be read by the samples.  The contents of resources.ini would be changed at build and installation times.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1000/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/999","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/999/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/999/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/999/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/999","id":114361699,"number":999,"title":"ConsoleInput sample crashes with access violation","user":{"login":"bvanevery","id":734930,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/734930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery","html_url":"https://github.com/bvanevery","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/5/labels","id":1408188,"number":5,"title":"1.5","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":289,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-11-12T10:20:35Z","updated_at":"2015-11-18T08:30:55Z","due_on":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2015-11-12T10:47:52Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-10-30T21:47:51Z","updated_at":"2015-11-12T10:40:09Z","closed_at":"2015-10-31T16:07:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Windows 7, 64-bit, VS 2015.

As the sample is demonstrating pathfinding, placing and removing obstacles is a critical feature for exercising non-trivial pathfinding cases.  Of 3 Windows laptops that I own, only 1 has a middle mouse button.  It's an unusual design I don't remember seeing anywhere else, and I've never actually used that button for anything ever.\n\nLack of a middle mouse button is probably typical of laptop users.  I just looked at Apple's MacBook Pro site, and their touchpad doesn't have explicit buttons at all.  Probably they have implicit regions of sensitivity, and it wouldn't shock me if those only emulate Left and Right buttons.  Culturally on Windows, a middle button just isn't typically part of the UI scheme.  A central \"scroll wheel\" is typical, and I do have side swiping emulation on all 3 of my laptop touchpads for that.  But this is not the same functionality as a middle button you can actually press.\n\nWould suggest mapping that functionality to any reasonable keyboard key.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/995/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/994","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/994/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/994/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/994/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/994","id":114131092,"number":994,"title":".exe samples do not have resource paths","user":{"login":"bvanevery","id":734930,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/734930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery","html_url":"https://github.com/bvanevery","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038070,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/5/labels","id":1408188,"number":5,"title":"1.5","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":289,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-11-12T10:20:35Z","updated_at":"2015-11-18T08:30:55Z","due_on":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2015-11-12T10:47:52Z"},"comments":14,"created_at":"2015-10-29T19:45:03Z","updated_at":"2015-11-12T10:36:44Z","closed_at":"2015-10-30T11:20:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I am pretty sure that I have run .exe samples just fine in the past, either from within Visual Studio, or clicking on them in \\bin when they're in the build directory.

This observed on both Windows 7 and Windows 10 machines.  I do get a big MKLINK error on both systems when first configuring CMake, but not subsequently. \n\n.bat samples run fine because they explicitly pass a Data directory option to the Urho3DPlayer.\n\nNote that hardwiring a single path for the build directory is not desirable, as the samples will be installed and need to be runnable from their final installation directory.  Yet it is still desirable to have them be runnable from the build directory, so that people can trace the code with a debugger.  This furthermore implies that using a global environment variable to specify resource paths is not desirable.\n\nAlthough the Docs do specify some ways to cause the samples to work, I submit that all of the methods given in the docs are wrong / this is a bug by design.  Samples should just work.  The build knows where the resources are, and where they should go.  This should be automated and not require user intervention nor reading the docs.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/994/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/993","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/993/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/993/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/993/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/993","id":113961754,"number":993,"title":"ParticleEmitter->GetEffect() incorrectly returns null","user":{"login":"Modanung","id":7316241,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7316241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Modanung","html_url":"https://github.com/Modanung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Modanung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Modanung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Modanung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Modanung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Modanung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Modanung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Modanung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Modanung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Modanung/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/5/labels","id":1408188,"number":5,"title":"1.5","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":289,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-11-12T10:20:35Z","updated_at":"2015-11-18T08:30:55Z","due_on":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2015-11-12T10:47:52Z"},"comments":7,"created_at":"2015-10-29T01:52:24Z","updated_at":"2015-11-25T05:13:53Z","closed_at":"2015-10-29T13:39:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The effects are visible, but GetEffect() returns null.

testing out the engine on various Android architectures (wanting to support all of them, as the engine is blazingly fast and smaller than it technically should even be), I came across an issue, or rather, the issue came across me - MIPS build doesn't work, random compilation error.\n\nSeeing as that error is _something with graphics_, I've instantly gotten an image of the librarydrivereverythingOpenGL not supporting MIPS before my eyes, and that I won't be able to publish my app to such of an underrated architecture ~~no one even uses~~, thankfully it turned out (much) easier to fix than that - there is a collision between the mips constant used during compilation, and a random variable in the Texture code named the same way.\n\nHaving easily fixed it and verified that with the fix the Android MIPS build compiles (and runs, at least as far as the emulator goes) successfully, I request this to be merged.\n\nAs always, Thank You for Your work into making and supporting the engine! Keep it up!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/989/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/988","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/988/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/988/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/988/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/988","id":113563257,"number":988,"title":"Finding HashMap Node while it is being cleared returns incorrect result","user":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/5/labels","id":1408188,"number":5,"title":"1.5","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":289,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-11-12T10:20:35Z","updated_at":"2015-11-18T08:30:55Z","due_on":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2015-11-12T10:47:52Z"},"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-10-27T11:34:21Z","updated_at":"2015-11-12T10:40:09Z","closed_at":"2015-10-27T13:44:07Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"When shutting down the engine, Context destructor attempts to clear all the registered subsystems (calling `subystems_.Clear()`) which in turns trigger each subsystem to clean after itself in its destructor. The problem arises when one of the subsystem, Script, attempt to find an already destroyed subsystem (calling `GetSubsystem<ResourceCache>()`) in its destructor. In a nutshell, the HashMap::Find() call is done inside the HashMap::Clear(). In Debug build configuration, the Find() returns null. In non-Debug build configuration, it returns non-null value. In MinGW build, this non-null value crashes the app later (https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/blob/master/Source/Urho3D/AngelScript/Script.cpp#L163).\n\nI am not sure how to fix this.

I came across an issue - Android hardware keyboard input behaves weird.\n\nAnd by weird, I mean truly weird.\n\nTilde (like many other keys, although this one is especially important to me amongst them) calls E_KEYUP and E_KEYDOWN only when no textboxes (such as the LineEdit) are focused, spacebar doesn't even get written in textboxes, enter key randomly defocuses textboxes where on other platforms it doesn't, backspace, while pressed, totally hangs the application where no other key would - and that's probably only a part of the madness.\n\nAfter a long while of checking where such issue could even be located, and another long while of figuring out what could be wrong I rechecked my makeshift issue list, where the backspace issue led me to removing random conditionals which seemed unneeded, and so did seem event.isPrintingKey() - Bingo!\n\nIn short, not only isn't event.isPrintingKey() needed to block the keys that aren't supposed to print out anything (at least with the more common keys - never ran into such occurrence in my extensive tests), but it also blocks keys it shouldn't, causes random defocusing and may cause random hangups with (seemingly) even more random keys!\n\nWhile it might still seem bizarre to remove a part of the code which ought to be a major check, in reality the \"major check\" does more harm than good (if it does any good at all), while it's lack seems to perfectly unite the Android behavior with the rest of platforms, therefore I request this to be pulled.\n\nHuge thanks to anyone making and supporting the engine - You're doing a great job! Keep it up!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/987/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/986","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/986/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/986/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/986/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/986","id":113536026,"number":986,"title":"Remove
