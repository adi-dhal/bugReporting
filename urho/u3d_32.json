reset them to a previous unsuppressed state (ResetMouseMode, \nResetMouseGrabbed).\n- Updated Console to react to mouse modes, similarly to mouse visibility previously.\n- Console will utilize UI cursor if available.\n- Fixed a bug with mouse modes not calling SetMouseGrab correctly.\n- Updated samples to use different mouse modes where necessary.\n- Updated samples to request pointer lock on mouse down event (Web platform).\n- Updated samples that show the UI cursor to show the OS cursor if pointer lock (ie, mouse mode MM_RELATIVE) \nisn't acquired. This conceals a visual bug in UI cursor position (Web platform).\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1207/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1206","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1206/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1206/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1206/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1206","id":135082764,"number":1206,"title":"merge

am attempting to use Urho2D, however anytime the camera node is rotated (say, with rotate2d), the clipping bounds of the Urho2D nodes appear to be getting constrained on the left/right axis. Easiest way to reproduce it, just open the sample of 24_Urho2DSprite, at the end of the HandleUpdate method just add:\n\n```\ncameraNode_->Rotate2D(timeStep*10.0f);\n```\n\nThen run it and watch what happens. I am trying to have a follow camera above the 2D player that rotates as the player rotates, however that appears difficult to do when everything becomes invisible at about 45 degrees and on...\n\nIt also happens on the 36_Urho2DTileMap sample by adding the same code at the same place, you can watch the tiles vanish at the edges on in.\n\nEDIT:  Putting everything in the world 'but' the players unit and rotating it has no issue other than adding another transformation frame to everything, only rotating the node with the camera causes an
