Like as some of commands of render path are missing.\nI guessing because not all commands apply to renderer by some issue, or maybe (other my guessing) what the XMLParser have some problems with parsing.\n\nAnd if i several times do selecting other RP and then try to choice the RP what i needed - it works as expected. This is not only editor problem I have a same behavior in my compiled project.\n\nAlso I do debug trace of my project. I look into (DoF) RP-commands one by one.\nand find what the  command->outputs_ vector are always empty,  even if I have custom or \"viewport\" output RT for quad command.
