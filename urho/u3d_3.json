Input is handled by UI subsystem, so anything that worked on normal UI will work on UI rendered on to 3D object. This required a minor change for input handling. Previously \"screen\" was considered surface of entire window. Now screen is considered area of `root_element_position` + `root_element_size`. This is fully backwards-compatible.\r\n\r\nThere is one issue i am unable to solve: since on OpenGL texture coordinates start from bottom-left corner a workaround is needed. Texture is flipped by projection matrix, however it breaks scissor test. I do not know how to properly fix it therefore scissor test is disabled when rendering into texture on OpenGL. Issue is clearly visible when scrolling a `ListView` in `HelloGUI` sample when UI is rendered on to a cube. Any help regarding OpenGL issue would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nOther changes: lua and angelscript bindings, HelloGUI sample can toggle between rendering on screen or rendering on cube, added a ListView to HelloGUI sample window.\r\n\r\n![screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19151258/29453889-c245ce12-83fa-11e7-93be-3f29c34b5f25.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/2074/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/2073","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/2073/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/2073/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/2073/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/2073","id":250926859,"number":2073,"title":"SIGINT ignored on linux in headless mode","user":{"login":"TheComet","id":3390890,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3390890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheComet","html_url":"https://github.com/TheComet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheComet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheComet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheComet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheComet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheComet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheComet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheComet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheComet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheComet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-08-17T12:27:59Z","updated_at":"2017-08-17T16:43:21Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"When launching an application in headless mode, pressing CTRL-C does nothing.

At least to make some IDEs happy :grin:\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/2066/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/2065","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/2065/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/2065/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/2065/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/2065","id":249378364,"number":2065,"title":"URHO3D VS static version compiled with /MT","user":{"login":"coldev","id":1064095,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1064095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coldev","html_url":"https://github.com/coldev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coldev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coldev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coldev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coldev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coldev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coldev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coldev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coldev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coldev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038073,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/wontfix","name":"wontfix","color":"ffffff","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-08-10T15:05:35Z","updated_at":"2017-08-10T15:17:20Z","closed_at":"2017-08-10T15:17:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Is possible include a true portable version from static version from URHO3D...\r\n\r\nnot VC runtimes required..\r\n\r\n/MD sucks\r\n\r\nCompile the next static version from urho3d with  /MT  option in VS\r\n\r\nThanks...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/2065/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/2064","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/2064/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/2064/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/2064/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/2064","id":249221996,"number":2064,"title":"Engine hangs when removing compound shape","user":{"login":"pqftgs","id":4343398,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4343398?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pqftgs","html_url":"https://github.com/pqftgs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pqftgs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pqftgs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pqftgs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pqftgs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pqftgs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pqftgs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pqftgs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pqftgs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pqftgs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2017-08-10T03:25:07Z","updated_at":"2017-08-15T04:30:15Z","closed_at":"2017-08-12T10:41:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"To replicate:\r\n1.

It's now possible to have IKSolver components that share the same subtrees ([#2058](https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/2058)).\r\n  - Urho avoids the call to abort() by not calling ik_solver_solve() if the tree is invalid.\r\n  - Fixed a bug in solver_FABRIK_solve() where the root position was incorrectly being set to the original root node position instead of the active root node position. This bug made it impossible to move the root node if USE_ORIGINAL_POSE was disabled.\r\n  - Added a chain tree iterator, which allows Urho to iterate over only the nodes that are affected by the solver instead of having to iterate over all nodes in the tree.\r\n  - The scripting API for SetFeature()/GetFeature() was changed, such that now you can write ```solver.FEATURE_NAME = true``` directly, instead of having to type ```solver.SetFeature(IKFeature.FEATURE_NAME, true)```\r\n  - Updating/Adding docstrings.\r\n\r\nThere are still two changes I'd like to get in before the 1.7 release.
