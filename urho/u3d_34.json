pull request will add particle direction inspired by Unity stretched billboard particles. If any of you have tried that on Unity, stretched particle can create pseudo 3d effect despite still using billboard. It can be really useful for sparking effects and many other stuffs. \n\nScreenshot:\n![partikel_1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5253453/12228806/c5337502-b872-11e5-8836-46a80402e7dd.png)\n\nYou can see this particle in action at example 'Particle/Burst.xml' or just see this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR7KtF6qtaU\n\nAbout the implementation, I modify the billboard object to store direction. This data only works if new face camera mode FC_DIRECTION is used. If this mode is used, billboard will rotate facing camera with direction as axis, so it will create pseudo 3D effect. Because every billboard has different rotation, Urho needs to calculate rotation for every billboard. For now, CPU is doing those calculation, but I have plan to move them to the GPU.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1144/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1143","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1143/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1143/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1143/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1143","id":125849770,"number":1143,"title":"Missing

this branch was intended only to unify the 'ci' rake task used by the AppVeyor and Travis-CI to reduce code duplication and hopefully easier for future maintenance. Ruby script is a good match with CMake to target multiple-platforms, so the unification can be done without much trouble. However, while working on this, through the CI jobs I discovered a genuine configuration defect for iOS platform and was able to fix it. And one thing follows another I realized the URHO3D_LUAJIT should be baked into the export header because once the LuaJIT is enabled then the linking with the Urho3D library requires some extra linker flags. The only way to ensure downstream projects get these extra linker flags is to have the URHO3D_LUAJIT baked in. And while moving the bits for the extra linker flags I realized there is a refactoring opportunity to get rid of the `setup_macosx_linker_flags()`, `setup_ios_linker_flags()`, and `setup_emscripten_linker_flags()` macros. The `setup_macosx_linker_flags()` macro needs to be called explicitly by library users in the past when targeting OSX. After refactoring this is not needed anymore, i.e. the linker flags should be correctly configured for all the supported platforms without user intervention. It also takes care the LuaJIT specific linker flags automatically as mentioned earlier.\n\nOther than the above, the branch also:\n- Rename `cmake_macosx.sh` script to `cmake_xcode.sh` so it is more consistent with the other script names which are based on generator name.\n- Rename \"Emscripten\" platform to \"Web\" platform.\n- Enable GCC color diagnostics when it is supported (GCC 4.9.1+).\n- Fix the generic batch file and shell script to propagate out the exit code from CMake.\n\nI think the branch is now ready to be merged into master branch. Let me know if there are any objections.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1138","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1138/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1138/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1138/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1138","id":124997114,"number":1138,"title":"undefined

RPI CI jobs have been configured to run using 4 worker process (i.e. -j4 when using Makefile generator) and it caused the intermittent build failure. Mostly success but lately the frequency of failure increases for some reasons. I have experimented to reduce the number to 3 thinking that it should make the build more stable. To my surprise, 5 out of 6 RPI CI jobs failed the build test. It looks like the change actually aggravates the issue and makes it more reproducible instead. But why?

One of my classes relies on a custom collision-detection setup, and even creating raw btCollisionShapes for that fails. Creating a `btBoxShape` using the following code: \n\n```\n            btCylinderShape* cyl = new btCylinderShape(ToBtVector3(size_ * 0.5f));\n            URHO3D_LOGERROR(\"Cylinder: \" + String(size_ * 0.5f) + \" -> \" + String(ToVector3(cyl->getHalfExtentsWithoutMargin())) + \" / \" + String(ToVector3(cyl->getHalfExtentsWithMargin())));\n            cyl->setLocalScaling(ToBtVector3(newWorldScale));\n```\n\nThe `size_` variable is correct, but the returned half extents are both `-inf, 0, 0`. This was working perfectly until my latest pull. This combined with other people noting Bullet-related issues recently leads me to believe there's a big bug(s) that just popped up with Urho3D's use of Bullet.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1134/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1133","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1133/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1133/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1133/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1133","id":124812662,"number":1133,"title":"Destroing scene in a HandleNodeCollision","user":{"login":"1vanK","id":13021826,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13021826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK","html_url":"https://github.com/1vanK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038073,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/wontfix","name":"wontfix","color":"ffffff","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/6","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/6/labels","id":1933969,"number":6,"title":"1.6","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":444,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-08-10T03:15:59Z","updated_at":"2017-07-23T10:49:18Z","due_on":"2016-08-08T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-08-10T03:29:24Z"},"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-01-04T18:32:10Z","updated_at":"2016-08-10T03:25:04Z","closed_at":"2016-01-04T20:02:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"When a player arrives to the finish point\n\n```\nvoid LevelLogic::HandleNodeCollision(StringHash eventType, VariantMap& eventData)\n{\n    using namespace NodeCollision;\n    RigidBody* body = static_cast<RigidBody*>(eventData[P_BODY].GetPtr());\n    RigidBody* otherBody = static_cast<RigidBody*>(eventData[P_OTHERBODY].GetPtr());\n    Node* otherNode = static_cast<Node*>(eventData[P_OTHERNODE].GetPtr());\n    bool trigger = eventData[P_TRIGGER].GetBool();\n    VectorBuffer contacts = eventData[P_CONTACTS].GetBuffer();\n    Vector3 pos = contacts.ReadVector3(); // Buffer containing position (Vector3), normal (Vector3), distance (float), impulse (float) for each contact\n\n    if (trigger && otherNode->GetName() == \"Finish\")\n    {\n        NextLevel();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nthe game load next level and set it as current (I no longer need to be stored in the memory old scene).

have a projectile node prefab with a rigid body. Using InstanceXML, they spawn at the world origin and it seems to take them a frame (physics?) before they move to the correct position.\n\nInside the function that spawns the projectile, after instancing the node its position is correct:\n\n```\nvoid fire_projectile(...)\n{\n    // Instance the prefab\n    XMLFile@ xml = cache.GetResource(\"XMLFile\", \"Objects/\" + prefab + \".xml\");\n    // ...\n    auto@ node = scene.InstantiateXML(xml, position, rotation);\n    Print(\"node: \" + node.worldPosition.ToString());    // correct position\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nThough when I inspect the node position from a \"Projectile\" ScriptObject, I noticed that the node is at (0,0,0), while the body is at the correct position:\n\n```\nclass Projectile : ScriptObject\n{\n    void DelayedStart()\n    {\n        Print(\"start: \" + node.worldPosition.ToString());   // 0,0,0\n        Print(\"start body: \" + body.position.ToString());   // correct position\n    }\n}\n```\n\nProjectiles can be seen at the world origin. In the case of rocket projectiles, if they spawn straight into collision they will explode at the world origin.\nExample video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9om6S8XMYBk\n\nNote that the fire_projectile() print appears before the DelayedStart() print.\n\nvsync seems to make this problem disappear.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1127","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1127/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1127/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1127/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1127","id":124224749,"number":1127,"title":"Transfer

commit of updating to SDL 2.0.4, I recommend not to pull this in just yet, just keep this here for safe-keeping so there's no duplicate work later once 2.0.4 is stable.\n\nThis is based on this revision:\nhttps://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/file/734c90ea9990\n\nThe reasoning behind this is I wanted GLES 3.1 context-creation which has been patched for 2.0.4, but instead of just grabbing the latest EGL-related code I just dumped the latest SDL 2.0.4 on top and brought back the Urho3D-specific changes on top, except for a few which seem to be fixed or the code-base differs greatly. Some things like hard-code disable of the emulated mouse for Android has been omitted, as there's now a way to set this using a hint (haven't patched or tried this yet). Also some iOS 8 'hack' has been omitted as the code-base differs also.\n\nAlso changed the SDL_SendKeyboardKey function so the 'raw' keycode is called raw instead of keycode (the function now uses this variable name for something else internally). And I also patched the backends which didn't have this modification.\n\nAs always, test this code first (I haven't got every platform to test this against).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1123/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1122","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1122/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1122/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1122/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1122","id":123961760,"number":1122,"title":"HasSubscribedToEvent
