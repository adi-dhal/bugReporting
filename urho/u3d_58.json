I have a server and client script. Clients can connect (as many as you want) to the server and walk around. But after a client disconnects the next person (and every client after that) to join has some seriously weird physics stuff going on (jittering up and down and sometimes slowly phasing through the ground). Heres a gyazo gif/mp4 http://gyazo.com/94caa1e0461ca0519e7a1ea3e7368c54 of this in action (just the jittering, I recommend watching the MP4 opposed to the GIF as its much smoother). One of the strange things is that once the player moves or rotates the camera the player snaps back to the correct place. This leads me to think that it has something to do with networking? I can post both source files if needed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/424/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/423","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/423/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/423/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/423/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/423","id":40229610,"number":423,"title":"UI Menu cannot hide when click others","user":{"login":"IndieDeveloper","id":7589721,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7589721?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IndieDeveloper","html_url":"https://github.com/IndieDeveloper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IndieDeveloper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IndieDeveloper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IndieDeveloper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IndieDeveloper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IndieDeveloper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IndieDeveloper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IndieDeveloper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IndieDeveloper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IndieDeveloper/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/2/labels","id":593503,"number":2,"title":"1.32","description":null,"creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":278,"state":"closed","created_at":"2014-03-11T04:43:07Z","updated_at":"2015-07-16T05:18:08Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2014-11-28T04:55:53Z"},"comments":5,"created_at":"2014-08-14T07:32:57Z","updated_at":"2014-11-28T04:52:41Z","closed_at":"2014-08-14T11:08:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When clicking other ui elements or emptiness, the opened menu cannot hide since either E_UIMOUSECLICK or E_FOCUSCHANGED event has received by this menu which is quite strange in the Editor.

Adds a mechanism for background loading resources. Call ResourceCache::BackgroundLoadResource() to use. Resource loading is now split into two virtual functions: BeginLoad(), which can run in a background thread, and EndLoad(), which always runs in the main thread and for example uploads GPU data.\n- Scene::LoadAsync() and LoadAsyncXML() have been expanded to support background preloading the scene's resources first, and also a mode where only the resources are loaded, but not the scene content itself. This can be used to preload resources from an object prefab to ensure fast instantiation later.\n- Improvements for threading. Log messages are supported from outside main thread, using the Profiler becomes a safe no-op, while sending events & ResourceCache::GetResouce() log errors if attempted from outside the main thread.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/410","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/410/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/410/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/410/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/410","id":38610515,"number":410,"title":"Wrong
