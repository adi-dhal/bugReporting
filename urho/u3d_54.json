to address issues raised in #521, this allows a Sound Type to be defined via a StringHash or the old enum style and preserves loading the old enum style (but will not serialize it again in the future if the scene is exported).\n\nEditor support added for managed Audio Master Gains. For user defined ones they ui element can be dragged onto a line edit to set the underlying string hash value into that field.\n\nIn addition to this allows Cursor Shapes to be defined in a similar manner while preserving the enum for UI, sdl and backwards compatibility (except in cases where GetShape is used as that no longer returns a CursorShape). However serialization has been refactored and is no longer backwards compatible, for example it now looks like:\n\n```\n            <variant type=\"VariantVector\" >\n                <variant type=\"String\" value=\"Busy\" />\n                <variant type=\"ResourceRef\" value=\"Image;Textures/UI.png\" />\n                <variant type=\"IntRect\" value=\"128 64 148 85\" />\n

Thus, we need to find an alternative way in the meantime.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/536/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/535","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/535/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/535/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/535/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/535","id":49529193,"number":535,"title":"Number of CPUs not implemented on Android","user":{"login":"jonnenauha","id":157519,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/157519?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnenauha","html_url":"https://github.com/jonnenauha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnenauha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnenauha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnenauha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnenauha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnenauha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnenauha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnenauha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnenauha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnenauha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038070,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/2/labels","id":593503,"number":2,"title":"1.32","description":null,"creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":278,"state":"closed","created_at":"2014-03-11T04:43:07Z","updated_at":"2015-07-16T05:18:08Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2014-11-28T04:55:53Z"},"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-11-20T10:57:23Z","updated_at":"2014-11-28T04:54:44Z","closed_at":"2014-11-20T12:51:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This would be nice to have.

have refactored the work i have done, this time following every guideline i have been told:\n- Each commit includes changes to only one library.\n- Every time a library is being refactored, the first commit is for moving the files, the second commit is for changing code.\n\nI have checked that there is no regression in any commit, it appears that the code is built on top of the very latest Urho3D version, as opposed to last time (Alex pointed me to some code being reverted by my changes, probably because of my editor settings... Still a mistery for me.).\n\nOnly the kNet source code is changed. A few files from the SDL are also changed, but most of them were generated from the SDL ./configure step, which means that they should be automatically reflecting those changes the next time a new version of the SDL is merged to Urho3D.\n\nAn ultimate change i have done is to allow all headers from Bullet to be installed in the SDK (As opposed to the vanilla version of Urho3D, which only installs the LinearMath headers). This is to allow programmers to use the whole Bullet environment since the library is statically linked, all symbols are present in Urho3D lib. This could be easily reverted if needed.\n\nThe result (After running make package) is a self-contained SDK that only requires one include path (SDKPath/include/Urho3D) instead of many.\n\nPlease tell me if everything fits.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/523","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/523/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/523/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/523/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/523","id":48603550,"number":523,"title":"\"Released\" event handler 'triggered' with spacebar","user":{"login":"Mike3D","id":6427048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6427048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mike3D","html_url":"https://github.com/Mike3D","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mike3D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mike3D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mike3D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mike3D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mike3D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mike3D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mike3D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mike3D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mike3D/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038073,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/wontfix","name":"wontfix","color":"ffffff","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/2/labels","id":593503,"number":2,"title":"1.32","description":null,"creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":278,"state":"closed","created_at":"2014-03-11T04:43:07Z","updated_at":"2015-07-16T05:18:08Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2014-11-28T04:55:53Z"},"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-11-13T06:46:21Z","updated_at":"2014-11-28T04:54:44Z","closed_at":"2014-11-13T09:14:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Currently experiencing very strange behavior with \"Released\" event 'triggered' when pressing space bar.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nIn 02_HelloGUI.lua, add these lines at the end of InitControls() function:\n\n```\nlocal newbutton = ui.root:CreateChild(\"Button\")\nnewbutton:SetSize(200, 200)\nSubscribeToEvent(newbutton, \"Released\", \"HandleNewButton\")\n```\n\nThen create this function:\n\n```\nfunction HandleNewButton(eventType, eventData)\n    print(\"NewButton Clicked\")\nend\n```\n\nNow, after clicking on the new button, pressing spacebar will always trigger the HandleNewButton() function.
