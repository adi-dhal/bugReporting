posted on http://urho3d.prophpbb.com/post10432.html#p10432\n\nIn Renderer::Update() this code suppose to ensure that the viewport with the lowest index is rendered first, since it says rendering order is also reverse (from size to 0, so last element is rendered first).\n\n``` C++\n// Queue update of the main viewports. Use reverse order, as rendering order is also reverse\n// to render auxiliary views before dependant main views\nfor (unsigned i = viewports_.Size() - 1; i < viewports_.Size(); --i)\n    QueueViewport(0, viewports_[i]);\n```\n\nviewports_ is private and Renderer::SetViewport() is the only function that adds elements to it. That means that only viewports that are added with Renderer::SetViewport() are ordered.\n\nRenderer::QueueViewport() adds the viewport with its render target to queuedViewports_ .\n\nRenderSurface::QueueUpdate() calls Renderer::QueueRenderSurface() which directly uses Renderer::QueueViewport(). That means RenderSurface::QueueUpdate() isn't added to viewports_ and therefore skips the viewport ordering.\nThat means it would be at the beginning of queuedViewports_, that means it renders after all of the elements in viewports_ because of the reveresed order.\n\nA possible solution would be to collect all the render surface viewports in Renderer::QueueRenderSurface(), and push them to queuedViewports_ in Renderer::Update() only after the main views are added, so they're rendered first.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1170","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1170/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1170/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1170/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1170","id":128670077,"number":1170,"title":"C89 compliance in SDL_windowsevents.c when compiling under MSVC2012","user":{"login":"TheComet","id":3390890,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3390890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheComet","html_url":"https://github.com/TheComet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheComet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheComet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheComet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheComet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheComet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheComet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheComet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheComet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheComet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/6","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/6/labels","id":1933969,"number":6,"title":"1.6","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":444,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-08-10T03:15:59Z","updated_at":"2017-07-23T10:49:18Z","due_on":"2016-08-08T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-08-10T03:29:24Z"},"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-01-25T23:11:43Z","updated_at":"2016-08-10T03:21:34Z","closed_at":"2016-01-26T15:32:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/pulls/1170","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1170","diff_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1170.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1170.patch"},"body":"The error message is:\n\n```\nerror C2275: 'SDL_Mouse' : illegal use of this type as an expression SDL_windowsevents.c    426    1    SDL\n```\n\nThis happens because MSVC will compile all `*.c` files using the C compiler in C89 mode, meaning all variables must be declared at the beginning of each scope.

Not sure how long in AppVeyor. This is not good in two ways.\n1. The CI job waits for 10 minutes for nothing when it can actually move on and use the valuable slot for starting other CI jobs.
