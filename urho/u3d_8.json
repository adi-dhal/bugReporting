to remove use of the term URI to reduce confusions where this proposal fails to conform to the standards for URIs._\r\n\r\nProposal for Urho's Path. I was looking for comments on it before I really start work. I think I'll try implementing it, but I don't know exactly how hard it will be, so I'm not certain how far I'll get...\r\n\r\nThis is bassed off of the discussion in issue #1866\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not really sure how the // should be handled after the scheme -- forbid it, allow it and treat it as just a single slash, remove it and only have the path start with a / if there were three slashes (like file:///home/... in Chrome)...\r\n\r\n# Path:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Scheme:][Path][%SubFile][?Query][#Fragment]\r\n```\r\nAll are case sensitive\r\n\r\n * ~~It is my opinion that we should actually switch the fragment and the query locations, so as to allow the fragment to be used to access resource pack internals and such. Basically I want to invert how true URIs are parsed. # will be used to 'look inside' a resource pak file (in part because # looks more like /) and represents new pages to load, while the query would be sent to the already loaded resource as a request for it to change its behavior (or clone itself and return the clone, e.g. Material.xml?MatEnvMapColor=FEED would return a clone of the material with the MatEnvMapColor set to the requested color). In accordance with this, I propose switching the position of the fragment and query as well.~~ (also removed the unnecessary and improper # from before the color)\r\n * **SubFile proposal:** Another proposal I have would be to allow another delimeter, perhaps one of the following, to be used to look inside a resource pak.:\r\n\r\n    % ~ @ ; > + | $ /#/ [File/Path.file] &lt;File/Path.file> \r\n    \r\n     * Path/To/Res.pak@File/Path.file, where @ is one of the delimeters (my prefered is %)\r\n     * Path/To/Res.pak[File/Path.file] where [] are one of the matching delimeters\r\n     * Perhaps allow a user-specified delimeter, and just choose a default one (my favored is one of the first three appearance wise, or /#/ parsing wise, though it does mean the fragment should not start with /\r\n\r\n## Scheme\r\n\r\n```\r\nregex: ([^?#:]*):\r\n```\r\n\r\nScheme may not contain ? or # (the former, at least, is not generally liked on filesystems) and in both cases this makes it such that a querry or a fragment will have priority in claiming the : so that a schemeless path with colon in query or fragment will be interpreted correctly\r\n\r\nUnlike proper URIs, slashes are allowed (e.g. Data/Save0:)\r\n\r\nEmpty Scheme is allowed (\":Path\").\r\n\r\n * Should \":Path\" differ from \"Path\"? <br> -- Possibly, it could be used to convey certain information about whether to use the resource cache or not...\r\n\r\n## Query\r\n\r\n```\r\nregex: \\?([^#]*)\r\n```\r\n\r\nQuery begins with ? and may not contain # which begins the fragment\r\n\r\nEmpty Query is allowed (\"Path?\" or \"Path?#Fragment\").\r\n\r\n * Should \"Path\" differ from \"Path?\"? -- Probably not\r\n\r\n\r\n## Fragment\r\n```\r\nregex: #(.*)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFragment begins with the first # and continues through the rest of the path. Use for resources that will not need to be reloaded, perhaps. I would say use for accessing resources in package files, as someone else suggested\r\n\r\n## SubFile\r\n\r\nIf my proposal is accepted for a different delimeter, then the subpath will extend from the delimeter to the start of the query, fragment, or end of the request, whichever comes first.\r\n\r\nIf it is not accepted, SubFile would not be a part of the path\r\n\r\nSubfiles that begin after a / should be interpreted as just part of the path, with the subfile delimeter stripped (I think)\r\n\r\n## Path\r\n\r\n```\r\nregex: ([^?#]*)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPath may not contain ? or # (the former, at least, is not generally liked on filesystems) and in both cases this makes it such that a querry or a fragment will have priority in claiming the trailing slashes, if needed\r\n\r\nIf my proposal is accepted for SubFile, then the Path must also exclude that character\r\n\r\nPaths should follow unix-style conventions (i.e. forward slash) and to allow compatability with Window's drive letters, an option should be added to treat all single letter schemes as drive letters.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Relative Paths:\r\n\r\n\r\nA path will be deemed potentially relative if it contains /./ or /../ or ends with /. or \r\n\r\nPotentially relative paths should be evaluated to see if they are truly relative, stripping the previous directory with /../ and replacing all /./ with / and trailing /. with / (yes, this will prevent folders/files from being named \".\", but it seems more convenient this way. If the path then begins with ../ from the replacements, it will be deemed definitively relative.\r\n\r\nA path will be deemed definitively relative if it begins with ./ or ../ or if it is solely . or ..\r\n\r\nIf the path contains a subfile and an empty base the path is definitively relative\r\n\r\n\r\n## Relative Path Evaluation\r\nRelative paths must be evalueated against an absolute base path. This base path should be supplied when the resource is requested, or the present working directory will be used.\r\n\r\n### Scheme Resoultion\r\nIf no scheme is provided by the relative path, the scheme will resolve to that of the base path and fall back to the resource chache/file system (no scheme or scheme file: or scheme cache: (TBD: which of these it will be))\r\n\r\nIf a scheme is provided by the relative path, that scheme will replace the scheme of the base path. According to an option in the ResourceCache/FileSystem, it will fallback to the default scheme (:, file:, cache: depending on what was chosen above)\r\n\r\n**TODO:** Decide on what happens if you request \"Data:../Techniques/Diff.xml\"\r\n\r\n * Should it evaluate to Data/Data.pak's folder/Techniques/Diff.xml\r\n * Or perhaps just \"Data:Techniques/Diff.xml\" (prevent relative paths from going outside of the scheme)\r\n\r\n### Subfile Resolution\r\nSubfiles should evaluate the same way as a path if the resource pak had been used as a scheme\r\n\r\nI.E. \"file:Path/To/Data.pak%Materials/StoneMat.xml\" should be equivalent to \"Data:Materials/StoneMat.xml\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Path Resoulution\r\nThe path should be appended to the base's path and then .. and . replacements should be made as needed. Traversal up past the root directory should not be allowed, but I think it should try to succeed by treating, e.g. /../../usr/ as just /usr/ (using Unix-style paths).\r\n\r\nIf the base path contains a path and a subfile and the relative path contains only a path, it should be interpreted as being a subfile instead of a path, appended to the base's SubFile portion and then absolutized.\r\n\r\nIf the base path contains a path and a subfile and the relative path contains only a subfile, it should be appended to see if it can be evalueated as a secondary subfile and if not it should replace the base path's subfile.\r\n\r\n * I think this should be impossible -- I feel the subfile should be viewed as just a path if there is no path\r\n\r\nIf the base path contains only a path and the relative path contains [optionally a path and] a subfile, the realtive path  [Path+]SubFileshould be appended to the base path path and evaluated accordingly\r\n\r\nIf the base path contains only a subfile, it should be viewed as a base Path with no subfile instead.\r\n\r\n**TODO:** What about second-level subfiles (i.e. ResourcePaks inside ResourcePaks)?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fragment Resolution\r\nIf my proposal for using a different delimeter (i.e. SubFile proposal) for resource pak extraction is accepted, the fragment should behave like an HTML fragment -- the resource will be loaded, then the FragmentRequest will be made, which will be allowed to return an Object (or void* or Variant) so as to allow requesting e.g. a Patch from a Terrain or maybe an XMLElement from an XMLFile, but the return need not be used (it could be used to, e.g. focus the UI on a spot like in actual web pages)\r\n\r\nIn this case two more sets of methods should be added to the ResourceCache:\r\n * template&lt;T> Pair&lt;T,FragmentReturn> GetResourceAndFragment(Path) // loads the resource, calls the FragmentRequest(String Fragment) and returns it with the resource\r\n * template&lt;T> Pair&lt;SharedPtr&lt;T>,FragmentReturn> GetTempResourceAndFragment(Path) // loads the resource as temporary, calls the FragmentRequest(String Fragment) and returns it with the resource\r\n * FragmentReturn GetFragment(Path) // will load resource\r\n * FragmentReturn GetTempFragment(Path) // will load temporary resource and return it's fragment. *Generally unsafe*, as the resource will be deleted before the return of the method, but if the FragmentReturn is a value type it could potentially be okay\r\n\r\nIf my proposal for switching the behavior of fragments and queries is accepted instead:\r\n\r\nFragments should not be stripped from the base path if the relative path does not contain a fragment\r\n\r\nOtherwise:\r\n\r\nFragments should be stripped from the base resource (following html-style provisions)\r\n\r\n### Query Resolution\r\nIf my proposal for using a different delimeter (i.e. SubFile proposal) for resource pak extraction is accepted, the query should behave like an HTML query, sort of -- the resource will be loaded, and then a QueryRequest will be made that should return a 'copy' of the resource with a different name, parameters changed as needed. The return is required, unlike with the FragmentRequest, and the return of the ResourceCache's GetResource will be that of the QueryRequest.\r\n\r\n**TODO:** Decide what must be done for storing SharedPtrs to the resource, given that multiple queries could be but are not necessarily equivalent -- e.g. \"Material.xml?UOffset=1 0 0 0&VOffset=0 1 0 0\" should be identical to \"Material.xml?VOffset=0 1 0 0&UOffset=1 0 0 0\", if you ask me.\r\n\r\n//If my proposal for switching the behavior of fragments and queries is accepted:\r\n\r\n//Queries should be stripped from the base path like html\r\n\r\n//Otherwise:\r\n\r\n//Queries should not be stripped from the base resource (following html-style provisions)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Proposed Default Schemes\r\n\r\n### file\r\nUsed for FileSystem requests. Relative path . by default would be evaluated relative to the present working directory\r\n\r\nBy default case insensitive\r\n\r\n\r\n### cache\r\nUsed for ResourceCache requests. Relative path . by default would refer to the root of the resource cache folders. It should search through all the resource cache folders like GetResource does now (so GetResource(Path(\"file.xml\")) and GetResource(Path(\"./file.xml\")) should be equivalent).\r\n\r\nBy default case insensitive\r\n\r\n### ResourceDirs (e.g. Data, CoreData)\r\nI feel that teh default ResourceDirs should be added by default.\r\n\r\nIt is my opinion that, by default, adding a resource directory should add that as a Scheme based on the last folder in the directory path (e.g. /Path/To/Data would be added as Data) and the resource paks as the name without the extension (e.g. /Path/To/Data.1.pak as Data.1). A different scheme should be permitted, however, so as to allow /Mods/Mod0/Resources/ to be added as something specific, such as Mod0 or as Mod0/Resources.\r\n\r\nBy default case sensitive\r\n\r\n### http(s)\r\n\r\nNetwork requests, disabled by default (security) and disabled completely if Networking was not built with Urho. Possibly don't include and just let this be handled as networking is currently handled\r\n\r\nBy default case insensitive","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1913/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1912","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1912/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1912/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1912/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1912","id":222137694,"number":1912,"title":"Trouble from viewport to image file","user":{"login":"vivienneanthony","id":3378677,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3378677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vivienneanthony","html_url":"https://github.com/vivienneanthony","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vivienneanthony/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vivienneanthony/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vivienneanthony/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vivienneanthony/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vivienneanthony/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vivienneanthony/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vivienneanthony/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vivienneanthony/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vivienneanthony/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038073,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/wontfix","name":"wontfix","color":"ffffff","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-04-17T13:58:56Z","updated_at":"2017-04-19T13:25:28Z","closed_at":"2017-04-19T13:24:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi\r\n\r\nThis is quick.

This happens\r\nwhen btRaycastVehicle.h is included, so I had to reimplement RaycastVehicle class using\r\nopaque data, so no bullet headers are included with RaycastVehicle.h.\r\n\r\nRemaining items (working on till weekend (till April 24)):\r\n\r\n- [x] Remove CMAKE option, build with URHO3D_PHYSICS\r\n- [x] Update AngelScript API to accomodate C++ changes\r\n- [x] Update Lua API to accomodate C++ changes\r\n- [x] Add Lua demo\r\n- [x] Improve encapsulation (should not require wheel node hand-manipulation\r\n- [x] Resolve motor wheels not rotating if no ground contact (Bullet behavior,\r\nbut it is very annoying)\r\n- [x] Fix save/load crash\r\n- [x] Implement wheel dust in demo (use @Lumak offroad vehicle code for this)\r\n- [x] Move component code to physics subdirectory\r\n- [x] Check coding style consistency (is there some automatic tool?)\r\n\r\nWell, current wheel handling code is adequate. The problem might arise when simulating vehicles\r\nwith differentials, but I need to read more about this, but it could be implemented later.\r\nWheel blocking by brakes can be easily implemented outside the component, as it is only a few lines and not needed to be put in FixedUpdate. So I put this on post merge \"some time later\" schedule.\r\n\r\nSometimes later TODO:\r\n1. Block/slow down wheels on intense brakes (component code)\r\n2. Implement skids. (demo code)\r\n3. Implement side momentum (demo code)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1904/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":4,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1903","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1903/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1903/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1903/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1903","id":220807494,"number":1903,"title":"Bullet RaycastVehicle support","user":{"login":"slapin","id":6099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin","html_url":"https://github.com/slapin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038069,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":17,"created_at":"2017-04-11T00:34:15Z","updated_at":"2017-04-12T01:47:28Z","closed_at":"2017-04-11T15:34:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/pulls/1903","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1903","diff_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1903.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1903.patch"},"body":"Hi!\r\n\r\nThis is initial release of RaycastVehicle component, which is wrapping of Bullet btRaycastVehicle.\r\n\r\nMany features are missing, which will be added later.\r\nThe commit contains C++ code and AngelScript + Lua binding.

Also I plan to do general cleanup.\r\n\r\nThis video demonstrates abilities: https://youtu.be/LKjzcN3s65Y\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1903/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1902","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1902/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1902/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1902/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1902","id":220492260,"number":1902,"title":"Export some consts to AngelScript","user":{"login":"1vanK","id":13021826,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13021826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK","html_url":"https://github.com/1vanK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038070,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-04-09T19:21:17Z","updated_at":"2017-05-27T04:19:43Z","closed_at":"2017-04-10T18:02:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/pulls/1902","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1902","diff_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1902.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1902.patch"},"body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1902/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1901","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1901/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1901/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1901/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1901","id":220472732,"number":1901,"title":"Populate a newly created rapidjson-value before adding it to the parent.","user":{"login":"ombre5733","id":4263348,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4263348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ombre5733","html_url":"https://github.com/ombre5733","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ombre5733/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ombre5733/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ombre5733/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ombre5733/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ombre5733/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ombre5733/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ombre5733/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ombre5733/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ombre5733/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038070,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-04-09T13:56:17Z","updated_at":"2017-04-09T16:29:48Z","closed_at":"2017-04-09T16:11:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/pulls/1901","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1901","diff_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1901.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1901.patch"},"body":"When converting JSONValue to rapidsjon::Value, create the array elements and\r\nobject properties fully before adding them to rapidjson.
