The specular and ambient light is disabled.\nWhen I import this model and material in my Urho3D scene it shows a **wrong color**.\n\nWhat should I change to get the **exact(!) color code** from Urho3D as I set **in my material**?\n\nMy (only) light is a directional light facing down with a brightness of 1, color white and alpha 1.\nDistance between camera and plane (cube) doesn't change anything. I think the directional light does not have a position, right?\n\nIn this image you can see my target color (left) and the color I get from my scene (right).\n![002 coloroffset](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9771909/17871166/b1e297f0-68ba-11e6-80e5-1b412c813604.png)\n\nThe exact color codes are:\n- Current: #CBA480 (R: 203, G: 164, B: 128)\n- Target: #DDC9B4 (R: 221, G: 201, B: 180)\n\nI hope someone can help me, Simon :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1532","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1532/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1532/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1532/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1532","id":172469131,"number":1532,"title":"added a feature to suppress $fbx nodes in assetImporter","user":{"login":"Lumak","id":14249868,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/14249868?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lumak","html_url":"https://github.com/Lumak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lumak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lumak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lumak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lumak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lumak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lumak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lumak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lumak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lumak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038070,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-08-22T14:37:13Z","updated_at":"2016-08-23T01:13:43Z","closed_at":"2016-08-22T18:39:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/pulls/1532","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1532","diff_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1532.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1532.patch"},"body":"If an fbx model contains non-reset bone transforms (non-zero or having pivot point) it will generate multiple $AssimpFbx$ nodes per bone.

problem always existed as far as I can remember, and I used to work around it by using the direction between the nodes instead of the contact normal (which aren't the same).\n\nWhen I reload a level (first load is consistent AFAIR) sometimes the normals of contacts flip. It only happens after reloading a level, possibly because the order of the bodies changes.\n\nIn `Urho3D::PhysicsWorld::SendCollisionEvents()` the order of the bodies A and B may be flipped to ensure unique pairs, so original A becomes new B and original B becomes new A, but the contactManifold's points' `m_normalWorldOnB` stays the same, and later on when collision event's contacts_ is populated it handles the normals according to the new A & B while the normals are according to the original A & B.\n\nThe contact points' normals can't be flipped directly because it seems Bullet still uses them (tried that and it caused bodies to wiggle).\nA possible solution is to track if the order of the bodies was flipped, and take that into account when populating the event data's contacts_ by flipping the normals too (tried it and it worked).\n\nAlso, does Bullet generate duplicate contactManifolds? If it doesn't it may be possible to avoid using a HashMap for the purpose of iteration, thus needing to reorder the bodies, and that would be a more efficient solution.\nI do see that the HashMap is used for lookup to check if a previousCollisions_ ended.\n\nA simple alternative way to do that is to use both a vector for iteration, and a HashMap for checking against previous collisions, which would be possibly faster too.\n\nA better is to send the events from inside the contactManifolds loop and using the original A & B bodies, removing the need to iterate over the HashMap all together, which is also faster.\nI tried it with my project and some of the Urho samples and it seems to work fine, suggesting Bullet doesn't generate duplicate manifolds.\nThis is the solution in this pull request (this post was originally written as an issue).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1521/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1520","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1520/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1520/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1520/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1520","id":171283208,"number":1520,"title":"replaced
