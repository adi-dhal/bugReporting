not sure if `if (dest.IsNull())` check is necessary in `bool Serializable::SaveJSON(JSONValue& dest) const`. It could be copied from SaveXML method by mistake. One has to assign a dummy object to the JSONFile root in order to use SaveJSON() method, because it returns false otherwise.\nAlso possibly code could be changed so that JSONFile acts more similarly to XMLFile, allowing to set the default node name.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1264","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1264/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1264/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1264/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1264","id":142082495,"number":1264,"title":"Editor:

I am a Linux user and has been spoiled with yum/dnf/apt package managers which can automatically use the nearest mirror based on GeoIP. From what you have described it appears that choco still has long way to go. Anyway, is it too much to ask to have some of their commonly used packages to be hosted locally by AppVeyor in such a way that it is transparent to user, i.e. the script still uses `choco install whatever` as per usual? If that is not possible then we have to think of other ways on our side. Having a binary build artifact in one of our source code repository would be last resort.\n> \n> Best regards,\n> YaoWT\n> \n> > On Fri, Mar 18, 2016 at 6:39 AM, Feodor Fitsner feodor@appveyor.com wrote:\n> > That's absolutely possible there could be networking issue of any sort. For instance, if you look at install.ps1 script for doxygen: https://chocolatey.org/packages/doxygen.portable - you'll see it's pulling a zip from the server located in Netherlands. It should be \"OK\" when the server is located overseas, however there could be increased latency or varying connection speed between AppVeyor VMs (Central US) and those servers. I even remember the case when a library was being downloaded from a server under .edu domain and after X successful downloads it started throwing something like \"your IP has been blocked because of high download activity\".\n> > \n> > Both doxygen and graphviz are \"portable\" libraries meaning there are just .zip archives without installers.

I don't have a way to actually log the error message and measure the time that it took before returning the non-zero exit code. But my guess is, it was network error and the process got time-out. You see, we actually do a very tight while-loop to keep reinstalling until the exit code is zero (success). In each iteration we echo out a status line stating \"installing .....\". The number of status lines message in the build job should be huge if the while-loop iterates in fast rate, since this is not the case so I guess this was what has happened. I am sorry that this is what I can provide right now.

We have used a brute force logic in our script to keep installing until it succeed. Although this works, the time it takes to just get ready is too long. This did not happen just once or twice in the past. So, why it needs multiple attempt to get the software installed? Do we something wrong here? I believe doxygen + graphviz installation requirement should be quite common.\n> > > > > \n> > > > > Best regards,\n> > > > > YaoWT\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1255/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1254","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1254/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1254/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1254/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1254","id":141723912,"number":1254,"title":"Building issues persist on MinGW-w64 with D3D9 and D3D11","user":{"login":"JTippetts","id":5596061,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5596061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JTippetts","html_url":"https://github.com/JTippetts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JTippetts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JTippetts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JTippetts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JTippetts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JTippetts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JTippetts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JTippetts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JTippetts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JTippetts/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true},{"id":301786971,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/build%20system","name":"build system","color":"5319e7","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/6","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/6/labels","id":1933969,"number":6,"title":"1.6","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":444,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-08-10T03:15:59Z","updated_at":"2017-07-23T10:49:18Z","due_on":"2016-08-08T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-08-10T03:29:24Z"},"comments":25,"created_at":"2016-03-17T22:35:55Z","updated_at":"2016-08-10T03:24:45Z","closed_at":"2016-03-19T11:31:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Updated to the latest to get weitjong's commit to fix the MinGW build, but still having problems.\n\nCMake Error at CMake/Modules/FindDirectX.cmake:83 (message):\n  Could not find MinGW system root.

can use the sound type system to stop specific sounds, instead of all sounds or manually selected sounds.\nUse case: When opening a menu and the game pauses, pause in-game sound effects only, while still allowing music and UI sound effects.\nNote it's important to pause and not mute, so if the game was stopped while playing a sound that sound will resume.\n\nPossible approach:\nEither replace `Audio::masterGain_` with a general sound type map (`Audio::soundTypes_`), or make a new map for stop sound types if there's any reason not to have a single map.\n\nFunctions:\n\n``` C++\nAudio::Stop(const String& type);\nAudio::Play(const String& type);\n```\n\nCould work like `Audio::SetMasterGain()`, iterating over the sound sources and updating them.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1249","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1249/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1249/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1249/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1249","id":141163906,"number":1249,"title":"Engine
