This adds an additional optional parameter to to SubscribeToEvent in the following manner:\n\n```\nSubscribeToEvent(\"Update\",\"HandleUpdate\");\nSubscribeToEvent(\"Update\",\"HandleUpdate\",@this);\nSubscribeToEvent(\"Update\",\"HandleUpdate\",@foo);\n\nSubscribeToEvent(object,\"Update\",\"HandleUpdate\");\nSubscribeToEvent(object,\"Update\",\"HandleUpdate\",@this);\nSubscribeToEvent(object,\"Update\",\"HandleUpdate\",@foo);\n```\n\nThis required a change to how we store the pointer to the ScriptInstance class, since the object user data pointer is lost when moving between script classes, the pointer to the listener for ScriptInstance was moved to asIScriptContext UserData instead.\n\nThis allowed another change that means a ScriptFile can now handle SubscribeToEvent from inside a pure script class to depend on whether that asIScriptContext UserData pointer is null or not. However a ScriptFile must specify this optional parameter or it will look for a method outside the object, whereas the ScriptInstance will still fall back on its original asIScriptObject.\n\n---\n\nThis seems to be working on my tests with both ScriptFile and ScriptInstance but I wouldn't be against some more rigorous testing (by myself and others) before merging, I just wanted to get the code up for inspection and suggestions on anything that might need further work.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/99","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/99/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/99/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/99/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/99","id":24892423,"number":99,"title":"\"urho3d.h\" not found","user":{"login":"codec-abc","id":1208646,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1208646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codec-abc","html_url":"https://github.com/codec-abc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codec-abc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codec-abc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codec-abc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codec-abc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codec-abc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codec-abc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codec-abc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codec-abc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codec-abc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038071,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"e6e6e6","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/1/labels","id":590529,"number":1,"title":"1.31","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":216,"state":"closed","created_at":"2014-03-07T14:42:58Z","updated_at":"2014-03-07T14:52:11Z","due_on":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2014-03-07T14:52:11Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2013-12-30T17:26:39Z","updated_at":"2014-03-07T14:47:15Z","closed_at":"2013-12-30T19:23:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\nTrying to build urho3D on Ubuntu i got the following error:\n\nUnable to find \"urho3d.h\".

It cannot be resizable because a border is required for that and it can't be fullscreen because otherwise SDL sets the window in such a way it removes the point in being a borderless window. The default setting if no width or height is passed in is desktop resolution.\n\nThe second change is the ability to Maximize a window via code instead of needing to be resizable to do so. This also includes a change so that if width or height are 0 0 the window is maximized as the default (the old default of 1024 768 has been preserved for when a user un-maximizes a window).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/90/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/89","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/89/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/89/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/89/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/89","id":24829981,"number":89,"title":"ShaderParser slowdown with recent changes?","user":{"login":"JoshEngebretson","id":376203,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/376203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshEngebretson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038070,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/1/labels","id":590529,"number":1,"title":"1.31","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":216,"state":"closed","created_at":"2014-03-07T14:42:58Z","updated_at":"2014-03-07T14:52:11Z","due_on":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2014-03-07T14:52:11Z"},"comments":3,"created_at":"2013-12-27T18:58:12Z","updated_at":"2014-03-07T14:47:14Z","closed_at":"2013-12-28T00:37:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I am seeing some really long load times since rebasing to master.

GetFile and subsequently GetResource assume two things, that package files want to be searched first and that Resource Directories are always to be searched in the order that they are added. This is less true for Package files, since you can specify to add them to the front of the vector instead.\n\nWhat I propose is two fold. First there is a function similar to the following:\n\n```\nGetSubsystem<ResourceCache>()->SetSearchPackagesFirst(true);\n```\n\nWhich when calling GetFile or GetResource will use that flag to define which locations to search first, the default behaviour for this will be packages first.\n\nSecondly there is the ability to define the priority of resource directories and package files in this search process. To facilitate this a modification should be made with more granularity than Front or Back that will work along the following lines:\n\n```\nGetSubsystem<ResourceCache>()->AddResourceDirectory(\"Dir\");\nGetSubsystem<ResourceCache>()->AddResourceDirectory(\"Dir\",3);\n```\n\nWhere the first would default to the end of the list, and the second would be placed in the \"4\" spot in the list or at the end if the list is not that big.\n\n---\n\nI'm not totally sure whether this is suitable for widespread Urho, since my usage of it has some requirements for modability in my applications where mods can overwrite scripts that define certain aspects of the logic and so instead of keeping my own map of original name to overridden location I'd prefer to have the underlying resource cache able to do so for me.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/84/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/83","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/83/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/83/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/83/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/83","id":24660716,"number":83,"title":"Windows DPI scaling","user":{"login":"friesencr","id":105460,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/105460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr","html_url":"https://github.com/friesencr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/friesencr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038070,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/1/labels","id":590529,"number":1,"title":"1.31","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":216,"state":"closed","created_at":"2014-03-07T14:42:58Z","updated_at":"2014-03-07T14:52:11Z","due_on":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2014-03-07T14:52:11Z"},"comments":4,"created_at":"2013-12-21T05:52:41Z","updated_at":"2014-03-07T14:47:52Z","closed_at":"2013-12-22T19:35:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Crank up your dpi in windows.

The patch makes E and Q move up and down, as in Unity and UDK.  Following Blender, it makes the numeric keypad 1, 3, and 7 keys select front, side and top views.  (Again as in Blender, control with those keys selects the opposite view—back, left and bottom.)\n\nI also modified the code which tracks the camera's pitch and yaw, so it doesn't gimbal lock when you are facing straight up or straight down.  Of course there is a lot of personal preference in the way mouse look works, so I'll understand if you decide you are happy with the way it is now. :)\n\nThank you for your time developing Urho3D, and if you'd like to include these changes, please help yourself.

sensible.\n\nPete\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/75/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/74","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/74/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/74/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/74/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/74","id":24398977,"number":74,"title":"Mac

This line is inside a control block starting at Line 146 with the conditional if (NOT APPLE AND NOT MSVC) which results in cmake thinking that a MinGW build is a *nix build and trying to invoke mv instead of move as it should.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/73/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/72","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/72/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/72/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/72/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/72","id":24376331,"number":72,"title":"Allow Getting and Setting of Inner XML Text","user":{"login":"alexparlett","id":2347963,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2347963?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexparlett","html_url":"https://github.com/alexparlett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexparlett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexparlett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexparlett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexparlett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexparlett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexparlett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexparlett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexparlett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexparlett/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038070,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/1/labels","id":590529,"number":1,"title":"1.31","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":216,"state":"closed","created_at":"2014-03-07T14:42:58Z","updated_at":"2014-03-07T14:52:11Z","due_on":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2014-03-07T14:52:11Z"},"comments":2,"created_at":"2013-12-16T20:28:20Z","updated_at":"2014-07-05T20:05:00Z","closed_at":"2013-12-16T22:50:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/pulls/72","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/72","diff_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/72.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/72.patch"},"body":"I noticed when creating a settings file in xml and using the XML api, that there was no way to retrieve the inner text when a node was in the form.\n\n```\n<node>text</node> \n```\n\nThis adds that functionality as well as adding the ability to create an XMLElement in that format. It only adds getting for Lua though since unlike angelscript it doesn't seem to have the ability to use the Set functions for XML.
