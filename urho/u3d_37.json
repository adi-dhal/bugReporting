trying to migrate the Urho3D Sample Platformer to Urho3D 1.5+ https://github.com/gawag/Urho-Sample-Platformer/issues/12 I've noticed that it must now contend with the new means of handling resource prefix paths.  The Setup() function in Urho3D\\Source\\Samples\\Sample.inl has an example:\n\n```\n    // Construct a search path to find the resource prefix with two entries:\n    // The first entry is an empty path which will be substituted with program/bin directory -- this entry is for binary when it is still in build tree\n    // The second entry is a relative path from the installed program/bin directory to the asset directory -- this entry is for binary when it is in the Urho3D SDK installation location\n    if (!engineParameters_.Contains(\"ResourcePrefixPaths\"))\n        engineParameters_[\"ResourcePrefixPaths\"] = \";../share/Urho3D/Resources\";\n```\n\nThis code is borne as a solution to CMake build and installation problems.  It's not generally applicable to all possible uses of Urho3D, meaning, people who just use an Urho3D binary and aren't interested in using CMake for their own code.  That may sound like a corner case, but my point is the code is more about \"contending with CMake\" than using Urho3D.  Pedagogically, it would be easier for people to write simple code to get going with Urho3D, if they didn't have to worry about such things.\n\nThis could be accomplished by establishing a convention, that Urho3D will search the binary directory for resources _by default_.  The programmer could still alter this default behavior however he likes.  So, Urho3D would initialize ResourcePrefixPaths to \"\".  This eliminates the need for the following line:\n\n```\n    if (!engineParameters_.Contains(\"ResourcePrefixPaths\"))\n```\n\nas by default it will always contain that.  Then provide something like:\n\n```\nengineParameters_[\"ResourcePrefixPaths\"].Append(\"../share/Urho3D/Resources\")\n```\n\nor even more tersely\n\n```\nengineParameters_[\"ResourcePrefixPaths\"] += \"../share/Urho3D/Resources\"\n```\n\nif you like that sort of style.  I didn't look up whether engineParameters_ can do all those sorts of things, I figure you get the idea if it's relevant.\n\nThe pedagogical advantage is the user now has to do nothing if their code is simple and they didn't want to worry about installs, or if their install is simple and didn't need a parallel ../bin ../share style directory structure.  And if they do need to do something, they have to do less.\n\nI think the pedagogy is important to sustaining the ecology of a 3d engine.  Developers get _real bored_ of trying to keep up with engine changes _real quick_.  For instance the Urho3D Sample Platformer developer has pretty much fallen off the radar in recent weeks.  He made some changes for some earlier bugs I filed, but then when he saw the 1.5 difficulties he seemed to throw up his hands and vanish.  I've been hoping that showing what he needed to do to move the code forwards would keep him from giving up.  I myself have had to exercise a certain amount of discipline as I don't actually have his code working yet, just built.  I'm having to slug through those very CMake build issues I mentioned above, and I can see why most developers wouldn't relish the complications such build issues bring.\n\nA few years ago, I did a major inventory of the Ogre3D engine ecology.  They had listed numerous projects on their website that used their engine.  Well, as I worked through each and every last one of them, I found that the vast majority of them were bitrotted and abandoned.  I would say only 25% were actually viable as \"code I'd currently inflict on people I wanted to keep as friends.\"  I moved all their project descriptions around and put the abandoned projects on a sort of graveyard page.  I was trying to give them a bit of a marketing facelift so they'd be putting their best foot forwards, so that code / projects / samples that actually worked and were worth looking at, would be front and center.  This taught me a lot about what happens to downstream code, generationally speaking.  Changes to an engine kill code.  I realize that Urho3D is under rather active development so some of this is unavoidable.  But I feel strongly that when it is possible, samples should be _easy_ for developers to write, and easy to migrate between versions.  Otherwise it all becomes a huge PITA and in the real world, people give up and move on with their lives.\n\nOh, and after doing that huge exercise which took me about a month, I concluded there wasn't enough \"worth it\" with Ogre3D to use it for anything.  One particular problem is it saw itself as only a 3D engine, not a game engine.  That made the ecology even harder to sustain.  For instance, it didn't bless any scripting languages.  Bindings to sane things like Lua were third party and bitrotted.  One reason I became interested in Urho3D is you _did_ bless a standard inventory of sane stuff.\n\nSomeone else did what needed to be done with Ogre3D, and that became the NeoAxis engine.  Which cost money.  Could easily have been an open source $0 project with a different developer attitude.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1059/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1058","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1058/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1058/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1058/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1058","id":118803495,"number":1058,"title":"Playback

Android Intel Atom CI build (both 32 and 64-bit) fail to create build artifact for STATIC lib type. Possible cause: Travis out of memory. [done]\n- Since upgrading the OSX build environment to Xcode7.1, the Urho3D_universal target exceeds the 50 minutes build time limit for iOS 64-bit CI build. Possible cause: slower VM where Xcode7.1 resides or the universal binary for Xcode7.1 has too many archs (yet to be verified). [done]\n- Fail to create mirror CI branches when commit message contains quotation mark. Cause: the string interpolation does not perform the necessary escape. [done]\n- Packaging for Emscripten does not include `Urho3D.js` and `Urho3D.js.data` (which are generated when EMSCRIPTEN_SHARE_DATA build option is being used). Cause: packaging bug. [done]\n- Build artifacts from CI build using Makefile have an incompatible CPU instruction with user's CPU. Cause: deployment target in the CI builds using Makefile is erroneously left to its default value 'native' where Travis CI VM image probably has a \"funky\" CPU type that is incompatible with common users have. [done]\n- Fail to run tests on AppVeyor. Cause: Although AppVeyor VM image has been setup with a \"display\" on session 1 but that display is not \"attached to desktop\", so SDL library terminates the app with this error log entry `No displays available`.\n- Build artifact (package) generation failure does not stop the build process at the moment. In the past the build artifacts are viewed only as a by-product. However, in doing so it is too late for us to realize we have problem in packaging when performing an actual release tag.

contains the convenience macro DEFINE_MAIN so that a cross-platform main function can be used by consumers of Urho3D.  It relies on the macro WIN32 for correct Windows behavior, but the correct macro for VS 2015 is _WIN32.  https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b0084kay.aspx  It seems WIN32 existed historically but has since been depreciated.  I haven't found a definitive reference for when that happened.  That MSDN page has a tab for looking at documentation for different compiler versions.  The earliest available is VS .NET 2003, which still shows _WIN32 as the correct macro.  So, we at least know the \"best practice\" has been the same for 12 years.\n\nThe consequence for a consuming application, such as Urho Sample Platformer, is DEFINE_MAIN doesn't work.
