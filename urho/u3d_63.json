multiple smaller-than-screen viewports are rendered, any intermediate textures used in the postprocessing, as well as the G-buffer in deferred rendering uses a texture that is as large as the screen or destination texture, in which the viewport is positioned. This has the following disadvantages:\n- Makes pingpong copies take more GPU bandwidth, as the whole screen is always copied\n- Makes the viewport texture sampling more complex (it needs to take viewport position into account)\n- Adjacent viewports \"bleed\" into each other in for example a bloom or blur shader\n\nThe reason this is done is to avoid allocation of several viewport-sized G-buffers in deferred rendering, but in this case the disadvantages outweigh that advantage and should be changed to use viewport sized textures instead.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/264","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/264/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/264/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/264/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/264","id":29627835,"number":264,"title":"Make
