The script files get correctly loaded and compiled. Right after loading them (in the same method) I can call methods on them just fine.\n\nThe issue comes when in another function (from another class) I retrieve the ScriptFile pointer and try to call some methods on it with Execute(). I get a segfault.\n\nAfter investigating a bit further I've found out that the internal ScriptModule pointer for the ScriptFile (retrieved with GetScriptModule() ). Points to a valid address before storing it to the hash table and points to null (memory address 0x0) after further retrieving it in another class. Note that the ScriptFile pointer itself still points to valid memory as I'm able to call the GetScriptModule() or Execute() methods.\n\nI've found a workaround by storing SharedPtr instead of raw pointers in the hash table, or simply storing a SharedPtr to it somewhere else for that matter. \n\nIf ResourceCache is returning a raw pointer I don't expect any SmartPointer magic happening on the background and I think this is a bug because of that. \n\nIf that's the intended behaviour, or need any additional feedback, I'd appreciate if you could answer me back.\n\nThank you!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/580/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/579","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/579/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/579/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/579/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/579","id":52952903,"number":579,"title":"\"No

code to reproduce the bug:\n\n``` c++\nVector<int> v;\nv.Push(1);\nv.Push(2);\nv.Push(3);\nforeach(int val, v)\n{\n    if (val == 2)\n        break;\n    printf(\"%i\\n\", val);\n}\n```\n\nInstead of expected\n\n```\n1\n```\n\nthe code outputs\n\n```\n1\n3\n```\n\nThe foreachv macro also suffers from the same bug.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/560","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/560/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/560/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/560/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/560","id":51527539,"number":560,"title":"[Editor]

Only items that made into the list below counts.\n# Succeeded\n- Shell scripts and batch jobs require external user input to determine the build tree location, similar to cmake-gui.\n- Collapse the project logical structure so that the repo root is the CMake's source tree. The build tree location is totally user defined and not being assumed. The project physical structure will be kept as it is.\n- Add another engine parameter to set the location of the asset directory (which contains the CoreData and Data subdirs).\n- Re-explore new approaches to configure native tool building while configuring for cross-compiling LuaJIT library build so that both native and cross-compiling targets can be built in one build process.\n- Creating an SDK-like include directory structure.\n- Remove the existing abstraction that makes headers appear to be flatten. The implementation file will now include the header file from its corresponding physical sub-directory where it belongs to. The header file will now use a relative pathspec to include other header files.\n# Failed\n\nnil\n#
