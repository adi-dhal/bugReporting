refactors the Graphics subdirectory headers to not use different versions based on the graphics API. This should make it possible to swap Urho3D library using whatever API in a client application, since the ABI should be the same in any case. Some API-specific functions are present in the headers, but these are explicitly marked, and should be a safe no-op when called on the \"wrong\" API.\n\nIn addition code duplication was reduced by moving common functionality into a separate .cpp file in Graphics directory, away from the API-specific .cpp files.\n\nTesting is welcome, since this is quite a large change.\n\nNote that three explicitly API-specific classes remain, but these are for internal use only and not needed in applications: GraphicsImpl, ShaderProgram, and VertexDeclaration.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1447/reactions","total_count":11,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":5}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1446","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1446/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1446/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1446/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1446","id":163283042,"number":1446,"title":"KEY_ESC

done] This is a question and not necessarily becomes an issue that we need to solve (depends on the feedback). On one hand the development of this toolchain file seems to stale at the upstream. On the other hand, we have deviated more and more from the original version. Personally, I hate to add the \"Urho3D\" modification tags every time I need to change things, and I also found a few weirdness in that toolchain file that I am not able to fully explain. It is the most complicated toolchain file that we currently have. Our custom toolchain files are much straightforward in comparison. i.e. We may be paying the price of things that we don't actually need.\n\nIt is not a CMake standard module at any rate, so I don't think it is terribly wrong if we have our own custom Android toolchain file. We could still track the upstream changes, if any, even after we have developed our custom version, of course.\n\nWhat say

Now it is 4. I suppose it is enough for most cases. Is it enough? Is it okay to add extra 64 bytes for each drawable?\nWhere can I place this constant? Is `GraphicDefs.h` good place?\n\nCustom per-instance data also does not work without instancing. I tried to implement it, but it requires extra uniform in all shaders and related changes, so I decided to do nothing.\nI just added possibility to force instancing on for all render-ops. Could it break something?\n\nLet's discuss..\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1423/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1422","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1422/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1422/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1422/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1422","id":159900101,"number":1422,"title":"API-agnostic graphics class headers","user":{"login":"cadaver","id":51361,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/51361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver","html_url":"https://github.com/cadaver","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadaver/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038070,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/6","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/6/labels","id":1933969,"number":6,"title":"1.6","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":444,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-08-10T03:15:59Z","updated_at":"2017-07-23T10:49:18Z","due_on":"2016-08-08T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-08-10T03:29:24Z"},"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-06-13T08:46:16Z","updated_at":"2017-02-21T11:58:19Z","closed_at":"2016-07-06T12:48:00Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Related to the discussion in https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1397, this proposes a change that just a one graphics API agnostic copy of public Graphics subdirectory header files (ie.
