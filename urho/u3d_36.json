Both of these libs build for mobile so cross platform should be ok.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1067/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1066","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1066/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1066/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1066/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1066","id":119392453,"number":1066,"title":"provide simple MIT licensed way to detect compiled 3D API","user":{"login":"bvanevery","id":734930,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/734930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery","html_url":"https://github.com/bvanevery","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvanevery/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":301786971,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/build%20system","name":"build system","color":"5319e7","default":false},{"id":59038070,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/6","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/6/labels","id":1933969,"number":6,"title":"1.6","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":444,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-08-10T03:15:59Z","updated_at":"2017-07-23T10:49:18Z","due_on":"2016-08-08T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-08-10T03:29:24Z"},"comments":21,"created_at":"2015-11-29T22:28:33Z","updated_at":"2016-08-10T03:25:22Z","closed_at":"2015-12-25T02:49:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Urho3D only supports one 3D API at a time.  That decision is made at compile time.  The documentation section \"Shaders... API Differences\" talks about the \"D3D11\" and \"GL3\" macros being defined according to the 3D API in use, but this is not actually true for consumers of Urho3D as a library.  Rather, URHO3D_D3D11 or URHO3D_OPENGL are passed as command line /D options to Urho3D's build.  They are not made readily available to any third party code.  One could incorporate pkg-config into one's project, but this is GPL V2 code and also a rather heavyweight requirement for someone just trying to get some Urho3D sample code going.  Culturally it may seem common on Linux to assume pkg-config is available and people know how to use it, but that isn't true on Windows and I have no idea on OSX.\n\nIt would be quite acceptable to have macros such as URHO3D_D3D11 or URHO3D_OPENGL actually defined in an Urho3D header file somewhere, and therefore available to consumers like the documentation actually says.  The advisability of this method, is related to the request for a general \"configuration header\" in #991.  Having only a single header for every macro, does tend to trigger massive rebuilds in real world projects when any option is changed.  It may be better to distribute such macros across the Urho3D header files that are actually relevant to them.\n\nAn example of real world need for this mechanism came up in https://github.com/gawag/Urho-Sample-Platformer/issues/14 .  I spent a few solid days tearing my hair out trying to figure out why the USP code didn't work on my system but did work on the developer's.  Lots and lots of debug tracing, looking at lots of resource paths that seemed to be loading ok, but were difficult to cover in their entireity.  Finally we learned about the debug log file and I noticed that lots of shaders had failed to load.  The dev was only providing GLSL shaders, and I had built my Urho3D for DX11.  Nothing in the build had warned me that this wouldn't work, and upon investigation, I see pkg-config is the only method by which such things would be known.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1066/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1065","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1065/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1065/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1065/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1065","id":119388355,"number":1065,"title":"(FEATURE REQUEST) Writing all config definitions to Urho3D.h","user":{"login":"1vanK","id":13021826,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13021826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK","html_url":"https://github.com/1vanK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1vanK/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":301786971,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/build%20system","name":"build system","color":"5319e7","default":false},{"id":59038069,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true},{"id":59038073,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/wontfix","name":"wontfix","color":"ffffff","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/6","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/6/labels","id":1933969,"number":6,"title":"1.6","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":444,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-08-10T03:15:59Z","updated_at":"2017-07-23T10:49:18Z","due_on":"2016-08-08T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-08-10T03:29:24Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-11-29T21:06:17Z","updated_at":"2016-08-10T03:25:22Z","closed_at":"2015-12-25T15:41:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We can use COMPILE_DEFINITIONS for it: string (REPLACE \";\"...\nIt allows users to manually create new projects without using CMake.\n\nAlso we can add libs to header file like\n\n```\n#if define(_MSC_VER)\n#    if defined(_DEBUG)\n#        pragma comment(lib, \"Urho3D_d.lib\")\n#    else\n#        pragma comment(lib, \"Urho3D.lib\")\n#    endif\n#endif\n```\n\nI think it's much easier to create new projects.
