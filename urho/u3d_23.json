modules\n\n```\n#include <Urho3D/Module.h>\n```\n\nThis is a balance between 1 umbrella header for everything and the what is now. I see there is an umbrella header for each module but it is not clear if it's an umbrella header as it only includes a few items from that module. Judging on the samples source code it's not a proper umbrella header.\n# Solution 3: Class Level\n\nThis is Similar to what c++ standard library does\n\n```\n#include <Urho3D/ClassName.h>\n```\n\nThe complete opposite of umbrella header.\n\nI like Solution 1 & 2 as they can be done together. Solution 3 is much too granular.\n\nThank you.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1472/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1471","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1471/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1471/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1471/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1471","id":165796952,"number":1471,"title":"issues

shadow maps rendering consume a lot of performances. For games that need a \"lot\" of light sources this is very problematic as the shadow maps are rendered every frames. With just 3 point light the frame rate is dropping quite a bit and this is sad because the rest of the engine is quite well optimized :)\n\nA basic idea would be to have flags on each drawables, those flags would be for example: \n\nLIGHT_DYNAMIC\nLIGHT_STATIC\n\nTwo shadow maps would be generated for each spot and point lights source. and the idea is to only draw the shadow map when needed based on those flags and when the drawables are moving. So the shadows are not drawn every frames like it is now.\n\nThis optimization is explained here: http://www.leadwerks.com/werkspace/blog/1/entry-114-double-buffered-shadow-maps/\n\nI have tested this optimization in leadwerks engine in the past, before and after and the performance gain was very noticeable.\n\nI can't handle this work myself as i miss some knowledge on the subject but i would be very happy if Cadaver could try it. I think it's very important to optimize shadow rendering as it have a too big impact on performances for now :) \n\nWhat is your opinion about it @cadaver ? \n\nThank you\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1465/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1464","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1464/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1464/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1464/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1464","id":164631479,"number":1464,"title":"Build

suggest some changes in Urho3D.Container that I found useful during writing some code that uses Urho3D as C++ library.\n1. Add nullptr_t ctors to SharedPtr and WeakPtr (guarded by URHO3D_CXX11). This allows to write `foo(nullptr)` or `return nullptr` instead of `return SharedPtr<SomeClass>()`\n2. Add aggregate ctor to PODVector (guarded by URHO3D_CXX11). It looks strange that Vector has aggregate ctor but PODVector doesn't.\n3. Make [POD]Vector::Buffer() public. It allows to get rid of ugly `foo(&vec[0], vec.Size())` and _it prevents asserts if vector is empty_.\n\nIf you accept [some of] these changes I'll make PR.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1456","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1456/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1456/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1456/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1456","id":163779551,"number":1456,"title":"RigidBody2D

So we have to check for ASCII-characters.\n        if( fileSize >= 500 ) {\n            isASCII = true;\n            for( unsigned int i = 0; i < 500; i++ ) {\n                if( buffer[ i ] > 127 ) { // warning: comparison is always false due to limited range of data type [-Wtype-limits]\n                    isASCII = false;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n### Strangeness 2\n\nThis was an interesting warning, which I believe is actually an error.\nSource/Tools/AssetImporter/AssetImporter.cpp:1191\n\n``` cpp\n        // Find out the start time of animation from each channel's first keyframe for adjusting the keyframe times\n        // to start from zero\n        float startTime = duration;\n        for (unsigned j = 0; j < anim->mNumChannels; ++j)\n        {\n            aiNodeAnim* channel = anim->mChannels[j];\n            if (channel->mNumPositionKeys > 0)\n                startTime = Min(startTime, (float)channel->mPositionKeys[0].mTime);\n            if (channel->mNumRotationKeys > 0)\n                startTime = Min(startTime, (float)channel->mRotationKeys[0].mTime);\n            if (channel->mScalingKeys > 0) // warning: ordered comparison of pointer with integer zero [-Wextra]\n\n                startTime = Min(startTime, (float)channel->mScalingKeys[0].mTime);\n        }\n```\n\nI believe this should be this?
