Consider the following lua snippet in a ScriptObject that's attached to a scene node. \n\nfunction MyScript:ApplyAttributes() \n    --point_A_noideid is the node id for a node in the scene\n    point_A = self.node:GetScene():GetNode(self.point_A_nodeid)\n    print(self.point_A_nodeid)\n    print(point_A)\nend\n\nWhen assigning the node id to 16777226, saving the scene and restaring, the printed value for self.point_A_nodeid is 16777200 instead (those numbers are just an example, the ones just giving me trouble actually).\n\nEven though lua uses doubles for its internal representation to numbers, that's only half the problem. The real issue seems to be with how the editor is storing those values (which I'm guessing could be a 32 bit float?). Let me explain a bit further:\n\nWhen loading the scene the following output appears in the console:\n\n```\n16777200 \nnil\n```\n\nAlso, the value displayed in the input field for the node id is 1.67772e+07.\n\nBut now comes the interesting part. If I manually drag and drop a node to the input field, the value 16777226 (the intended one) appears in the field, and the console shows:\n\n```\n16777226\nuserdata: 0x4011cbe0\n```\n\nIf after that I close the scene, or just select another node in the hierarchy, the value is changed and the last two digits are lost, making the value nil in the process.\n\nI think this is an editor bug, because information is lost somehow when de-selecting a scene node.

As an example, my engine library indirectly includes inputevents.h, which has:\n\n```\n#include <SDL/SDL_joystick.h>\n#include <SDL/SDL_gamecontroller.h>\n// ... etc.\n```\n\nThe trouble is, the folder layout is as such:\n\n```\nThirdParty\\SDL\\include\\xxx.h\n```\n\nThere's also Connection.h, which has `<kNet/kNetFwd.h>` : `kNet/include/kNetFwd.h` - and `<kNet/SharedPtr.h>` : `kNet/include/kNet/SharedPtr.h` as an additional example. No doubt there's many others.\nBecause I'm using Visual Studio (linux ports kept in consideration), I'm unable to specify an 'additional include directory' because the folder path doesn't match a possible inclusion format. I see a couple of options, both with obvious drawbacks:\n- Adjust all the source includes to specify `<SDL_xxx.h>`\n- symlink the headers inside the parent folder, so `<SDL/xxx.h>` resolves properly\n\nAre there any plans to change the third-party inclusion names? I don't recall having this problem with 1.32, but have been away from it for a few months! I don't use CMake (I prefer to design the project files for Windows + Linux by hand, so I can learn the systems, and have non-hardcoded design), so for Visual Studio I specify my project paths inside property sheets like the below image, which enables me to switch/upgrade versions with one simple change:\n\n![propsheet](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7099124/8361094/ee322f60-1b25-11e5-9bd5-8b5bed0c20e0.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/750/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/749","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/749/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/749/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/749/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/749","id":90761556,"number":749,"title":"(feature request) Pls add new Event","user":{"login":"v0van1981","id":9742588,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/9742588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/v0van1981","html_url":"https://github.com/v0van1981","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v0van1981/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v0van1981/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v0van1981/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v0van1981/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v0van1981/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v0van1981/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v0van1981/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v0van1981/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v0van1981/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038073,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/wontfix","name":"wontfix","color":"ffffff","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/5/labels","id":1408188,"number":5,"title":"1.5","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":289,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-11-12T10:20:35Z","updated_at":"2015-11-18T08:30:55Z","due_on":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2015-11-12T10:47:52Z"},"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-06-24T19:13:09Z","updated_at":"2015-11-12T10:38:29Z","closed_at":"2015-06-24T19:52:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Please add new event between scene rendering and UI rendering.
