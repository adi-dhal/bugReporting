I didn't attempt to bring this back in.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/897/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/896","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/896/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/896/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/896/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/896","id":106686613,"number":896,"title":"Export OBJ files from the Urho3D Editor","user":{"login":"JSandusky","id":5519639,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5519639?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JSandusky","html_url":"https://github.com/JSandusky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JSandusky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JSandusky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JSandusky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JSandusky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JSandusky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JSandusky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JSandusky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JSandusky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JSandusky/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038070,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/5/labels","id":1408188,"number":5,"title":"1.5","description":"","creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":289,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-11-12T10:20:35Z","updated_at":"2015-11-18T08:30:55Z","due_on":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2015-11-12T10:47:52Z"},"comments":10,"created_at":"2015-09-16T02:41:22Z","updated_at":"2015-11-12T10:30:45Z","closed_at":"2015-09-29T18:13:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/pulls/896","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/896","diff_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/896.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/896.patch"},"body":"This pull request adds OBJ export of either the entire scene or just the selected drawables to the editor. Includes normals and texture coordinates (TEXCOORD1) if present in the drawable's geometry. Doesn't write a material file yet (having trouble grokking that format) and all drawable's are written using their highest LOD. Special reminder: Blender ignores OBJ vertex normals.\n\nExample uses:\n- Send scene geometry to Houdini to do voodoo like flowmaps and such\n- Use to aid in modeling a \"fitted\" model \n- Author animation for the actual space (ie. dreaded ladder rungs)\n- Run analysis tools on it (vertex density \"hotness,\" etc)\n- Use for offline rendering\n- Not great for combining geometry into a single static geometry (bad workflow for that), but can be used for it\n- etc\n\nI haven't been able to come up with a reason for this to be used outside of the Editor scenario, so there's no bindings for Lua. That would require refactoring the functions out to someplace else. I don't have a problem with making those changes though, just don't see a reason.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/896/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/895","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/895/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/895/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/895/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/895","id":106552930,"number":895,"title":"Navigation

\"04_StaticScene.as\".\nMost of the bug code is in lines 69-89.\n\n**How to replicate:**\nUse the debug version \"start_d.bat\"\nAfter the first animation ends and the second animation starts, exit the program by pressing ESC, and you should get asserts.\n\nWhen playing the second animation, if it's the same as the first one it won't assert.\nMaybe it has something to do with AnimationController's AnimationStates?\n\nIn my game it happens when I restart the level, which includes removing the scene's script instance.\nIn Urho3DPlayer it happens when you exit the

of a command and associated settings for generating cubemaps in the Urho3D editor.\n\nCubemap sampling is performed at the position of the node containing a selected zone. This is deliberate as node position is considered to be the \"true\" position of the zone for sampling purposes. For other reasons a zone may need to reach substantially outside of this range (ie. into the sky), even though only a limited area is really relevant for cubemap generation.\n\nDuring this process existing zones are disabled and duplicates are made matching their traits, this is deliberate to prevent doubling of anything that may depend on the Zone texture.\n\nThe added \"GetImage\" method to Texture2D in script is intended solely for editor usage. It is likely not sufficiently robust for general purpose usage.\n\nCubemaps are by default written to Data/Textures/Cubemaps/{SceneName}, and are named by the component ID of the zone.
