it seem that decals set have some memory problems.\n\nI have made a terrain decal system so i am creating one decalset per terrain patch (to handle decals at patch border correctly) the system is working fine and the decals are correctly positioned and rendered. \n\nWhen i am traveling over the terrain with my free camera i can see the decals and everything is fine but after a few seconds (there is no exact time) the memory start to grow up more and more quite fast. Here is my observations: \n- When the camera do not move the memory consumption is **not** growing up \n- When the camera distance to decalset is above the decalset draw distance and if the camera is moving  the memory consumption is **not** growing up \n- The memory is only growing up when the camera is moving and when the decals are rendered\n- It seem that DecalSet::UpdateBuffers() is called regularly, don't know if it is a normal behaviour or not.\n- I have tried to set a null drawrange, of course i have 3 frames per seconds but the memory consumption is crazy (like 6Gb instead of 800mb when i use a drawrange of 256.0 on decals sets)\n- I have tested to fly with the camera over some StaticModelGroups (my vegetation system) and there no such memory consumption problem. Memory consumption is very stable.\n\nTested under Windows / DX11. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1626/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1625","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1625/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1625/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1625/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1625","id":180275984,"number":1625,"title":"Multisample textures with DX11","user":{"login":"t-artikov","id":1927992,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1927992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-artikov","html_url":"https://github.com/t-artikov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-artikov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-artikov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-artikov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-artikov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-artikov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-artikov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-artikov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-artikov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-artikov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-09-30T10:54:21Z","updated_at":"2016-09-30T11:48:59Z","closed_at":"2016-09-30T11:48:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"New multisample textures feature seems not working with DX11.\nI change the RenderToTexture example\n- renderTexture->SetSize(1024, 768, Graphics::GetRGBFormat(), TEXTURE_RENDERTARGET);\n+ renderTexture->SetSize(1024, 768, Graphics::GetRGBFormat(), TEXTURE_RENDERTARGET, 8);\nAs result the renderTexture becomes one-colored.\n\nThe same changes work fine with DX9.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1625/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1624","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1624/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1624/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1624/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1624","id":180246574,"number":1624,"title":"Troubles to reconstruct world position from depth","user":{"login":"OldSnake22","id":8931643,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/8931643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OldSnake22","html_url":"https://github.com/OldSnake22","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OldSnake22/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OldSnake22/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OldSnake22/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OldSnake22/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OldSnake22/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OldSnake22/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OldSnake22/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OldSnake22/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OldSnake22/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038072,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/question","name":"question","color":"cc317c","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2016-09-30T08:18:50Z","updated_at":"2016-09-30T11:17:02Z","closed_at":"2016-09-30T10:36:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hello, i have switched from PBRDeferred to PBRDeferredHWDepth (can you confirm me that this is better in terms of performances ?)\n\nI have made a custom height fog shader that was working well with linear depth but since i have switched to hardware depth i have some troubles and the height fog is **working only under certain camera angles**.\nI have already adapted the shader to use the \"ReconstructDepth\" function.\n\nThis method for reconstructing the world pos was working well with linear depth: const float3 worldPos = iFarRay \\* depth; \n\nOr maybe it is a problem with screenpos ? \n\nHere is the VS and PS shader. \n\nCan you help me there ?
