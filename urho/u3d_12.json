When you stop, those that are in front of you look good, but when you start looking around, you find that some of the other billboards have strange small size. When you move even a little, their size gets fixed. I modified the Billboards example to show how this happens.\r\n\r\nFirst I turned off animation:\r\n\r\n```Diff\r\n@@ -325,7 +326,7 @@ void Billboards::HandleUpdate(StringHash eventType, VariantMap& eventData)\r\n \r\n     // Move the camera and animate the scene, scale movement with time step\r\n     MoveCamera(timeStep);\r\n-    AnimateScene(timeStep);\r\n+//    AnimateScene(timeStep);\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I turned BillBoards to fixed size:\r\n\r\n```Diff\r\n@@ -150,12 +150,13 @@ void Billboards::CreateScene()\r\n         billboardObject->SetNumBillboards(NUM_BILLBOARDS);\r\n         billboardObject->SetMaterial(cache->GetResource<Material>(\"Materials/LitSmoke.xml\"));\r\n         billboardObject->SetSorted(true);\r\n+        billboardObject->SetFixedScreenSize(true);\r\n \r\n         for (unsigned j = 0; j < NUM_BILLBOARDS; ++j)\r\n         {\r\n             Billboard* bb = billboardObject->GetBillboard(j);\r\n             bb->position_ = Vector3(Random(12.0f) - 6.0f, Random(8.0f) - 4.0f, Random(12.0f) - 6.0f);\r\n-            bb->size_ = Vector2(Random(2.0f) + 3.0f, Random(2.0f) + 3.0f);\r\n+            bb->size_ = Vector2::ONE * 100;\r\n             bb->rotation_ = Random() * 360.0f;\r\n             bb->enabled_ = true;\r\n         }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is how you can see the bug:\r\n\r\n1. Stop moving. Billboards in front of you look good.\r\n\r\n![1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3167494/22523543/6f1a91aa-e8c8-11e6-8790-92bbe32a7836.jpg)\r\n\r\n2. Look to your side. Some of the billboards are smaller than others, although they should have same size.\r\n\r\n![2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3167494/22523564/81aadbb8-e8c8-11e6-8ee7-ef9bfa90d308.jpg)\r\n\r\n3.

For now every time some joint parameter is changed, the joint gets recreated. It involves destruction of an old object, change of joint definition and then creation of a new joint with altered parameters. For most cases it might be a good way to handle this, despite the fact this is not so performant.\r\n\r\nBut some joints have internal state which gets lost during the process. For example the prismatic joint with its lower and upper translation. Limits are computed for rigid bodies during the creation of a prismatic joint. If bodies move away during the simulation (due to gravity or a motor) and then joint gets recreated, the limits are computed again but for bodies in other positions, which stretches (or narrows) the limits creating strange behaviors.\r\n\r\nI tried to change the joint parameter directly (for example a motor speed) without joint recreation and then it worked correctly.
