The following line:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/blob/master/CMake/Modules/FindDirectX.cmake#L78\r\n\r\nResults in an error, since the file doesn't seems to exists in the expected directory.\r\nI've solved it by simply editing the output_file path to an absolute one, using same variable.\r\n\r\n```\r\nexecute_process (COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo \"#include <_mingw.h>\" COMMAND ${CMAKE_C_COMPILER} -E -M - OUTPUT_FILE ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/find_mingw_sysroot_output)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the original cmake code at line 77 doesn't contains ```${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}```, and from some reason it causes issues. I also see no reason to use absolute paths either, specially since it's being used a second later to read from that file anyway.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1674/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1673","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1673/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1673/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1673/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1673","id":187479337,"number":1673,"title":"Area

noticed that adding new nodes in Editor costs much more than I expected.\nE.g. when I have several thousands of nodes, adding new node takes about 15ms and this time grows with scene complexity. This is quite important for procedurally spawned nodes (even temporary), because spawning several hundreds of nodes take more than second.\nThe biggest part of time is spent inside _nodeadded_ event.\nI suppose it is caused by rebuilding and reallocating of items list even if hierarchy is hidden or collapsed.\nI am trying to somehow optimise it... E.g. create tree data structure instead of plain vector inside HierarchyContainer. Or maybe just disable all these updates if hierarchy is hidden.\nDoes anybody have good ideas?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1664/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1663","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1663/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1663/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/1663/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/1663","id":184586617,"number":1663,"title":"Don't
