mentioned in the previous discussion (See https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/511), i have forked again and focused on a cleaner way to get a proper pull request. This time, close to no code in libraries has been changed, except for kNet as it has been said that it was already heavily tweaked for Urho3D.\n\nThis is the first step of future work on the project, to allow clean SDK for any platform the \"standard\" way. Eg for OSX, generation of a .framework with self-contained libs, headers, etc, with an unique INCLUDE_PATH as it's usually the case.\n\nI have done the misstake of rebasing and squashing all my commits before pushing... Everything is in one single commit again. I have could re-do it using incremental commits as suggested by @weitjong if you prefer, now that i exactly have in mind what needs to be changed and in what order.\n\nSee commit message on commit 7797150 for infos:\nAdd TmpBuilds to SCM ignore list.\n- Move AngelScript/include to AngelScript/include/AngelScript, and change CMake / Urho3D includes accordingly. In AngelScript source code, only as_config.h was changed.\n- Move Bullet/include to Bullet/include/Bullet, and change CMake / Urho3D includes accordingly. No source file in Bullet was changed.\n- Move kNet/include to kNet/include/kNet, and change CMake / Urho3D includes accordingly. Change most of the kNet source code include directives.\n- Move SDL/include to SDL/include/SDL, and change CMake / Urho3D includes accordingly. A few auto-generated files (By original SDL configure script) were changed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/513","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/513/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/513/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/513/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/513","id":47821263,"number":513,"title":"ColorCorrection post process returns black","user":{"login":"ucupumar","id":5253453,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5253453?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ucupumar","html_url":"https://github.com/ucupumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ucupumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ucupumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ucupumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ucupumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ucupumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ucupumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ucupumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ucupumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ucupumar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59038068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/milestones/2/labels","id":593503,"number":2,"title":"1.32","description":null,"creator":{"login":"weitjong","id":5548048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5548048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong","html_url":"https://github.com/weitjong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weitjong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":278,"state":"closed","created_at":"2014-03-11T04:43:07Z","updated_at":"2015-07-16T05:18:08Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2014-11-28T04:55:53Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-11-05T10:32:32Z","updated_at":"2014-11-28T04:54:44Z","closed_at":"2014-11-05T14:39:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"ColorCorrection post process returns black on both OpenGL and DirectX.

Where to find them?\n\nCMake files changed accordingly:\n1) AngelScript:\n- In AngelScript/CMakeLists.txt, the install directive copies things from AngelScript/include/AngelScript since it moved.\n- From the Urho3D source files, replaced any \"#include <angelscript.h>\" with it's new counterpart (<AngelScript/angelscript.h>).\n- Other various files changed:\n  - \"AngelScript/source/as_config.h\": Inclusion fix (From \"../include/angelscript.h\" to \"AngelScript/angelscript.h\").\n    FINAL NOTES: Zero changes done in the library code itself.\n\n2) Box2D:\nFINAL NOTES: Clean and SDK-compliant, nothing to be done here.\n\n3) Bullet:\n- In Bullet/CMakeLists.txt, replaced any occurence to \"src\" to match the new \"src/Bullet\".\n- From the Urho3D source files, changed any bullet include reference to it's proper new counterpart (With the leading \"Bullet/\" prefix).\n  FINAL NOTES: Many of the includes in Bullet were wrong relative to the file they were called.\n\n4) kNet:\n- In kNet/CMakeLists.txt, replaced any occurence to \"include\" to match the new \"include/kNet\", and added an include directive for it to build properly.\n- From the Urho3D source files, changed any kNet include reference to it's proper counterpart. Especially, replaced all individual kNet/\\* include by the global kNet.h or kNetFwd.h when required.\n  FINAL NOTES: Most of the kNet includes were wrong... Very bad consistency from it's maintainer regarding relative paths. Most of them were re-written in the refactoring process, and since i've been told it was already a changed library, i hope it doesn't matters too much.\n\n5) SDL:\n- In SDL/CMakeLists.txt, changed the install directive to match the new SDL headers path.\n- Added an include directive for SDL itself to be able to compile.\n- Also changed to match the new scheme:\n  - \"SDL/src/events/SDL_touch_c.h\": Inclusion fix.\n- From the Urho3D source files, changed any reference to include SDL to match the new correct compatible scheme.\n  FINAL NOTES: Just one file from the SDL itself was corrected. Easy to maintain.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/510","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/510/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/510/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/510/events","html_url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/510","id":47552092,"number":510,"title":"ScrollView::

everyone,\n\nWe are working on a project that will be using Urho3D mostly in windowed mode (https://github.com/realXtend/tundra-urho3d). There will be options to go fullscreen etc. later. In any case, I was implementing storing window position and size to config file so that we can open the window with same pos/size when you reopen the application.\n\n**Problems I encountered**\n- `E_SCREENMODE` does not provide window position.\n- Querying `Graphics::GetWindowPosition()` returns a `IntVector2::ZERO` if the SDL window has been destroyed.\n  - This is the case when I query the position on application exit if the user has closed the window from the `[x]` button in the window frame.\n- Related to above, there is no event to listen \"window about to be destroyed\" so that users app could query the pos/size prior to the window being destroyed.\n- `SDL_WINDOWEVENT_MOVED` was not handled by the `Input` system to notify `Graphics` of pos changes.\n\n**Proposed solution**\n\nI have implemented all the missing parts. `GetWindowPosition()` will still return `ZERO` vec if windows has been destroyed. But the new event params in `E_SCREENMODE` and new event `E_WINDOWABOUTTOCLOSE` are there to get info about changes and let you query before window destruction.\n\nI am new to Urho3D and don't know your coding convention and naming schema that well. I did my best to respect the existing code style. Here are parts that you might have input on, please give it and I'll fix issues. Or say this kind of feature is not needed, thats fine too :)\n- Are the new `WindowPositionX/Y` Engine init param names ok?\n- Are the new `P_POSITION_X/Y` param names in `E_SCREENMODE` ok (could also be `P_X/Y`)? Is `E_SCREENMODE` even the right message for this data?\n- I changed `int width_/height_` to `IntVector2 size_` and added new `IntVector2 position_`, Saw no meaningful reason for not to be a vector, except readability?\n- Is the new event `E_WINDOWABOUTTOCLOSE` name ok? Is it a problem in terms of the `Context*` etc. that this event is sent in dtor? Both GL and D3D9 Graphics do this if window is not closed from the `[x]` button in the window frame.\n  - Futhermore this might lead into dangerouns calls into the `Graphics` subsystem while it is in its dtor. I could not think of a more elegant solution. One option is to remove this event all together, but would sure be nice to know when the windows is being destroyed.\n  - This could also be a non issue as I dont know the codebase. If `Graphics::Close` is always called prior to its destruction the current code should be ok (never sent from dtor).\n\nWould appreciate comments feedback if you need changes. Cheers...\n\n**Edit:** Tested the code on both Windows and Ubuntu. Ubuntu will reposition the window inside desktop if any parts of it goes out of bounds (at least from the bottom). Windows does not seem to reposition it automatically.\n\nThere might be a need for a utility for checking that initial create position is inside the desktop.
