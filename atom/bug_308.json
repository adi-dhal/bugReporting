errors and spawn errors can be handled consistently.\n\nWithout this you would need to wrap `new BufferedProcess` calls in a `try`/`catch` block which isn't very intuitive given that `error` events are emitted in most cases.\n\nFixes #5560\nFixes #6556\n\n/cc @benogle

`editor.useHardwareAcceleration` is deprecated, here's an issue._\n\nI'm in a nVidia driver hell since upgrading to Ubuntu 15.04, and though Chrome's `--disable-gpu` does prevent it from crashing my whole system, Atom's (0.196) `editor.useHardwareAcceleration` doesn't, ending in a rather painful way: cursor jitter, screen flickering, regular keyboard/mouse input loss, impossible to switch to a non-X tty → restart with [REISUB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key).\n\nIs there a workaround or a way to be more drastic about disabling gpu acceleration like the Chrome flag does? Or is it too antagonistic to improving performance?\n\n~~I'll be glad to provide debug info.~~ EDIT I no longer have access to the nVidia machine and can no longer help, unsubscribing from this issue I created.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6556","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6556/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6556/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6556/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6556","id":71654349,"number":6556,"title":"Uncaught

Sure, it'll be wiped on upgrades (I would think), but it does seem a little strange that Atom makes it so easy to edit the contents of all of its licenses. Not sure about the best way to handle this - maybe just opening the Markdown Preview version (assuming it's not disabled), and falling back to a buffer if it is disabled?

While it requires obviously some technical precisions (no command line option must be used), the exemple is given of a shortcut in a OSX Dock, but I'm on windows... So I tried to delete anything unnecessary in the windows atom short cut (there were like ../update.exe -open atom.exe) so I just let ../atom.exe\n\nIt doesn't seem to work.... at all.\n\nI don't have many pluggins only essentials (I guess), here is the list : atom-alignment, atom-color-highlight, autocomplete-plus, emmet, file-icons, linter, minimap, Sublime-style-columns-selection.\n\nShould I disable any pluggin to test ? And reactivate one by one. Or is this a common known problem ?\nI've seen the update is fairly recent, so I may be the first to get the problem.\n\nI hope this'll help you, I'm open to any question if you need anything

changes `workspace::resetFontSize`'s behavior from restoring Atom's default font size to restoring the window's starting font size. \n\nThis is, I think, far more useful behavior than restoring Atom's default font size, which you can do by just emptying the Font Size input in Settings View. If you've ever had to change the font size to make code more readable to others temporarily (ie. a presentation or a talk), having a command to return to what you had configured originally is a godsend. (I've found myself in that situation quite often.)\n\nPlease try this branch out and let me know what you think! :wink:\n\n/cc @atom/feedback \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6538","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6538/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6538/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6538/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6538","id":71394876,"number":6538,"title":"Confusing behavior of Cursor.getCurrentWordBufferRange()","user":{"login":"DanEEStar","id":1432939,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1432939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanEEStar","html_url":"https://github.com/DanEEStar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanEEStar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanEEStar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanEEStar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanEEStar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanEEStar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanEEStar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanEEStar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanEEStar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanEEStar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2015-04-27T20:35:30Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T20:10:30Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T20:10:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have a very simple file containing nothing but the text `-12`.\nWhen I execute the `getCurrentWordBufferRange()`-method on this text with the cursor on different positions of the text I get 3 different results:\n- \"-\" cursor position [0,0]\n- \"-12\" cursor position [0,1]\n- \"12\" cursor position [0, 2]\n\nIs this really the expected behaviour of `getCurrenWordBufferRange()`?
