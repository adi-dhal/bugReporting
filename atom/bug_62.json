Click the squirrel icon for more information.\"*  \r\n\r\nBut when I click the icon, the About page has no indication about a new version being installed on update.  Instead, this page should include the same message as shown in the squirrel icon hover.  As is, I did not notice the hover at first, clicked the icon, and just saw \"Atom is up to date!\", which is the opposite of what the squirrel icon is trying to convey.\r\n\r\nAnother related annoyance in this situation is that clicking the \"Check now\" for updates button reports that my outdated version is the latest version (e.g., \"Version 1.14.4 is the latest version.\")\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nI'm not sure on how to reproduce consistently. At what point does Atom download the new version? Was that automatic?\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** When Atom is pending a restart to install an update, indicate on the About page that this is the case, and provide a \"Restart\" button for easy restarting/installing.  Also, clicking the \"Check now\" for updates button should not say my outdated version is up to date.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Atom's About page simply says, \"Atom is up to date!\" Clicking the \"Check now\" button says an outdated version is up to date.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Not sure\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ atom --version\r\nAtom    : 1.14.4\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\n$ apm --version\r\napm  1.15.3\r\nnpm  3.10.5\r\nnode 4.4.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.11\r\ngit 2.10.1\r\n\r\nMacOS version 10.12.3\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\nn/a","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13996/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13995","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13995/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13995/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13995/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13995","id":213803000,"number":13995,"title":"File save issues in 1.15","user":{"login":"umpirsky","id":208957,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/208957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umpirsky","html_url":"https://github.com/umpirsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umpirsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umpirsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umpirsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umpirsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umpirsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umpirsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umpirsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umpirsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umpirsky/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-03-13T15:28:04Z","updated_at":"2017-03-13T16:58:00Z","closed_at":"2017-03-13T16:56:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\r\n\r\nThis started to happen after upgrade  from `1.14.0` to `1.15.0`.\r\n\r\nAfter file save file chooser is not focused and current folder is not selected.\r\n\r\n![screencast from 13-03-17 16_21_47](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/208957/23861282/db353588-0809-11e7-9799-7779276a0565.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

If it does succeed, touchpad input is killed for some reason.\r\n\r\n```\r\nbash: cannot set terminal process group (-1): Inappropriate ioctl for device\r\nbash: no job control in this shell\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. With Lubuntu, start Atom through panel.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Client to start and function normally.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Unusual behavior and manipulation of other windows.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.15.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nLubuntu 16.10\r\nTo fix, just edit /usr/share/applications/Atom.desktop and set it to exec

However, the version number next to the update button lists the currently installed version, and the link to the release notes also points to the old release notes. This does not make sense.  \r\nWhen clicking the update button, I actually don't even know whether I'm about to install a minor or major update.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Wait for a new Atom release\r\n2. Go to \"About\"\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nThe current version is shown at the top, the latest available version is shown in the \"New update\" box. The \"Restart and install\" button will actually install the version that is about to be installed.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n![atomupdate](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6407709/23831990/68ddf0e8-072c-11e7-91ff-6966c82f922b.png)\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:**\r\n100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nAt least 1.14.x and previous ones. Possibly also master, can't check when on the latest version.\r\nUsing Windows 7 and macOS Sierra.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13988/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13987","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13987/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13987/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13987/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13987","id":213597769,"number":13987,"title":"src/config.coffee should use _.deepClone from underscore-plus","user":{"login":"adityaYashwanth","id":8922417,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8922417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityaYashwanth","html_url":"https://github.com/adityaYashwanth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityaYashwanth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityaYashwanth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityaYashwanth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityaYashwanth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityaYashwanth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityaYashwanth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityaYashwanth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityaYashwanth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityaYashwanth/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722964,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/requires-changes","name":"requires-changes","color":"fef2c0","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2017-03-12T11:10:56Z","updated_at":"2017-10-02T21:02:04Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/13987","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13987","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13987.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13987.patch"},"body":"### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nCode cleanup in src/config.coffee file -

It was only after some trial and error and searching through the docs that I found the reason for the confusion was having multiple sources to each snippet. I feel this will make it a lit clearer.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nClearer understanding for new users who aren't familiar with Atom.

I wanted to get this up to get some eyes on it and discuss some stuff.

(z-index?)

We could abuse `serialize()` and do it there instead. (It shouldn't be in the serialized value though because we want it to be shared across workspaces.) That wouldn't be perfect either though, because if the same item was in different locations in two windows, we wouldn't know which was preferred. (Either way, we're still kinda making a \"best guess\" since split location isn't context-independent.)~\r\n    - Not worth it; leave it out for now\r\n  - ~Is there a more efficient storage mechanism than [putting stringified JSON in local storage][4]?~\r\n    - Use StateStore (this means `openItem()` will have to return a promise)\r\n- ~The open API doesn't currently have a way to ensure a new item is created. (It always searches at least the active pane of the center.) Does that matter?~\r\n  - Going to ignore until we have a use case\r\n- ~Is it weird to have some of the workspace API methods (`paneForURI()`, `paneForItem()`)* include the docks while others (`getActivePane()`) don't? Similarly, if `searchAllPanes` includes docks, what's the desired behavior when `searchAllPanes` is false? (Previously, I mistakenly thought it meant to search no panes, so there wasn't any question.)~\r\n  - `paneForURI()` and `paneForItem()` will include docks; active-related stuff won't. therefore, `searchAllPanes = true` will search docks, `false` (which only checks the active pane) won't\r\n  - a `workspace.getCenter()` will be added and return an instance of the new `WorkspaceCenter` class, which trivially wraps `workspace.paneContainer`\r\n\r\n* Oops, looks like I dropped the commit that updated those in a rebase. I'll add them back, depending on how we answer this question.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13977/files#diff-aed5b259cccd55443edaa7b93d0d2bb0R144\r\n[2]: https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13977/files#diff-aed5b259cccd55443edaa7b93d0d2bb0R166\r\n[3]: https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13977/files#diff-4f265837c9eeb2d4123aad469237b2a2R295\r\n[4]: https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13977/commits/29bf4c90200cfec9e348d6518a2968db2bb6eae0","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13977/reactions","total_count":12,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":9}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13976","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13976/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13976/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13976/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13976","id":213368884,"number":13976,"title":"Add `AtomEnvironment.prototype.resolveProxy(url)`","user":{"login":"as-cii","id":482957,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/482957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii","html_url":"https://github.com/as-cii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-03-10T15:21:57Z","updated_at":"2017-03-10T15:46:41Z","closed_at":"2017-03-10T15:46:39Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/13976","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13976","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13976.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13976.patch"},"body":"This new private API will allow settings-view to communicate asynchronously with the main process to resolve proxies instead of using `remote` and blocking the renderer process during startup.\r\n\r\n/cc: @atom/maintainers ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13976/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13975","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13975/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13975/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13975/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13975","id":213340797,"number":13975,"title":"Hello, Im having a issue with atom.

This happens with packages that do not seem to require any compiling. Moreover, all the required build tools _are_ installed:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbazzilic@BAZZILIC $ apm --version\r\napm  1.15.3\r\nnpm  3.10.5\r\nnode 4.4.5 ia32\r\npython 2.7.13\r\ngit 2.12.0.windows.1\r\nvisual studio 2015\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, `apm install --check` fails without stating exactly why.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open Atom (v1.15.0 ia32) on Windows 10 x64\r\n2. Try installing or updating any package. E.g., `atom-clock`, which (I checked) is pure JS and CSS, so doesn't need build tools.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** The package installs nicely.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1805832/23786861/3a6fa6e4-05aa-11e7-8b05-475bf8b69362.png)\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Always, since about a month ago\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n```\r\nbazzilic@BAZZILIC $ atom --version\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.15.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n```\r\n```\r\nbazzilic@BAZZILIC $ apm --version\r\napm  1.15.3\r\nnpm  3.10.5\r\nnode 4.4.5 ia32\r\npython 2.7.13\r\ngit 2.12.0.windows.1\r\nvisual studio 2015\r\n```\r\nRunning on Windows 10 Pro x64 (updated to Anniversary Edition). Visual Studio 2015 _with_ C/C++ compilers, with all latest updates. Reproduces on two different machines; both, however, are very similar software-wise.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\nI have tried backing up the `~/.atom/` folder and reinstalling Atom from scratch, but it didn't help. One more detail: `~/.atom/` is a symlink to a different location; if that's important.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13971/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13970","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13970/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13970/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13970/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13970","id":213227457,"number":13970,"title":"Refactor open; separate creation and placement of items","user":{"login":"matthewwithanm","id":126263,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/126263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm","html_url":"https://github.com/matthewwithanm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-03-10T02:44:17Z","updated_at":"2017-03-10T17:19:19Z","closed_at":"2017-03-10T17:19:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/13970","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13970","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13970.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13970.patch"},"body":"This is a refactoring that sets up the work for #13878 (docks).\r\n\r\nBecause items will be able to dictate their preferred locations, we need to detangle the item creation from their placement.\r\n\r\nI thought it was a little weird that the error was being thrown synchronously (instead of rejecting the returned promise), but there's a test that checks it so I kept it as-is.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13970/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13969","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13969/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13969/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13969/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13969","id":213210907,"number":13969,"title":"Should use name of symlink for determining file type (or have an option).","user":{"login":"lcrocker","id":199688,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/199688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcrocker","html_url":"https://github.com/lcrocker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcrocker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcrocker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcrocker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcrocker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcrocker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcrocker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcrocker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcrocker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcrocker/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true},{"id":505038679,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-03-10T00:48:44Z","updated_at":"2017-03-10T18:32:06Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

Atom nicely follows the link, but the fact that the destination file isn't \".c\" causes it to not do any syntax highlighting or other language-specific stuff.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if it made that decision based on the name of the symlink, or perhaps only when the destintation file is of unknown type, or perhaps with an option setting.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Find, say, \"sample.c\" in your source directory.\r\n2. Rename it \"sample.c.notype\".\r\n3. Create a symbolic link \"sample.c\" to point to it.\r\n4. Open \"sample.c\" in Atom.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\n\r\nIt should be able to figure out that it's a C program.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\n\r\nIt doesn't.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\n\r\n100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.12.9\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\napm  1.12.9\r\nnpm  3.10.5\r\nnode 4.4.5\r\npython 2.7.12\r\ngit 2.7.4\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nAny additional information, configuration or data that might be necessary to reproduce the issue.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13969/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13968","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13968/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13968/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13968/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13968","id":213196033,"number":13968,"title":"Remove the buildTextEditor binding in workspace","user":{"login":"matthewwithanm","id":126263,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/126263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm","html_url":"https://github.com/matthewwithanm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-03-09T23:15:53Z","updated_at":"2017-03-10T00:04:02Z","closed_at":"2017-03-10T00:03:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/13968","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13968","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13968.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13968.patch"},"body":"The comment was actually no longer accurate since arrow functions aren't newable.
