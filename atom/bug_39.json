there, (again), last time i forgot to fill up the  template, so here it is !\r\n\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [X] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAbout 2 weeks ago now, the 'open with Atom' option in contextual menu (right click on file menu) won't work.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nWell idk how to reproduce that ....\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Open the file/folder i selected in the Atom editor\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Open the Windows menu to select a \"default\" application to open it with, if i reclick \"atom\", closes the window and opens the same one again\r\nbtw i noticed that there were no Atom icon on the side of that option -> missing shortcut or smth ? \r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Well 100% of the time sadly ...\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nI might be doing this wrong but \"atom --version\" wont work, saying that it does not recognise atom as a program, same for \"apm --version\". I'm currently running on W10 x64 Family.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nUntil the moment it \"broke\" everything was running fine, i could use this option both on files and folders. \r\n+did not install other packages, etc ...\r\n\r\nthese are the screeshots of what i'm describing above, the seconds shows \"atom.cmd\" as default prog, that's because i saw smwhere it could fix the pb, (it did not) and of couse it has exacltly the same behavior as if i selected \"atom\"

https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen starting atom from the command line, it seems some options have to be specified after the file path. This is not documented AFAICT.\r\n\r\nSpecifically I found that `--enable-gpu-rasterization` cannot come before the file path (as specified in `--help` usage, it only works correctly when it comes after).\r\n\r\nI found this when reading and attempting workarounds for: \r\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12634\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Make sure you close all atom windows and quit atom completely.\r\n2.

I think they shouldn't show up in the search results.\r\n\r\nA workaround is to simply copy the `.gitignore` contents of the parent directory into the `subproject` directory, but I think this is an Atom bug that should be addressed.\r\n\r\nScreenshots to make everything clearer:\r\n\r\nRoot project, everything is good:\r\n\r\n![parent-project-search](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/787566/26588842/5f61bb0c-454e-11e7-8ead-da00e2f4e836.png)\r\n![parent-project](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/787566/26588844/5f656bee-454e-11e7-9c78-098e62cf4795.png)\r\n\r\nSubproject, the search shows results that should be omitted:\r\n\r\n![subproject](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/787566/26588841/5f423156-454e-11e7-88eb-c5520165624c.png)\r\n![subproject-search](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/787566/26588843/5f659164-454e-11e7-8f4a-a4f68b2eb1eb.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Setup a git repository with a `.gitignore` like described above. [I made one here](https://github.com/vladvelici/atom-gitignore-bug-report-sample-repo)\r\n2. Open the project, observe the tree file navigation sidebar and the search for the git ignored files.\r\n3.

The problem is when docks were introduced many core features (such as the tree-view) were put into panes. Because of this the packages/items (like the tree-view) are marking their containing pane as active which causes certain pieces of functionality to not work as expected. As an example of this there was: [find-and-replace issue #901](https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace/issues/901) which was solved by forcing the find-and-replace package to always use the center pane (`atom.workspace.getCenter().getActiveTextEditor()`).\r\n\r\nMy proposed solution is to update the way that panes are activated. Currently when an item is activated inside of a pane it displays that item in the editor in it's corresponding pane. This does a few things:\r\n  1. Focuses the activated item in it's pane (Potentially changing tabs)\r\n  2. Shows the dock that the pane is contained in (if applicable)\r\n  3. Marks the pane as active\r\n\r\nCurrently when you create/show a pane item you only have the option of either doing all 3 of these things or none of these things. I propose that we add another option which would be to allow a \"soft-activate\" which essentially does all of these things but the \"final\" step. The decision for whether or not a pane item is activated or \"soft-activated\" would potentially rely on a new config that can be passed when the pane item is created to mark it's \"type.\" This would allow for both displaying items properly but not causing them to be considered when the `atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor()` method is triggered. This prevents items like the tree-view from being \"activated\" while also allowing them to be properly displayed.\r\n\r\nBecause of the scope of this change it would likely need to be done in a few stages.  The stages that seemed to work best in my overview were these;\r\n  0. Change activation to be item based rather than pane based. But keeping the item's pane as what is returned in api functions (I.E. `atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor()`) as it does currently.\r\n  1. Implement the api change (defaulting to normal activation functionality)\r\n  2. Update the atom-flight-manual to document this new api change.\r\n  3. Start with editing the tree-view to work with this new feature.\r\n  4. Slowly convert other necessary core-packages to use this feature.\r\n\r\nThis should allow a fairly smooth transition and keep docks, panes, and Atom working as expected.\r\n\r\nPotential issues:\r\n  1. Making sure pane items cannot be \"activated\" regardless of pane.\r\n  2. Being able to properly differentiate and document the differences between (activated, soft-activated, and not-activated)\r\n  3.
