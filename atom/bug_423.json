None that i found mentioned this though.\n\nI feel like Atom is a bit too project-centric when, contextually, it can be cleverer. As we all know it takes some time to load up a new window, but loading a file in an existing window is fast. A lot of the time, I'll drag a file into Atom to load it, and Atom always loads up a new window if the file is outside of an existing open project's root. I feel that if a file is double clicked, opened from the command line or is dragged to the dock icon then this should still be the behaviour, but if the file is dragged onto a specific window, it should just open up in that window and save the load time. Yes, it'll be out of context, but it's not exactly breaking user expectations to open a file in the window is was dragged into, in my opinion.\n\nI know this is very much catered to my way of working, but I feel it won't affect people negatively for this behaviour to be in Atom, and will affect people like me very positively.\n\nThoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3083/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3082","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3082/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3082/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3082/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3082","id":38708265,"number":3082,"title":"Using 'sudo atom' can cause application errors due to root permissions on new compile-cache files","user":{"login":"bentolor","id":588260,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/588260?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bentolor","html_url":"https://github.com/bentolor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bentolor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bentolor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bentolor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bentolor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bentolor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bentolor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bentolor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bentolor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bentolor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"kevinsawicki","id":671378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/671378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinsawicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"assignees":[{"login":"kevinsawicki","id":671378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/671378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinsawicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true}],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2014-07-25T08:29:45Z","updated_at":"2015-01-08T19:09:19Z","closed_at":"2015-01-08T19:09:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Just a moment ago I stumbled upon a similar issue to #3056. As a background: I do like atom so much, that I started it to use it as a drop-in replacement for gedit. Even to edit system configuration files. In this scenario it's quite common to invoke editors via sudo.\n\nAtom will start in a broken state if you it was previously launched i.e with something like `sudo atom /etc/hosts`,  because in this case `$HOME` still points the original user directory, though the process is started under root privileges. This seems to be [a distribution specific default behavior of sudo](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/18399). \n\nAs result **any file created** in this Atom session will become unwriteable for the original user and will lead to application errors inside Atom: \n\n```\n[30615:0724/202223:INFO:CONSOLE(29)] \"Error: EACCES, permission denied '/home/ben/.atom/compile-cache/less/62b7a669af25a948e0632eac5cb2bf860f9c0e6e/imports.json'\n```\n\nTo be honest: You are able run into similar issues on other programs too, but most of them tend not to create new files unless triggered. I'm not aware which actions trigger Atom to create new files under `$HOME` _after the initial first launch_ for a user.\n### Steps to reproduce\n1. Start `atom` and exit\n2. `rm -r ~/.atom/compile-cache/less` to provoke Atom creating new files\n3. `sudo atom` and exit\n4. `atom`\n\nThis will be the case on all plattforms, where sudo keeps the original $HOME setting which can be tested i.e. by calling `sudo sh -c 'echo $HOME'`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3082/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3081","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3081/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3081/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3081/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3081","id":38707595,"number":3081,"title":"On Windows/French keymap it's not possible to write a closing bracket ']' character","user":{"login":"wakaDemo","id":4570424,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4570424?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wakaDemo","html_url":"https://github.com/wakaDemo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wakaDemo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wakaDemo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wakaDemo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wakaDemo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wakaDemo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wakaDemo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wakaDemo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wakaDemo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wakaDemo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-07-25T08:24:54Z","updated_at":"2014-09-16T13:28:07Z","closed_at":"2014-07-25T13:05:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"On Windows (8) and french keymap, the closing bracket is done with alt-gr + ')' key.\n\nHowever, pressing alt-gr + ')' to write ']' seems to be mapped to the \"fold function\" command instead.

For example a Mac Cmd key is in the same physical location as a Windows Alt key.  To make a set of Windows bindings that mimic Mac Cmd bindings one would use Alt.
