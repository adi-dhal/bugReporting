trying to use [Mocha](mochajs.org) for Atom package specs and have hit several obstacles in my way.\n\nThe ultimate goal of this is to achieve test coverage for package specs using [coffee-coverage](https://github.com/benbria/coffee-coverage). And I just prefer Mocha over Jasmine in general.\n\nUsing custom test runner (#8968) with the following `atomTestRunner` file:\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/mrodalgaard/8961e8760e6c408350f9\n- [x] **Spec window does not open in devMode**\n  Opened spec window when using `Window:Run Package Specs` starts in non-development mode even though Atom is in development mode. So I have to force it into devMode by redirecting the url - very ugly. Setting devMode on `applicationDelegate` did nothing and setting devMode on the atom global seems to be too late for package load paths (`packages.packageDirPaths`).\n  --- Fixed in #9476 ---\n- [x] **Package using activationCommands does not activate**\n  Currently I'm just testing this on the [default package](https://github.com/atom/package-generator) modified for Mocha and Chai expect. The problem is that the `activatePackage` promise never resolves even though the package seems to load. This works with Jasmine without the custom test runner. And when I remove `activationCommands` from package.json it resolves and Mocha runs the tests successfully.\n  --- Fixed by not returning a promise in Mocha's beforeEach ---\n\n``` coffee\nbeforeEach ->\n  workspaceElement = atom.views.getView(atom.workspace)\n  # With activationCommands this never resolves\n  activationPromise = atom.packages.activatePackage('demo-package')\n```\n- [x] **Content Security Policy on 'unsafe-eval'**\n  [coffee-coverage](https://github.com/benbria/coffee-coverage) ultimately fails on eval because the spec window is opened with restrictive Content-Security-Policy. [electron issue](https://github.com/atom/electron/issues/3430) and [atom PR](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/1702) mentions this, but I could not see how `allowUnsafeEval` could be set by the developer.\n  --- Fixed by using [loophole package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/loophole) even though is feels like a hack ---\n- [ ] **Coverage runs, but reports 0%**\n  Files that are wrapped by coverage (Esprima and Escodegen) are apparently not the ones being run by Atom or a child process is spawned before tests run like hinted to [here](https://github.com/benbria/coffee-coverage/issues/60).\n\nUsing Mac OSX 10.11.1, Atom 1.2.4 and Atom 1.3.0-beta6.\n\nApologize for the long post, but I felt it all belonged here to get the full picture.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9859/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9858","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9858/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9858/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9858/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9858","id":119301021,"number":9858,"title":"can't
