I had been doing this for 5 months when I was developing node-webkit, so this is no big problem.\n\nAnother thing is that because I will use a forked Chromium instead of the official one, the way you update the CEF shipped with Atom will change. I will update the `script/update-cef`.\n## Questions\n\nThere are at least two repositories needed to be maintained, the forked chromium and the forked node. Should we host them under github.com/github?\n\nAnd I think many people would be interested in a CEF that integrated with node API, should we make it public after it becomes stable?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/164/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/163","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/163/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/163/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/163/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/163","id":10258575,"number":163,"title":"indent region","user":{"login":"thedaniel","id":1476,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel","html_url":"https://github.com/thedaniel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2013-01-24T01:35:41Z","updated_at":"2013-09-03T03:57:58Z","closed_at":"2013-09-03T03:55:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I would like to be able to select a region and hit a key or run something from the command panel to auto-indent the whole thing based on the indent level of the first line.\n\n![indent-region](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1476/92264/260262d8-65c6-11e2-8e99-e6661e9a23ed.gif)\n\n@probablycorey pointed me in the direction of `suggestedIndentForBufferRow()` and when I get time i'll probably try using that in a function in my own atom config, but i think it's a generally useful feature.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/162","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/162/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/162/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/162/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/162","id":10255409,"number":162,"title":"Add Sparkle Support","user":{"login":"probablycorey","id":596,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/596?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey","html_url":"https://github.com/probablycorey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2013-01-23T23:29:57Z","updated_at":"2013-01-23T23:30:04Z","closed_at":"2013-01-23T23:30:03Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/162","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/162","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/162.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/162.patch"},"body":"Atom binaries can be automatically updated (via Speakeasy)!\n\nCurrently we download updates in the background and install on quit.
