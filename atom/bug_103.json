Description\n\nSoft Wrapping ignores \"Cr\" and \"Eol\"  even when show invisibles are switched on.\nThis is especially evident when using Japanese. (The following Steps are examined in Japanese)\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Make sure \"Soft Wrap\" and \"Show Invisibles\" are on from [Setting] -> [Editor]\n2. Type in any Japanese Character such as \"あ\" repetitively until it reachs the second line. ( As soft wrap is on, the second line here means the first line with a \"dot\" as the line number) \n3. Move the cursor to the first letter in the second line and change lines there.\n\nThe problem occurs here. the Soft Wrap does not recognize the \"Cr\" and \"Eol\" and the line ends in the midst of the two invisibles and a scroll bar for sideways appear.\nAs a result, when you try to edit the end of the first line, the window moves sideways, causing a annoying shaking.\n\n![screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22351407/18748387/f15547c4-810c-11e6-957c-ec643d10bbb1.png)\n### Versions\n\nAtom 1.10.2 is running on Windows 10\n\nI have tried

we were always mistakenly returning `[(0, 0), (0, 0)]`, thus causing the first line of a file to be constantly invalidated. This caused also a performance regression for long lines with lots of highlight decorations at row 0, because any change in the buffer at other rows caused that line to be re-rendered and, therefore, re-measured as well.

Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n\nFor more information on how to write a good [bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) or [enhancement request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\nMoving lines or blocks of text around with Move Line Up/Down (CTRL+Up/Down) in python messes with the indentation. The code block gets indented to match the indentation of the block just above, assuming you want to nest it there. In general this results in code you have to re-indent back after moving. \n\n![optimised](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1453692/18712371/6b316ce4-800e-11e6-9e52-aaeee5845d1f.gif)\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. In a python script, select a line or block of text. \n2. Move it around with CTRL+Up/Down so it is below an indented line, e.g. a function. \n\n**Expected behavior:** The block of text is moved with its indentation preserved\n\n**Actual behavior:** The indentation matches that of the line just above. \n### Versions\n\nYou can get this information from executing `atom --version` and `apm --version` at the command line.

You can save the file with a select file extension or manually select a syntax but cannot set the default syntax for new documents. An official init.coffee solution exists on the [Atom FAQ](https://discuss.atom.io/t/how-can-i-make-all-new-files-open-with-a-specific-grammar-or-syntax/20754) however new documents still default to \"Plain Text\" and rather only opening a new tab defaults to the desired syntax:\n\n```\natom.workspace.observeTextEditors (editor) ->\n  if editor.getTitle() is \"untitled\"\n    editor.setGrammar(atom.grammars.grammarForScopeName('text.html.php'))\n```\n\nOther developers have noted the bug appears to be, \"Open Empty Editor On Start option enabled is required as this issue only occurs on the first editor created by that option.\"\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Edit init.coffee with above code\n2. Restart Atom\n3. Open Atom and notice default syntax is still Plain Text\n\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]\nDefault syntax (based on above code) should be PHP\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\nIt is still Plain Text (unless you open another tab via shortcut or Menu). Opening New Window view menu or shortcut also results in same issue.\n### Versions\n\n1.10.2, Mac 10.12
