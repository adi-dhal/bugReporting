To Do\n- [x] Give tiles opaque backgrounds\n- [x] Support mouse-wheel velocity scrolling over tiles\n- [ ] Cursors\n- [ ] Highlight decorations\n- [ ] Support line decoration options\n- [ ] Change batching strategy\n  - [ ] Try to get scrolling smoother\n  - [ ] Support < 16ms response time for typing and cursor movement\n- [ ] Foldable indicators in gutter, computed in `TokenizedBuffer`\n- [ ] Fix the component specs (much of the heavy lifting is in the presenter now)\n- [ ] Fix overlayer shims\n- [ ] Figure out what to do about the underlayer\n## Underlayer Deprecation\n\nOpaque tiles improve performance, but they destroy the previous ability to attach absolutely-positioned elements to the underlayer and have things just work. Based on [this search](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=editorView+underlayer&type=Code&ref=searchresults), the following packages access the `.underlayer` outlet on the editor. Checkboxes are for adding the necessary APIs and creating issues/PRs on the package repositories:\n\nCould use highlight decorations instead:\n- [x] https://github.com/richrace/highlight-selected (https://github.com/richrace/highlight-selected/issues/17)\n- [ ] https://github.com/mlitbk/column-overflow\n- [ ] https://github.com/yujinakayama/atom-lint\n- [ ] https://github.com/atom/bracket-matcher\n- [ ] https://github.com/atom/spell-check\n\nCould use highlight decorations if we allowed arbitrary style assignment:\n- [ ] https://github.com/wonnage/highlight-css-color\n\nCould potentially use highlight decorations if we added a `fullHeight` and `fullWidth` option:\n- [ ] https://github.com/tony612/highlight-column\n- [ ] https://github.com/jtanner/crosshairs\n- [x] https://github.com/richrace/highlight-line (https://github.com/richrace/highlight-line/issues/23)\n\nCould attach to the overlayer instead:\n- [ ] https://github.com/Problematic/omni-ruler\n- [ ] https://github.com/atom/wrap-guide\n\nExtend the old editor in unsupported ways that probably don't work with the new editor:\n- https://github.com/anson0370/scroll-past-end\n- https://github.com/mlitbk/center-screen\n## Background\n\nI'll explain more as this develops, but I'm experimenting with a new rendering strategy for the editor that's yielding promising results on Chromium 36. I've tried this before and closed it, but things are going better on this newer rendering engine and a bit more maturity in the `EditorComponent` code. The current rendering strategy exhibits some pretty serious performance regression on Chromium 36, so some kind of optimization work is something of a blocker for shipping it.\n\nHere's a look at the composited layer borders in orange.\n\n![screenshot 2014-08-01 16 41 27](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1789/3785952/031bacd6-19cd-11e4-960e-7b884a7b48e2.png)\n\nHere's a promising timeline of scrolling around at moderate speed, showing we're meeting most of our frame times with room to spare at 60 FPS.\n\n![screenshot 2014-08-01 10 12 18](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1789/3785973/9825c032-19cd-11e4-93eb-569adbab0239.png)\n\nI'm also pretty close clearing 13ms frame times for cursor movement (which is what I have my key repeat rate set at so it's important to me) with a different strategy for requesting frames. I wish I could supply `requestAnimationFrame` with my desired frame time for a given request. For now I'm hoping a synchronous rendering strategy for certain operations will suffice.\n\nYou never really know until it's fully implemented, but this is promising. The gutter is disabled because it's not yet tiled, and the cursors and highlight decorations (responsible for selections, among other things) haven't been fully implemented yet. But I'm feeling pretty good.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3153","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3153/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3153/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3153/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3153","id":39332287,"number":3153,"title":"Soft wrap doesn't indent to match starting line's indentation","user":{"login":"trevordmiller","id":5497885,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5497885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevordmiller","html_url":"https://github.com/trevordmiller","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevordmiller/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevordmiller/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevordmiller/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevordmiller/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevordmiller/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevordmiller/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevordmiller/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevordmiller/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevordmiller/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-08-01T22:16:34Z","updated_at":"2014-08-02T07:51:00Z","closed_at":"2014-08-02T07:51:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Would it be possible to have line wrappings auto indent to match their starting line's indentation?

(and up) seem to be pretty buggy (and slow).  I will try to summarize the different issues I've come across (some are enhancements depending on your perspective):\n- move-line-down with cursor in column 0.  Then press undo.  The cursor will start going down below the buffer and exceptions will start being thrown from tokenized-buffer.\n- Select entire penultimate line, won't allow you to move it down (whether or not there is a trailing newline at EOF).\n- Moving folds will cause it to unfold (and generally cause lots of problems).  The fold markers can be corrupted if you try to undo.\n- Moving lines past a fold can cause it to unfold and have issues.\n- Slow with large number of lines (issue #3128).\n- Only supports 1 cursor (issue #2470).\n\nI attempted to rewrite the moveLineDown function, and solved most of these issues except for the undo problems (which became much worse due to my approach).  Generally, undo gets very confused if you have `selection.setBufferRange` or `editor.createFold` in conjunction with insert/delete.  The only reason I can see that rebuilding the selection or the folds is necessary is because there is no way to insert text just before the cursor without it becoming part of the selection or fold.\n\nIf someone can point me towards a way to insert just before a selection or fold without the text becoming part of that selection or fold, then I can simplify the code and not run into any undo problems.  Alternatively, perhaps it is a bug that undo can cause problems, but that may be more difficult for me to know how to fix properly.\n\nI can provide more details or test code if desired.\n\nI tossed my initial prototype up here: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/aaaa9ec5bb642dab8d26\n\natom 0.121\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3135/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3134","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3134/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3134/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3134/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3134","id":39137480,"number":3134,"title":"Remove .off and .unsubscribe from the API","user":{"login":"nathansobo","id":1789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo","html_url":"https://github.com/nathansobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":118249520,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/api","name":"api","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-07-30T21:10:51Z","updated_at":"2014-09-10T19:19:18Z","closed_at":"2014-09-10T19:19:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We always return an object with an `.off` method for each particular subscription, which is a much more controlled approach.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3134/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3133","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3133/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3133/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3133/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3133","id":39137399,"number":3133,"title":"Remove namespace support from the event system","user":{"login":"nathansobo","id":1789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo","html_url":"https://github.com/nathansobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":118249520,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/api","name":"api","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-07-30T21:09:52Z","updated_at":"2015-04-13T21:02:26Z","closed_at":"2015-04-13T21:02:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Namespaces add extra complexity and are in general a bad idea.

will be using biscotto to generate the [metadata](https://gist.github.com/benogle/dc81fc7bb841e5926258). This format is super raw. The doc strings are not parsed, the links to other classes are not resolved, and there is a lot in there that will not end up in the docs.\n\nI think we should build something to translate the biscotto format into a json document that closely mirrors the structure of the HTML docs. The doc strings will be parsed, external libs will be pulled in (eg. text-buffer) and the links to other classes will be resolved (to some degree). It should be such that the thing consuming the format can be a really dumb HTML generator requiring very little state.\n\nThis should give us options when creating an html generator. Atom.io can have a generator that first indexes the document, then integrates the docs into the site. We might create a static generator for projects like atom/highlights, atom/text-buffer, or the docs locally in atom.\n## Proposed Format\n\n``` coffee\nclasses: [{\n  name: \"Editor\":\n  superClass: 'Object'\n  description: \"\"\"\n    The description of editor...\n  \"\"\"\n  properties: [{\n    name: 'isFocused'\n    type: 'Bool'\n    status: 'Essential'\n    srcURL: 'https://github.com/atom/atom/master/....#L10-L20'\n    summary: '`true` when the [Editor](Editor) is focused'\n    description: \"\"\"\n      `true` when the [Editor](Editor) is focused\n    \"\"\"\n  }],\n  classProperties: [...]\n  events: [{\n    name: 'title-changed'\n    section: '?Do we need a section for events?'\n    status: 'Essential'\n    srcURL: 'https://github.com/atom/atom/master/....#L2-L5'\n    summary: 'Emitted when the title changes. See [path-changed](#path-changed)'\n    description: \"\"\"\n      Emitted when the title changes. See [path-changed](#path-changed)\n    \"\"\"\n    arguments: [{ # maybe should be callbackArguments?\n      name: 'newTitle',\n      description: '{String} new title of the editor',\n      type: 'String'\n    }]\n  }],\n  methods: [{\n    name: 'moveDown(lineCount)'\n    section: 'Cursor Movement'\n    status: 'Essential'\n    srcURL: 'https://github.com/atom/atom/master/....#L221-L223'\n    summary: 'My awesome method that does stuff.'\n    description: \"\"\"\n      Move the cursors down `lineCount` lines.\n      See [moveUp](#moveUp)\" or maybe [TextBuffer](TextBuffer#someMethod)\"\n    \"\"\"\n    arguments:[{\n      name: 'lineCount',\n      description: '{Number} number of lines the cursor will to move down',\n      type: 'Number'\n    }]\n    examples: [\n      'moveDown()'\n      'moveDown(20)'\n    ]\n    returnValue: [{\n      type: 'Bool',\n      description: 'Returns a {Bool}; true when it does the thing'\n    }],\n  }]\n  classMethods: [...]\n}, {\n  name: \"Marker\":\n  superClass: 'Model'\n  description: \"...\"\n},{\n  ...\n}]\n```\n#### Status\n\nAll `status` fields will be `Essential` or `Extended`.\n#### Markdown\n\nAll fields worthy of display will be in markdown format.\n#### Links\n\nLinks will be in markdown format as relative links within the doc. If the html generator sees a link in this format, it should resolve it to whatever structure it is using to generate pages.\n\n```\n[some-event](#some-event)\n[::someMethod](#someMethod)\n[TextBuffer](TextBuffer)\n[TextBuffer::someMethod](TextBuffer#someMethod)\n```\n#### Inline source\n\nWe talked about inlining the method source code in the docs. We could just include the code with in each of the method objects.\n\n_But_ I feel like we should keep it simple, and just link to the source for now. Inlining the source can be a feature we add later.\n## FEEDback\n\nTell me what you guys think. Especially @thedaniel as he will be consuming and indexing it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4731","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"DE83:3670:A0DA47:19E800A:59D92D27","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=422>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=420>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"d4745eb72fd165ce7a07305500c66685\"","status":"200 OK"}}
