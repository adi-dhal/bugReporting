https://github.com/atom/fuzzy-finder/issues/37\n\n> If you have opened up the Command Palette (Command-Shift-P) in Atom v.0.92.0, and then switch to another app, say the Mac OS X Terminal app to run something you've been working on, the Command Palette is gone when you switch back (this is also true of this \"Send us feedback\" drop-down pane). It would be preferable if, on switching back to the Atom app v.0.92.0, that the Command Palette were still open where you left it.\n\nI've noticed this myself, but never fund it particularly annoying. Also, some other dialogs are affected by this as well, such as the fuzzy finder. Unsure if this is something that's handled on a per-package basis or in Atom core, so opened an issue here. :pizza: \n- It seems that SublimeText doesn't have consistent behavior with these dialogs -- the command palette is closed similar to Atom, but the fuzzy finder is not (it stays open even after the app loses focus).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1918/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1917","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1917/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1917/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1917/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/1917","id":32678591,"number":1917,"title":"Triggering Markdown preview with split panes throws an error","user":{"login":"izuzak","id":38924,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/38924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak","html_url":"https://github.com/izuzak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"kevinsawicki","id":671378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/671378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinsawicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"assignees":[{"login":"kevinsawicki","id":671378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/671378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinsawicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-05-02T09:21:13Z","updated_at":"2014-05-05T18:36:24Z","closed_at":"2014-05-05T18:36:24Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Reported via Twitter: https://twitter.com/sbellware/status/462009964634972160\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.
