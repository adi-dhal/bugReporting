https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10286#issuecomment-216063073, but it seems that user didn't open an issue for it.\n### Description\n\nWhen adding a folder to an existing atom window with `atom -a [directory]`, Atom gets stuck indexing. That is, trying to open a file with `Cmd+P` will just show this:\n\n![users rahat downloads temp 2016-06-17 19-55-45](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3174006/16168161/874d70d8-34c5-11e6-98ac-f5bc84d1c14f.png)\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Setup minimal test case\n\n``` sh\nmkdir dir1 dir2\ntouch dir1/file1.txt dir2/file2.txt\n```\n1. Open first safe atom window (make sure atom isn't running at this point)\n\n``` sh\natom --safe dir1\n```\n\nAt this point, indexing works fine and you can use `Cmd+P` as expected.\n1. Add a project to the window\n\n``` sh\natom -a dir2\n```\n\n**Expected behavior:** For the indexing to finish and files of both projects to be searchable.\n\n**Actual behavior:** The popup says `Indexing project...` forever, like in the above screenshot\n### Versions\n\n``` sh\natom --version\nAtom    : 1.8.0\nElectron: 0.36.8\nChrome  : 47.0.2526.110\nNode    : 5.1.1\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12000/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11999","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11999/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11999/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11999/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11999","id":160897562,"number":11999,"title":"js写注释时中文输入法不能输入","user":{"login":"ChangeZhang","id":6948367,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6948367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChangeZhang","html_url":"https://github.com/ChangeZhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChangeZhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChangeZhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChangeZhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChangeZhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChangeZhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChangeZhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChangeZhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChangeZhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChangeZhang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-06-17T14:13:10Z","updated_at":"2016-07-10T05:42:57Z","closed_at":"2016-06-17T15:56:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [ ] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode)?\n- [ ] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [ ] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [ ] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [ ] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [ ] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n\nFor more information on how to write a good [bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) or [enhancement request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\n[Description of the bug or feature]\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.

Instead of relying on a `season` internal module, with this pull-request we simply verify that the CSON module gets called appropriately and avoid testing its caching/parsing behavior again in Atom (i.e. it's already tested in https://github.com/atom/season/blob/master/spec/cson-spec.coffee#L207).\n\nI am not clear on why Janky cannot find that internal module (maybe npm got updated there and the module is now flattened?), but it felt reasonable to avoid this anti-pattern in the spec so that we can make it more bulletproof independently of which npm version our CI is running.\n\n/cc:
