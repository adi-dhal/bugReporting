token is simply a common pattern of what we'd like to search (for example, instead of using a regex pattern representing a word, a number, a tab, a break, etc. we could insert a token that represents the same thing).\n\nIn OS X's built in find/replace (available in TextEdit and Notes, for example), although it's not possible to use regex we can use the following tokens to represent commons patterns:\n![screen shot 2016-01-01 at 18 12 39](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3199157/12071731/4a39ff04-b0b3-11e5-8a62-07659c21eae6.png)\n\nUsing tokens is easier than having to remember common used regex patterns for a simple find and replace. Also, a great common use case for this is to use the result of the pattern searched when replacing. For example, imagine you have a text like this:\n\n```\nyou thank\ndiem carpe\npython monty\n```\n\nAnd you'd like to find in the text WORD1 WORD2 and replace matches with WORD2 WORD1. The resulting text would be:\n\n```\nthank you\ncarpe diem\nmonty python\n```\n\nSimply inserting the same tokens in the Replace field would allow to find and replace WORD1 WORD2 with WORD2 WORD1. This is achievable in the aforementioned OS X's find/replace feature and is presented like this:\n![screen shot 2016-01-01 at 18 09 31](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3199157/12071733/714be76a-b0b3-11e5-8578-20f6138088f4.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10246/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10245","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10245/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10245/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10245/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10245","id":124541997,"number":10245,"title":"Cannot install ATOM in windows ","user":{"login":"sasitha","id":2566595,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2566595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasitha","html_url":"https://github.com/sasitha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasitha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasitha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasitha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasitha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasitha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasitha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasitha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasitha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasitha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-01-01T11:33:18Z","updated_at":"2016-01-01T16:25:42Z","closed_at":"2016-01-01T16:25:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I can't install ATOM in my windows laptop\n\nIEnableLogger: Failed to install package to app dir: System.IO.PathTooLongException: The specified path, file name, or both are too long.

Reproducible in safe mode too. If new window open without any project folder or project folder is git repository, everything works perfectly well.\n#### System info\n\nOS X El Capitan 10.11.2 (15C50)\nIntel Core i5 2.4 GHz, 4 GB\n\nAtom version: 1.3.2\n#### Steps to reproduce:\n1. Open atom in non-git project folder\n\n``` shell\n$ cd developer\n$ atom --safe .\n```\n1. Once editor is open, create new tab and start typing any text, e.g.\n\n```\nsdfljsdflj\nsdfljsdflj\nsdfljsdfljsdf\nsdflj sdfljsdf sdfljsdf sdfljsdf\nsflj sdfljsdflj sdfljdslf sdflj\nsdfljsdf sdfljdsfljsdf sdfljsdf \nsdfljsdf sdflj sdfljsdf sdfljsadfj sdfljsdf sdfljl sdf\n```\n1. You will notice how atom starts responding with delays, cpu goes up to 100%, and memory consumption increases. Agree, it sounds a little bit random, but it does not seem to be related to whether it is simple plain text or syntax highlight selected. The same behaviour observed with editing **.py** file with python syntax highlighting on.\n#### Reports\n\nDeveloper console does not show any errors, I tried recording profile:\n![cpu-profile](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7788766/12047969/3ea345e0-af39-11e5-9e51-59b9effbab1c.jpg)\n\n[CPU-20151230T204350.cpuprofile.zip](https://github.com/atom/atom/files/74680/CPU-20151230T204350.cpuprofile.zip)\n\nI appreciate any help on this issue, any apologies if it is just me doing something wrong with atom.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10221/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10220","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10220/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10220/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10220/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10220","id":124316374,"number":10220,"title":"Atom freezes when opening two files with the same folder/name but different parent folders ","user":{"login":"vinodpanicker","id":124241,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/124241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodpanicker","html_url":"https://github.com/vinodpanicker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodpanicker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodpanicker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodpanicker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodpanicker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodpanicker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodpanicker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodpanicker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodpanicker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodpanicker/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-12-30T07:49:53Z","updated_at":"2016-01-04T08:15:29Z","closed_at":"2015-12-30T14:30:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"_Atom freezes when opening two files with the same folder/name but different parent folders_\n\nThe folder structure is a below \n\n0 .
