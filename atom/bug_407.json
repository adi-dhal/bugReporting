Another is to pop them out of the Atom window, but that gets confusing if you have multiple windows open.\n\nIt would be nice to have some kind of \"invisible\" devtools mode where it will still capture stacktraces (and do whatever else it does), but otherwise have the editor work normally.

had some problems with the scroll bars in more recent releases.  I posted the issues in the atom discussion board (https://discuss.atom.io/t/scroll-bars-are-missing/12152) and was directed to post here.\n\nThe issues:\n- When code lines in a given file extend beyond the preferred line length, the vertical scroll bar does not appear.  If the file is edited so that no lines extend beyond the preferred line length, the vertical scroll bar immediately appears.\n- The horizontal scroll bar is only present when scrolled all the way to the bottom of a file.\n\nThese problems have occurred for me since at least v0.127.0 (and possibly older) on Mac OS X 10.9.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3559/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3558","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3558/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3558/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3558/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3558","id":42961397,"number":3558,"title":"normalizeIndentOnPaste deletes indent","user":{"login":"jwalton","id":1771003,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1771003?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwalton","html_url":"https://github.com/jwalton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwalton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwalton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwalton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwalton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwalton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwalton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwalton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwalton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwalton/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-09-17T04:00:10Z","updated_at":"2015-09-15T19:46:26Z","closed_at":"2015-09-15T19:46:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"`normalizeIndentOnPaste` is supposed to [convert tabs to spaces, or spaces to tabs](https://atom.io/docs/v0.59.0/customizing-atom#configuration-key-reference).

have an annoying behavior that prevents me to type the character \"]\". Instead it folds current-line.\n\nOn Azerty layout the ] can be typed with : AltGr + 0 .In the keybindings the current line folding should be triggered with Ctrl + Alt + ]. So there is some kind of conflict...\n\nThanks,\n\nAtom@0.127.0, Windows 7 FR, azerty keyboard layout\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3551/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3550","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3550/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3550/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3550/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3550","id":42840552,"number":3550,"title":"Atom cursor getBufferPosition and getScreenPosition return the same?","user":{"login":"ilanbiala","id":3695164,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3695164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilanbiala","html_url":"https://github.com/ilanbiala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilanbiala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilanbiala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilanbiala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilanbiala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilanbiala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilanbiala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilanbiala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilanbiala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilanbiala/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-09-16T03:10:25Z","updated_at":"2014-09-16T21:37:14Z","closed_at":"2014-09-16T03:16:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"In the console, I'm experimenting with cursor positions, and it seems that `.getBufferPosition()` and `.getScreenPosition()` return the same thing, even though the documentation says that `.getScreenPosition()` returns \"the screen position of the cursor as an Array.\" and `.getBufferPosition()` returns \"the current buffer position as an Array.\"\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3550/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4745","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"852E:3670:A0C918:19E50CD:59D92CF8","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=408>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=406>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"3491cc5d23c680840344c8edafb2b5fb\"","status":"200 OK"}}
