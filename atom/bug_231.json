I have the version 1.0.15 installed on Windows 10. It runs fine a while but it keeps crashing when I run my Julia code always at the same place. I don't know if it is an issue with the packages or with Atom. How can I find out what causes the crash / freeze?\n\nThanks\nSerge\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8870/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8869","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8869/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8869/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8869/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8869","id":107402637,"number":8869,"title":"questions: key shortcut and start","user":{"login":"crper","id":8272877,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8272877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crper","html_url":"https://github.com/crper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crper/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-09-20T16:31:52Z","updated_at":"2015-09-20T17:06:04Z","closed_at":"2015-09-20T17:05:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"1.why key shortcut use webstorm double cilck change…\n2.default disable all plugins keyshortcut ，show key exec command at readme，users  control on/off（like checkbox）\n\n3.atom start time very slow （compare for sublime）……next version can reduce start time？\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8868","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8868/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8868/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8868/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8868","id":107397564,"number":8868,"title":"Packages that add a popup at the bottom of the editor can hide my cursor","user":{"login":"shawninder","id":484730,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/484730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawninder","html_url":"https://github.com/shawninder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawninder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawninder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawninder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawninder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawninder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawninder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawninder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawninder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawninder/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-09-20T15:15:29Z","updated_at":"2015-09-20T15:20:05Z","closed_at":"2015-09-20T15:20:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The simplest way to observe this is to write things near the bottom of a file and trigger `Project Find: Show`.
