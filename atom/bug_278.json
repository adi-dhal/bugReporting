Unless there is anything in Atom that requires Python version to be exactly 2.7.6 and pyenv for building it, the only effect this file would have is enforcing an old Python version on pyenv users.\n\nThere is a workaround, by overriding Python version with `pyenv shell`, but maybe the file could just be removed to avoid using this workaround for each build?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7450/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7449","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7449/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7449/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7449/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7449","id":91226793,"number":7449,"title":"Uncaught
