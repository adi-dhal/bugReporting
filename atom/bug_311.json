It's not about atom crashing or not crashing. It's about a myriad of other things crashing on a computer. It's about being able to not kill a junior because he or she accidentally hit the reset button on your computer. Sublime gives you the \"don't worry about it\" guarantee. It's a state of mind and affects your workflow. I was used to having many unnamed buffers open with random scratch data. I didn't need to save it anywhere but sublime kept them around.\n\n---\n\nFrom @maxbrunsfeld on https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/6380#issuecomment-94881588\n\n> I think this use case is covered though, because Atom should quit normally during a system restart (at least on OSX and Linux).\n\nNot when I hard reset my computer with a physical reset button which is quite accessible and happens to be right next to the USB ports.\n\n---\n\nOpen atom, type some text, and hit `Ctrl+Q`\n\n![screenshot from 2015-04-21 10 40 49](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/753919/7258673/e6d837c8-e812-11e4-8232-c4f8d736fb5c.png)\n\nI should not be able to lose work at all, at any time, for any reason. In sublime I can do the above and then immediately re-open and all is well.\n\n---\n\nTo summarize, we need a few things:\n- Save unnamed buffers when atom is closed normally\n- Porting the \"hot exit\" feature from sublime. When atom is closed, it is immediately closed without any popup and can be re-opened in the exact state it was left\n- On some configurable interval we save the state to allow the application to pick back up in case of fire\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6455/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6454","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6454/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6454/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6454/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6454","id":69887244,"number":6454,"title":"Distinguish whether a Marker is visible on screen (versus fully folded)","user":{"login":"jssln","id":1017111,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1017111?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jssln","html_url":"https://github.com/jssln","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jssln/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jssln/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jssln/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jssln/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jssln/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jssln/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jssln/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jssln/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jssln/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-04-21T16:12:23Z","updated_at":"2017-06-15T01:53:26Z","closed_at":"2017-06-15T01:53:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Here's a scenario to illustrate the problem:\n\nLet's say we create a Decoration on a certain Marker.

babel-core from 4.0.2 to 5.1.11.\n\nNote that this is a major version bump, so `babel.coffee` also had to be updated to reflect the minor API changes.\n\nNotable new features from the [changelog](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) since 4.0.2:\n- Add [trailing function comma proposal](https://github.com/jeffmo/es-trailing-function-commas).\n- Decorators based on [@wycat's stage 1 proposal](https://github.com/wycats).\n\nThere is a number of bug fixes and performance improvements, as well.\n\nOne new error that users are likely to run into is this one in subclass constructors that reference `this` but not `super`:\n\n```\n'this' is not allowed before super()\n```\n\nAs best I can tell, this was a recent-ish update to the ES6 constructor semantics spec that Babel is now enforcing: https://gist.github.com/allenwb/53927e46b31564168a1d. /cc
