v1.0.2\nNode: v0.12.6\nnpm: v2.5.1\nArchlinux (4.0.7-2-ARCH, x86_64)\n\nAt the building stage (script/build), the script ends at the following task without dumping any errors:\n\n`Running \"download-atom-shell\" task`\n\nIf you are facing on the same issue, it is probably due to a bug with the request module failing with users behind proxy (https://github.com/atom/node-github-releases/issues/2).\n\nYou can add the `--stack` option to the file `script/utils/run-grunt.js` to dump the hidden error to your console (@ the line 14):\n\n`var args = ['--gruntfile', path.resolve('build', 'Gruntfile.coffee'), '--stack'];`\n\nThen rebuild Atom thanks to the same command line `./script/build` will probably dump a similar error:\n\n```\nTypeError: Request path contains unescaped characters.\nâ€¦\n```\n\nI temporary fixed the issue by removing my *_proxy env variables (bash):\n\n`unset http_proxy https_proxy ftp_proxy HTTP_PROXY HTTPS_PROXY FTP_PROXY no_proxy NO_PROXY`\n\nand then everything goes well:\n\n```\nRunning \"download-atom-shell\" task\nRunning \"download-atom-shell-chromedriver\" task\nRunning \"build\" task\nRunning \"coffee:glob_to_multiple\" (coffee) task\n>> 333 files created.\nRunning \"prebuild-less:src\" (prebuild-less) task\nRunning \"cson:glob_to_multiple\" (cson) task\n>> 170 files compiled

task\nRunning \"set-version\" task\nRunning \"generate-asar\" task\nDone, without errors.\n```\n\nIt will be preferable to definitely fix the issue by replacing the version of the `tunnel-agent` package (https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/4569#issuecomment-62051308).\n\nThanks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8044","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8044/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8044/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8044/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8044","id":96825704,"number":8044,"title":"Links

I was able to see all installed packages in the atom gui. After the last upgrade, I only see 3 of them (see attached screenshot). This issue seems to have nothing to do with a skin (I resetted id and the problem persisted) or plugin (tested it without plugins, too), all plugins seem to run fine. If I search them in Settings -> Install I am able to configure their settings, too.
