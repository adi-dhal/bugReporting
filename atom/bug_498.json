may never get merged**, but I'm putting it out there as something to think about should we decide to transition back to thinking about some of our packages as \"tightly coupled\" to Atom core for a while.\n\n@kevinsawicki and I had a good talk last night that makes me doubt whether we need to do this. Here's the situation:\n\nOur ability to version packages independently of atom core basically hinges on the stability of our core API. If we're able to make backward-compatible changes to core, then there's no imperative to commit repairs to broken packages in lock-step with our core changes, because nothing will break. This will have to be our approach when we launch private alpha, because otherwise we'll break other people's packages in addition to our own. Core API stability will be a high priority.\n\nHowever, for the next two months we're going to make one last push to fix any outstanding issues with the design of our API. We may or may not be able to preserve backward compatibility for all packages during this transition. If it's easy to preserve, then I'm inclined to do so. But my top priority is getting the design in good shape as quickly as possible, so if backward compatibility is getting in the way, submoduling some or all of our core packages again _temporarily_ may be a good option. In this final push to improve the API before giving this to people, its stability is a low priority.\n\nI'm going to attempt the MVVM refactoring in a way that maximizes backward compatibility and make a small number of non-backward compatible changes directly on master. Depending on our experience in the coming weeks, we may discover we don't need to submodule. On the other hand, I think it could be expedient as a temporary measure while things are in massive flux. I promise to stop breaking the world when we release, but the world isn't how I want it yet.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/788","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/788/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/788/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/788/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/788","id":18949586,"number":788,"title":"Lock down requires","user":{"login":"kevinsawicki","id":671378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/671378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinsawicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2013-09-04T01:58:08Z","updated_at":"2013-09-23T23:03:49Z","closed_at":"2013-09-23T23:03:49Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"If packages can require anything from `src` then essentially everything in there is public.\n\nIf we want to prevent this we need to remove this folder from the require path and instead just export things that are in public API such as:\n\n``` coffeescript\n{Editor} = require 'atom'\n```\n\ninstead of:\n\n``` coffeescript\nEditor = require 'editor'\n```\n\nThis will also allow us more freedom to rename things internally without breaking backwards compatibility in packages.\n## Impact\n- Files in `src` and `spec` would start using relative require paths; `./text-buffer` instead of `text-buffer`\n- Need to decide how many top-level requires we have and what is in them.\n- Do we replace globals with this construct? i.e `{syntax, config} = require 'atom'`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/788/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/787","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/787/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/787/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/787/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/787","id":18944739,"number":787,"title":"Make ui-variables overridable/change base stylesheet loading procedure","user":{"login":"benogle","id":69169,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/69169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle","html_url":"https://github.com/benogle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":13,"created_at":"2013-09-03T23:16:07Z","updated_at":"2014-07-19T08:04:20Z","closed_at":"2013-09-04T20:56:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/787","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/787","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/787.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/787.patch"},"body":"A pull to implement #775.\n### Notes\n- Importable files are now in `/static/less-imports`.

Background\n\nLong ago CI was a bit flaky as we integrated the building of node modules and atom-shell into atom's build process.\n\nTo get it consistently building we decided to have `script/cibuild` be as aggressive as possible in deleting cached files between builds. Everything went, the coffee cache, the local `atom-shell` folder, cached atom-shell zips, the local `node_modules` folder, and the cache of previously downloaded modules.\n\nThings are now significantly less flaky; atom-shell tags releases, we are tagging and publishing our own atom packages, apm rebuilds native modules when atom-shell gets upgraded, and therefore I am proposing we now favor faster build times over a pristine atom build environment.\n\nThis will not impact the deploy script, we will still do the super clean and make sure everything builds with fresh copies of all the modules and atom-shell.\n# Results\n\nThe non-spec portion of atom's build goes from ~4 minutes to ~1 minute.\n\nThe last master build when this branch started was [380 seconds](https://janky.rs.github.com/atom/master), the latest build of this branch was [218 seconds](https://janky.rs.github.com/atom/less-clean).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/780","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/780/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/780/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/780/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/780","id":18822788,"number":780,"title":"Add #getUpstreamBranch to Git","user":{"login":"jasonrudolph","id":2988,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2988?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrudolph","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonrudolph","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrudolph/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrudolph/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrudolph/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrudolph/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrudolph/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrudolph/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrudolph/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrudolph/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonrudolph/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-08-31T13:37:09Z","updated_at":"2014-07-02T07:56:50Z","closed_at":"2013-08-31T20:13:09Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/780","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/780","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/780.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/780.patch"},"body":"As discussed in [atom/to-the-hubs#1](https://github.com/atom/to-the-hubs/pull/1#discussion_r5995319), it's useful to have `Git` provide a delegator for `#getUpstreamBranch`, in addition to the other delegators that it provides.\n\nNote: Based on the [numerous other delegators](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/34f16c58e80678d65b9ba19bb35f556bdcfaffa6/src/git.coffee#L214-L224) in this class, it looks like we've chosen not to add [specs](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/34f16c58e80678d65b9ba19bb35f556bdcfaffa6/spec/git-spec.coffee) for simple delegators.

It is done before the config is loaded and before the theme directories are added to the LESS import path.\n\nLoading like this keeps the base css separated from the themes, but it doesn't allow for usage of  variables from `ui-variables` in the base css. If variables were used, they would come from `/static/ui-variables.less` rather than the theme. So if the base `ui-variables` specified a `@component-padding` to be 10px, and my theme wants it to be 20px, I would need to override everywhere the padding is used in my theme with css rules. If the base css could import from the theme dir, my theme could just set the `@component-padding` variable to 20px.\n\nI propose we place the theme directories on the LESS import path when the base css is loaded. Here are the 2 secnarios\n### Loading base css with access to themes\n\nHere’s what would need to happen\n- `config.load()` needs to happen in `window.setUpEnvironment` (Will this slow things down?)\n- `ThemeManager` needs to get the generate the theme directories based on the `core.themes` config option, rather than the loaded themes.\n- Need to rebuild all the css when themes are changed\n\n**Pros**\n- Many things can be pulled into the base css. Most of the button styles, list styles (tree views, etc), text styles, some mixins. The themes do a lot less. There will be less repetition between themes.\n- We can override bootstrap variables in the themes, requiring less css overall. \n\n**Cons**\n- When a theme is changed, we would need to recompile _all_ the css, not just the theme and package css. The bootstrap and the base css as well. Probably not fast.\n- Others I’m missing?\n### Leaving it the way it is\n\n**Pros**\n- Changing themes is only medium slow.\n\n**Cons**\n- Much more repetition between the themes. The new light and dark themes will have a lot of code duplicated between the two.\n- A little awkward because there is this `/static/ui-variables` file and nothing in `static` uses any of the variables from it.\n\nHow do you guys feel about this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/775/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/774","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/774/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/774/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/774/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/774","id":18800974,"number":774,"title":"Don't trim me, bro!","user":{"login":"briandoll","id":4590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/briandoll","html_url":"https://github.com/briandoll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briandoll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briandoll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briandoll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briandoll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briandoll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briandoll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briandoll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briandoll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briandoll/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2013-08-30T17:48:11Z","updated_at":"2013-08-31T17:56:13Z","closed_at":"2013-08-30T22:22:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Type a sentence.
