The behavior was not compatible with Sublime Text, too, which handles the scenario like this:\n- Selecting above or below works with what's visible on screen (thus, no mismatch between buffer length and screen length)\n- Soft-wrapped lines are therefore included while selecting\n- When a soft-wrapped line has indentation, skip it and select the first real character\n\nThis is the behavior I would expect in Atom as well and, hopefully, this PR includes everything that's needed to achieve it :fire: \n\nAn additional pair of :eyes: is most welcome, but even if code-wise this looks good, I'd prefer to leave this open for a while so that the community has the chance to test-drive it.\n\nThank you! :bow: \n\n/cc: @benogle @izuzak @nathansobo @kevinsawicki

of all, thanks to all developers; really enjoying Atom—especially now that soft wrap indent has been implemented!\n\nI noticed that when I create a new window and drag an existing tab over to it the file path of the document displays in the status bar, whereas it usually displays in the title bar.  This becomes an issue when the window is narrow and a long path overlaps with the word count and other info in the status bar resulting in an unreadable mess.  This discrepancy is also reflected in the Window menu.  Furthermore, it would great to have the option to open a new or existing file in a new window (either in Preferences or with a similar function to split pane), instead of having to drag tabs to do so.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5952","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5952/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5952/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5952/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5952","id":60814227,"number":5952,"title":"Failed
