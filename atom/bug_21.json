haven't proven this is the culprit, but all signs point to the [new editor backend in v1.19.0](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.19.0) (or another \"improvement\" in v1.19.0) getting confused when there are multiple types of line endings in a document and **completely corrupting the file** when you run https://github.com/Glavin001/atom-beautify on it.\r\n\r\nI'm using Atom 1.19.0 ia32 with atom-beautify 0.30.4 on Windows 10 Pro 64-bit.\r\n\r\nI'm attaching a zipped file that contains mixed LF and CRLF file. (Yes, it's horrible, but it's out of my control; see the end of this message for the back story.)\r\n\r\nEarlier editions of Atom would should the LF line endings using a different symbol, but _this version of Atom shows the LF line endings as if they were CRLF endings_ when I turn on invisibles. (The line ending notification at the bottom also says CRLF when the type is really mixed.) This is what tips me off that there is an underlying problem in the buffers, thinking that all the line endings are the same --- and when I went and saw the release notes that Atom updated it buffer implementation, that made it almost certain.\r\n\r\nInstall the `atom-beautify` package and open the attached archive. (Don't copy and paste, or that will normalize the line endings.) Make sure the `.jsbeatifyrc` file is in the same directory. Then run `atom-beautify` on it. It will turn this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n    <figure> <figcaption>Examples of local time classes.</figcaption>\r\n      <pre class=\"line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-java\">//someone's date of birth: May 30, 1970\r\nfinal LocalDate dateOfBirth = LocalDate.of(1980, Month.MAY, 30);\r\n//someone's birthday: May 30\r\nfinal MonthDay birthday = MonthDay.of(Month.MAY, 30);\r\n\r\n//a typical end of a workday: 5:00 p.m.\r\nfinal LocalTime endOfWorkday = LocalTime.of(17, 0);\r\n\r\n//current date and time\r\nfinal LocalDateTime = LocalDateTime.now();</code></pre>\r\n    </figure>\r\n```\r\n\r\ninto this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\t<figcaption>Examples of local time classes.</figcaption>\r\n\t\t<pre class=\"line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-java\">//someone's date of birth: May 30, 1970\r\n    <p>Local dates and times are relative or <q>floating</q>; they do not provide sufficient information to determine precisely when an event occurred or will occur. Recording the date and time of a birth, for instance, must include the time zone. A journal entry as well would normally indicate the time zone in order to fix the exact moment in an absolute way worldwide: <q>December 11, 2016 10:53 a.m. America/Los Angeles</q>.</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYes, basically it just jumps around, drops large sections of content, and copies other pieces of content to other locations.\r\n\r\nIf I first take the HTML file into another editor (e.g. EmEditor) and normalize the line endings (either all CRLF or all LF), the bug does not occur and `atom-beautify` functions as it usually does. This proves the bug has to do with mixed line endings, and everything about it points to new overhaul in a recent version of Atom.\r\n\r\n**This is a huge, breaking, content corrupting bug.**\r\n\r\nYes, I have mixed line endings. No, I didn't want them to begin with. One of the reasons I'm opening them in Atom _is so that `atom-beautify` can normalize them_!!! **No editor should corrupt my content just because my EOLs are not consistent.**\r\n\r\nNo matter what I do, my toolchain just keeps developing bugs:\r\n\r\n* The BlueGriffon HTML editor has a huge [bug](https://github.com/therealglazou/bluegriffon/issues/7) from deep in the Mozilla code, which adds newlines when it shouldn't --- but to make matters worse, it adds an LF in the middle of a file using CRLF on a Windows machine, producing mixed line endings. I have put my money out as a [bounty](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/29803090-line-wrapping-setting-ignored) to get this fixed, but there have been no takers.\r\n* I use `atom-beautify` to attempt to reformat the file: to normalize the line endings, and get rid of the extra newlines. This only halfway works; many of the erroneous newlines remain because of a `js-beautify` [bug](https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify/issues/1033). I have also paid my money on a [bounty](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/41908855-not-correctly-joining-lines-for-html) to get this fixed, but no one seems interested.\r\n* Now it would appear that Atom not only can't process EOLs correctly, it also corrupts the files.

Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.\r\n* All new code requires tests to ensure against regressions\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nA very simple one-liner.  The `m` flag wasn't being added when doing a regex replacement on files not opened in Atom.  For those who aren't aware, `m` changes the meaning of `^` and `$` to mean \"begin/end of line\", rather than \"begin/end of string\" (which can be generalized to \"begin/end of file\" in Atom's case).  The behavior that `m` introduces is consistent with what most developers view `^` and `$` as, and is also what find-and-replace visually shows in the results view.  Therefore, this change fixes the discrepancy between the visual, expected result and the actual result when the regex contains a `^` or `$` and the matched string is not the first/last line in the file.\r\n\r\ntext-buffer already adds the `m` flag when replacing files inside of Atom.\r\nhttps://github.com/atom/text-buffer/blob/bb9134fc93713273dcccafd9e917e00f1f2f58cc/src/text-buffer.coffee#L1326\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\n`atom.workspace.replace()` is a public API.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nWhen searching with a regex that contains a `^` or `$`, replacements should now work as expected.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nThere is one drawback: there is no way to return to the non-multiline behavior of `^` and `$` once the flag is set.  JavaScript does not yet support `\\A` and `\\Z`.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nRefs atom/find-and-replace#622","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15224/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15223","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15223/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15223/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15223/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15223","id":249185581,"number":15223,"title":"Editor crashes while editing files on network drive","user":{"login":"zwheaton","id":1137104,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1137104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwheaton","html_url":"https://github.com/zwheaton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwheaton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwheaton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwheaton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwheaton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwheaton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwheaton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwheaton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwheaton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwheaton/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":153145129,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/crash","name":"crash","color":"e11d21","default":false},{"id":192100748,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/network","name":"network","color":"f7c6c7","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"maxbrunsfeld","id":326587,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/326587?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld","html_url":"https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"assignees":[{"login":"maxbrunsfeld","id":326587,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/326587?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld","html_url":"https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-08-09T22:55:43Z","updated_at":"2017-08-24T16:24:45Z","closed_at":"2017-08-24T16:24:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

Nothing is showing up in the developer tools. I've tried both mounting the drive in windows and directly accesing them via the file browser (`\\\\mymacbook\\dev\\projectfolder`)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open a file from a network/remote drive\r\n2. Run a command  on the files (e.g. `npm install`, `bundle exec`) and the editor will crash\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Editor doesn't crash while editing remote files\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Atom crashes and I have to fully reload the program\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nYou can get this information from copy and pasting the output of `atom --version` and `apm --version` from the command line.

Backslashes are required to separate directories.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open Find in Project panel.\r\n2. In the File/directory pattern field, enter a path with forward slashes. For instance, `src/foo/bar`.\r\n3. Search for text that is known to exist in the specified directory. No results are found.\r\n4. Change the path to use backslashes. For instance, `src\\foo\\bar`. Now, results are found.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** File/directory pattern should return the same results, regardless of whether file/directory pattern contains forward slashes or backslashes. This matches the behavior of the vast majority of Windows apps.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** When file/directory pattern contains forward slashes, search returns no results.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Every time.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.19.0\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\n\r\nOS: Windows 10 x64\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n\\-\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15218","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15218/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15218/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15218/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15218","id":249120597,"number":15218,"title":"Debug missing snapshot auxiliary data","user":{"login":"smashwilson","id":17565,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/17565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashwilson","html_url":"https://github.com/smashwilson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashwilson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashwilson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashwilson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashwilson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashwilson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashwilson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashwilson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashwilson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashwilson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-08-09T18:28:53Z","updated_at":"2017-08-10T16:06:22Z","closed_at":"2017-08-10T16:06:19Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/15218","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15218","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15218.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15218.patch"},"body":"Let's do some in-CI debugging to see where our snapshot auxiliary data (notable, the Less compile cache) is getting dropped.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15217","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15217/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15217/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15217/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15217","id":249092301,"number":15217,"title":"Weird when editing text which is partial selected.

run Atom inside a VirtualBox (5.1.24) Linux Mint 18.2 MATE guest (on a Win7 host). Any released version of Atom higher than 1.16, including the recently released 1.19, consumes such a huge amount of memory upon startup, that it effectively halts/OOMs my VM.\r\nWatching memory consumption upon startup, in 1.16 it consumes about 1GB total before settling back down to 400-500MB. But above 1.16, it consumes around 2.4GB while starting up - or more likely that is simply all that is available in my VM.\r\nSomething changed in 1.17 to gobble up all that memory. Amazing if nobody else is having an issue with this. I have tried disabling all plugins, no diff.\r\nI'm obviously stuck on 1.16 until this is resolved.\r\nThanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15211","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15211/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15211/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15211/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15211","id":249057854,"number":15211,"title":"Half of the workspace is unusable","user":{"login":"Saul-BT","id":25767185,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25767185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saul-BT","html_url":"https://github.com/Saul-BT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saul-BT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saul-BT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saul-BT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saul-BT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saul-BT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saul-BT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saul-BT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saul-BT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saul-BT/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-08-09T14:51:51Z","updated_at":"2017-09-07T09:17:55Z","closed_at":"2017-08-09T18:36:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?
