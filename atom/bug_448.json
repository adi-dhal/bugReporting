When I went to select some text in the top pane the chrome developer console popped up. There was no error in the console, so I figured I must have triggered a shortcut. I closed the console and tried to select again. It wouldn't let me select or type or move the curser, but the curser was still flashing. I mashed the keyboard in an attempt to see changes on the screen. When nothing worked, I closed the file and it prompted me to save my changes. Figuring it just got stuck on a keyboard shortcut or mouse gesture, I said save and then reloaded Atom. On reload I opened my file and it was just 8 characters, which I'm pretty sure were the keys I mashed after the window was unresponsive ('asdfasdf').\n\nThe only indication that Atom had issues was the developer console popping up. But there was no error in the console so no indication that anything was actually wrong. If there were some kind of error message or warning I would never have saved my work. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2333/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2332","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2332/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2332/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2332/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2332","id":33970876,"number":2332,"title":"Word wrap and bracket highlight","user":{"login":"gim-","id":1240012,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1240012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gim-","html_url":"https://github.com/gim-","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gim-/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gim-/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gim-/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gim-/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gim-/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gim-/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gim-/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gim-/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gim-/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":84710475,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/editor-rendering","name":"editor-rendering","color":"fef2c0","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"kevinsawicki","id":671378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/671378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinsawicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"assignees":[{"login":"kevinsawicki","id":671378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/671378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinsawicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-05-21T10:40:54Z","updated_at":"2014-05-21T16:28:29Z","closed_at":"2014-05-21T16:28:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Minor bracket highlight issue:\n![snapshot24](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1240012/3038804/cf5bbb08-e0d2-11e3-829b-8dfc39de1f42.png)\n\n\"Some random text here Some random text here {\" is on the same line.

The PR comes from my account a few weeks ago, but the fork actually lives at https://github.com/atom/react/tree/selection-restoration-opt-out. It includes changes to `package.json` so it could be published that we wouldn't want to merge into React.\n\nI'm not sure if this is the best approach structure-wise. The helper library `reactionary` depends on the requiring library having `react` available in its `node_modules`.

Note the larger amount of yellow JS time in the first timeline.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2325/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2324","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2324/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2324/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2324/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2324","id":33934237,"number":2324,"title":"Build windows","user":{"login":"nicolascrop","id":1449136,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1449136?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolascrop","html_url":"https://github.com/nicolascrop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolascrop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolascrop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolascrop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolascrop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolascrop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolascrop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolascrop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolascrop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolascrop/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98407029,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/build-error","name":"build-error","color":"f7c6c7","default":false},{"id":62363277,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2014-05-20T22:01:06Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T12:14:55Z","closed_at":"2014-05-22T08:19:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, \n\nI have a problem during atom building, on windows, i followed the instructions but i got this error:\nnpm WARN `git config --get remote.origin.url` returned wrong result (git://githu\nb.com/atom/grunt-coffeelint.git)\nnpm ERR! git clone git://github.com/atom/grunt-coffeelint.git Cloning into bare\nrepository 'C:\\Users\\Nico.atom.npm_git-remotes\\git-github-com-atom-grunt-coff\neelint-git-ae5f2712'...\nnpm ERR! git clone git://github.com/atom/grunt-coffeelint.git\nnpm ERR! git clone git://github.com/atom/grunt-coffeelint.git fatal: write error\n: Invalid argument\nnpm ERR!

Since you are using React.js, I'm running into the following issue:\n\nBefore React, I was able to focus autocomplete-plus's hidden input field every time an autocompletion was triggered. Since all keyboard events bubbled up to the editor view (except for the ones defined in the keymap), I was able to receive keymap events and keep typing inside the editor at the same time.\n\nSince you are using React, this is not possible anymore. It seems like autocomplete-plus's hidden input field is swallowing all keyboard events and the EditorView entirely loses focus. If I disable the React editor, it works fine.\n\nCan you think of a reason for this?\n\nI've been talking to @kevinsawicki about this before and he asked me to move the conversation to the GitHub issues :)\n\nBest,\nSascha\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2317","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2317/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2317/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2317/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2317","id":33919395,"number":2317,"title":"Add
