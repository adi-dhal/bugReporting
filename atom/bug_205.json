using key bindings to trigger pane:close-other-items and there exist unsaved pane items, a `„` character is dropped on the cursors position once you close the save dialog box.\n\n**Reproduction Steps:**\n1. Open a saved file\n2. Open a new file and throw some text in it\n3. Go back to the first file\n4. Use keybindings to close other tabs (`cmd-k alt-cmd-w` on darwin [by default](https://github.com/atom/atom/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=close-other-items))\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n\nAll other tabs close and I carry on with my day\n\n**Observed behavior:**\n\nAll other tabs close and a `„` character appears where my cursor is in the active tab\n\n**Screenshots and GIFs**\n\n![gif](http://i.imgur.com/MjODFOL.gif)\n\n**Atom version:** 1.2.0\n**OS and version:** OS X Yosemite 10.10.5\n\n**Installed packages:**\n\nDon't think any I have installed are relevant to the issue.\n\n**Additional information:**\n- Problem can be reproduced in safe mode: Yes\n- Problem started happening recently, didn't happen in an older version of Atom: No\n- Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: Yes\n- Problem happens with all files and projects, not only some files or projects: Yes\n- **Problem does not happen if you use the command palette instead of the key binding.**\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9661/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9660","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9660/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9660/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9660/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9660","id":117460073,"number":9660,"title":"package

When having an other amount of alignment spaces, Atom will always interpret soft tabs in alignment with the `tabLength` I'm using (e.g. 9 spaces will result, in this case, to 2 soft tabs + 1 space).\n\nNow, after pressing enter after the first line I aligned with spaces (and is hard-tabbed indented), I'd expect the editor to start/indent + align the next line the same way (e.g. Sublime Text does this well). Atom however transforms every _tabLength_ amount of spaces to a hard tab.\n\nRelated to this it would be cool/nifty if a tab pressed inside/before/after alignment spaces would actually insert spaces instead of a hard tab (also because I can't imagine in what situation such would be desirable - so it helps in preventing the unintentional..)\n\nCheers! :hibiscus:\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9652/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9651","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9651/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9651/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9651/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9651","id":117369271,"number":9651,"title":"Tab line rendering seems odd","user":{"login":"mcnesium","id":476060,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/476060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcnesium","html_url":"https://github.com/mcnesium","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcnesium/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcnesium/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcnesium/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcnesium/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcnesium/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcnesium/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcnesium/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcnesium/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcnesium/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-11-17T14:47:47Z","updated_at":"2015-11-17T17:34:24Z","closed_at":"2015-11-17T17:34:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"![bildschirmfoto 2015-11-17 um 15 42 02](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/476060/11214506/f154b670-8d41-11e5-9d1f-fe076c7906cd.png)\n\nThe tab lines seem not to be in equal distance of each other.

Then I tried to get that string by calling editor.getTextInBufferRange(range). It works as expected and I get entire string if line is indented with spaces.\n\nIf line is indented with tabs, returned string starts several characters to the right, it is the right length (or cropped if there are no more characters). bufferRangeForScopeAtCursor seems to be counting single tab as multiple characters (based on its width), while getTextInBufferRange counts tab as only one character.\n\nFor example, if line starts with 2 tabs (4 chars wide) immediately followed by string, start column of range returned from bufferRangeForScopeAtCursor is 8 (or undefined, see below). Since getTextInBufferRange counts tab as one character, it returns string starting with eighth character which is already 6 letters inside of string I was trying to get.\n\nLet's assume this code:\n\n```\nrange = editor.bufferRangeForScopeAtCursor(\".string\")\neditor.getTextInBufferRange(range)\n```\n\nand this input:\n\n```\n\\t\\t\"my string\", some other text\n```\n\nIf cursor is placed before \"r\", bufferRangeForScopeAtCursor returns undefined. That is because editor.getCursorBufferPosition (used internally by bufferRangeForScopeAtCursor) counts tab as one character and therefore it returns column < 8, which as far as bufferRangeForScopeAtPosition (also used internally by bufferRangeForScopeAtCursor) is concerned is not within any string.\n\nIf cursor is placed after \"r\", it returns \"ring\", some\".\n\nWhen you look at tokenizedLines in TokenizedBuffer for that line, you see that tags start [4,4,...] (4 may be replaced by actual tab width) and as far as I can currently tell this seems to be the problem. I assume that either tokenizer should not count tabs as multiple characters or bufferRangeForScopeAtPosition should not take tags as buffer column numbers.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9647","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9647/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9647/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9647/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9647","id":117326037,"number":9647,"title":"Binary packages for 1.2.1 release are REALLY missing - with screenshot","user":{"login":"alanfranz","id":230827,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/230827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanfranz","html_url":"https://github.com/alanfranz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanfranz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanfranz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanfranz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanfranz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanfranz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanfranz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanfranz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanfranz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanfranz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":175213356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/question","name":"question","color":"ededed","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2015-11-17T10:32:38Z","updated_at":"2015-11-17T17:35:07Z","closed_at":"2015-11-17T14:09:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello,\nI'm re-opening a ticket since #9645 was closed before I could answer.\nI don't know what happened, but I can confirm there're no downloadable packages for 1.2.1.

provided a way to get raw stacktrace in [error.getRawStack](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/6e8184658090b223e9eadcdef4bd39479a30e004/src/compile-cache.js#L171) and tries to prevent further

following:\n\n```\nconst error = new Error();\nerror.stack;\nerror.getRawStack();\n> \"Error\n    at <anonymous>:2:15\n    at Object.InjectedScript._evaluateOn (<anonymous>:904:140)\n    at Object.InjectedScript._evaluateAndWrap (<anonymous>:837:34)\n    at Object.InjectedScript.evaluate (<anonymous>:693:21)\"\n```\n\nWhereas Nuclide need this structured stack information to categorize/track errors by [customizing Error.prepareStackTrace](https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/blob/master/pkg/nuclide/logging/lib/stacktrace.js#L30), which had caused problems describe [here](https://github.com/atom/grim/commit/8807010397e64f499b6815090d7b575aaf4a27c3#diff-dd248f5f751e9429ed611987b50f19b6R48), and https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/246 .\n\nFor now, I could manually set `Error.prototype.getRawStack = null;` in our customization so that atom/grim will fallback to it's another implementation of [getRawStack](https://github.com/atom/grim/blob/master/src/grim.coffee#L80). \nBut we need to fix the bug of error.getRawStack() so that Nuclide don't need to customize the stacktraces.\n\ncc
