entry areas on OS X implement a few readline/emacs keystrokes, including ctrl-k for \"kill to end of line\" and ctrl-y for \"yank from kill buffer\". I use them both a lot and in particular, this is the behavior I expect:\n- Cutting a line with ctrl-k goes into the undo manager, but not into the system pasteboard:\n- Text cut with ctrl-k can be pasted with ctrl-y to any other window in the same application, but the ctrl-k buffer is per-application\n\nIn other words, you can't command-v something you've cut with ctrl-k, and the ctrl-k kill buffer is application-wide.\n\nRight now ctrl-k is bound to `editor:cut-to-end-of-line` in the emacs keymapping, but it affects the global pasteboard and there's no ctrl-y counterpart. \n\nIt might be worth adding a ctrl-y mapping and changing ctrl-k/ctrl-y behavior to make Atom seem more native on Mac.
