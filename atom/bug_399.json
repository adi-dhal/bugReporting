you for developing and maintaining Atom!\n\nI'm using it on GNU/Linux Ubuntu and it seems the launcher (`.desktop` file) has a capital letter in its name. It should be renamed to `atom.desktop` because a `.desktop` file should not contain capital letters as any other `.desktop` files that we can find in `/usr/share/applications`.\n\nNote that we also have another problem because currently, the window's class of all Atom windows is `Atom Shell` but the launcher is named `Atom`. We should also add this line in your `.desktop` file:\n\n```\nStartupWMClass=Atom Shell\n```\n\nBecause without that, it's not possible for a dock/panel (like Cairo-Dock) to link a launcher (`Atom`) with its window (`Atom Shell`).\n\nBut it's certainly better to rename the window's class and this is why I just created this pull request in the `atom-shell` project! => https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/pull/698\n\nBest Regards,\n\nMatt\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3803/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3802","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3802/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3802/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3802/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3802","id":45580577,"number":3802,"title":"yaml

When I browse most pages, like apple.com, atom.io, etc., the iFrame webpage browsing works. But when I go to some pages like gmail.com or github.com the page loads and then one second later the entire desktop window crashes (disappears) with no errors shown.\n\nI built a quick atom-shell test app and loaded http://github.com in an iFrame with identical attributes and it worked.  I could browse github pages with no problem.\n\nSo either the Atom editor isn't using the same atom-shell version or there is something about the editor environment creating the problem.\n\nI'm on windows 8.0.  My Atom editor is 0.136.0.  I did the atom-shell test in atom-shell 0.17.2.\n\nAny ideas?  I'd be happy to expand my test app or do anything else I can to help find this.
