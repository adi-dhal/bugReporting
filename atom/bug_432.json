this PR super early. I want to layout what I am thinking before getting into it. \n### Editor / DisplayBuffer\n\nThe API is designed to be consistent with the marker API. The marker API has a `markBufferRange` function that returns a `Marker` object. Removal of the marker is done through a `destroy` method. The Decorations API takes on the same form:\n- `(Decoration) decorateMarker(marker, decorationParams)`\n\nThese remain unchanged:\n- `(Decoration) decorationForId(decorationId)`\n- `(Object) decorationsForScreenRowRange(startScreenRow, endScreenRow)`\n### Decoration\n\nNew:\n- `(void) destroy()` - this just calls `displayBuffer::removeDecoration(this)`\n- `(void) update(newParams)` - update the params with newParams. Lets the `displayBuffer` know there was an update, which will notify the `EditorComponent`.\n\nUnchanged:\n- `flash`\n### TODO\n- [x] `Decoration::destroy()` \n- [x] `Decoration::update()` \n- [x] `DisplayBuffer / Editor::decorateMarker()` \n- [x] Update packages using decorations\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2818","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2818/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2818/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2818/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2818","id":37129981,"number":2818,"title":"Concept of multiple projects alive (but not active)","user":{"login":"mehcode","id":753919,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/753919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode","html_url":"https://github.com/mehcode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-07-03T22:40:08Z","updated_at":"2015-03-07T07:20:27Z","closed_at":"2014-11-11T01:25:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"``` coffee\n# Empty workspace\natom.projects.push {\"name\": \"x\", \"path\": \"....\"}\natom.projects.activate \"x\"\n\n# project \"x\" is now active in the tree view \n# and its \"state\" (open documents, etc.) is being stored\n\natom.projects.push {\"name\": \"y\", \"path\": \"....\"}\natom.projects.activate \"y\"\n\n# project \"y\" is now active in the tree view but the \n# state of \"x\" was not lost\n\natom.projects.activate \"x\"\n\n# switch back to project \"x\" exactly as you've left it\n```\n\nSomething like that (of course the API could be something else).

of now, installing atom on windows involves cloning the repo and building it from source. This assumes you already have git because the build system uses git to download other parts of the program.\n\nAs atom gets an official windows build, however, git may or may not be installed on users machines. A user may also choose between github's Git for Desktop or msysgit. There should be 4 operating modes for atom based on these cases.\n1. Integrate with github's Git for Desktop.\n2. Detect the user's msysgit installation WITHOUT using the PATH environment variable. First check the default installation location, and if it's not there, prompt the user to supply a path where it's installed. Call the binaries directly from that path.\n3. Operate with an embedded version of git. This can be accomplished in the same way atlassian's SourceTree works: Download a portable release of msysgit, and use the binaries from that.\n4. Operate without git integration and not complain.\n\nThe user should have the option to choose any of the 4 modes in the the settings dialog, and by default, atom should attempt to use them in that order.\n\nThis suggestion is mostly based on the windows version of atom, but could apply equally across all platforms with minor modifications.
