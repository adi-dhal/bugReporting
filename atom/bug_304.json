When you stretch a selection past the edge of the scroll region, the editor scrolls to accommodate you, but once you overshoot your destination, pulling back starts scrolling back in the other direction even though it's not necessary.  Most other editors will only scroll when necessary.\n\nSteps:\n1. open a file that is at least twice as long as what you can display in your window\n2. make sure you're scrolled to the top\n3. triple-click and hold somewhere to begin selecting entire lines\n4. drag down just past the bottom of the window, causing the window to scroll\n5. once you've scrolled all the way to the bottom (it's important here that you scroll at least past the point where the top of the selection scrolls out of the window), pretend you overshot the bottom of what you wanted selected by a few lines and you actually want the selection to end at the 10th line from the bottom of the file.  continue to hold the mouse button down while you move your mouse back up to that line.\n6. observe that if you move your mouse up past about the 4th line from the bottom of the window, it actually starts scrolling back up and will keep going until the top of your selection is visible.  This makes it difficult to get the selection to stop on a specific line because you have to time the scrolling to get your target line within 4 lines of the bottom of the window.\n\nExpected: after mouse movement downward causes a scroll, moving the mouse back up into the window should not cause scrolling back in the other direction unless you attempt to move the end of the selection past the top of the visible part of the file.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6675/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6674","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6674/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6674/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6674/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6674","id":73764977,"number":6674,"title":"Atom crashes opening directory","user":{"login":"jfsiii","id":57655,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/57655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfsiii","html_url":"https://github.com/jfsiii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfsiii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfsiii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfsiii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfsiii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfsiii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfsiii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfsiii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfsiii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfsiii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":153145129,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/crash","name":"crash","color":"e11d21","default":false},{"id":98445015,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/mac","name":"mac","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":37,"created_at":"2015-05-06T23:11:35Z","updated_at":"2016-04-09T23:56:50Z","closed_at":"2016-04-09T23:56:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## Steps to reproduce:\n1.

tried searching for a similar issue here and I didn't find anything that directly addresses what I want, though #3249 (which I have subscribed to) is what I want, just asked for in a very roundabout way.\n\nIn short: we should have an option to only display invisibles within a selection. Showing them all the time is too noisy, not showing them at all loses their power, and turning them off and on when I want to see them is annoying. I'm aware that with CSS we cannot achieve what is required (hence unresolved #3249, and accompanying [forum post](https://discuss.atom.io/t/atom-is-so-powerful-that-it-blows-my-mind/294/17?)) due to the underlayer controlling the background highlight. So this will presumably be something that atom must provide from within the core.\n\nIf this request appeals more as something that's more generic (and allow us to achieve what we want with CSS) you could actually just attach a `.selected` class to all elements (scopes) that are within the selection (obviously a selection part-way through an element will require an inner span injected with just the `.selected` class). This way, we can do what we want in regards to the invisibles, but package developers may find interesting ways to use this selection class/scope for other purposes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6669/reactions","total_count":94,"+1":94,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6668","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6668/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6668/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6668/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6668","id":73556188,"number":6668,"title":"Uncaught

upgrading atom I've had to remove certain modules it seems because of binary incompatibility. Which is all fine. But I use gulp-watch which isn't used in my packages run-time, just for a development workflow. What am I doing wrong? Or is this expected? It seems not being able to use any tool you want during development is a major limitation.\n\n![screen shot 2015-05-05 at 6 08 04
