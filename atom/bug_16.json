By this I mean: I use `cmd-.` to invoke the keybinding resolver.  I hit some keyboard combination, say ctrl-1.  When I press ctrl, the keybindig resolver shows me \"ctrl\".  When I then hit the 1 key, the display changes from just \"ctrl\" to \"ctrl-1\", and underneath the key name, it shows me which command would be executed.\r\n\r\nBut when I hit ctrl-6, ctrl-7, ctrl-8 or ctrl-9, the keybinding resolver shows me just \"ctrl\" and never shows me the additional digit.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Start Atom\r\n2. Invoke keybinding resolver with `cmd-.`\r\n3. Press and then release the `ctrl` key.  Remember what the keybinding resolver shows.\r\n4. Press `ctrl-5`.  Remember what the keybinding resolver shows.\r\n5. Press `ctrl-9`.  Remember what the keybinding resolver shows.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** What the keybinding resolver shows after steps 3, 4, 5 should be different.  What it shows after step 4 and after step 5 should be somehow similar.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** What the keybinding resolver shows after step 3 and after step 5 is _exactly_ the same.  By this I mean that if you were to take screenshots of the Atom window after these steps, they would be identical, pixel for pixel.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Always.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.19.2\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\napm  1.18.4\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.10\r\ngit 2.14.1\r\n\r\nI'm running macOS Sierra 10.12.6..\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nActually, I wanted to complain that keybindings don't work in the github package, until I found out that it's actually the `ctrl-9` keybinding that doesn't give focus to the git tab.

(The file essentially disappears from the tree in Atom's view.)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```gherkin\r\nGiven I have a Git repository on branch \"master\"\r\nAnd I have branch \"a\" off that commit that creates file \"a.rb\", checked-out\r\nAnd I have opened file \"a.rb\" in Atom\r\n\r\nWhen I issue \"git checkout master\"\r\nThen file \"a.rb\" has an unsaved file flag\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** I would expect this is taken in charge by the UI/UX. An unsaved flag essentially means that I have made changes in Atom that have not been persisted to the filesystem. That is not the case. The flag is thus confusing when working with multiple files and branches and trying to keep track of what is saved and not.\r\n\r\nThe current behavior on a file that changes externally (rather than is \"removed\") is to simply update the file without questions.\r\n\r\nSome possible outcomes could be to:\r\n* Display a prompt notifying the file has been removed and to take an action (Keep open with latest content/Keep open empty content/Close tab) – could be annoying with multiple files\r\n* Close the tab\r\n* Keep the tab open and display an \"absent file\" placeholder\r\n\r\nActually, is there already a behavior defined for files that are removed externally, even without Git in mind?\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Described in Then\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\natom --version\r\nAtom    : 1.19.2\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nmacOS Sierra.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nAny additional information, configuration or data that might be necessary to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\nSearch terms: \"git change unsaved \"\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15378","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15378/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15378/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15378/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15378","id":251254796,"number":15378,"title":"Drop use of GPU tiles for lines and line numbers","user":{"login":"as-cii","id":482957,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/482957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii","html_url":"https://github.com/as-cii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-08-18T14:02:11Z","updated_at":"2017-08-31T18:33:53Z","closed_at":"2017-08-21T08:44:59Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/15378","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15378","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15378.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15378.patch"},"body":"Fixes #15171\r\n\r\nAt the cost of a very minimal reduction in layout performance, we gain reliable rendering at all line heights and don't have to worry about characters that extend above/below the footprint of a line.\r\n\r\n@ungb @Ben3eeE @50Wliu: this should fix all the reported bugs of cropped text when using certain fonts or line heights.

I will usually copy this into Atom, make the necessary changes, and paste it back. This provides a lot more than just syntax highlighting, such as auto-complete and auto-indent. However, if I restart Atom or my PC, the assigned syntax is lost and I have to re-assign it every time, on all buffers - there's no point in saving the copied HTML to actual files, as I'd have to regularly clean these files from my computer.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open Atom and add a project root\r\n2. Open a new tab and add some content in a defined language, e.g. HTML or Python\r\n3. Assign the correct syntax to the buffer\r\n3. Do not save the content to a file\r\n4. Restart Atom\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Atom re-opens with everything - content, settings, etc - preserved\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Atom re-opens with syntax set to plain text on unsaved buffers\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100% of the time, every time\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n1.17.2 when I first started using Atom, currently on 1.19.2 ia32 and this behaviour has always been consistent.

Things started to go a bit weird. My Windows `System` process (NT kernel & system) started hogging ~30% of my CPU indefinitely, which I had no reason to believe was anything to do with Atom. However, this morning nothing happened when I tried to open Atom. I noticed 1.19.2 had appeared in my `%LOCALAPPDATA%/atom/` folder, but I could only open 1.19.1, and when I did, it opened without any packages/themes enabled. I tried deleting the 1.19.2 folder (which didn't go to completion as something was using one of the files). Then, Norton flagged up `Update.exe` as acting suspiciously. I let it quarantine `Update.exe`, and then my `System` process stopped hogging the CPU (this could be a coincidence, of course). Anyway, I then successfully deleted 1.19.2 folder, and then downloaded the installer from the atom homepage. Now everything's working fine, I'm on 1.19.2. Not sure what happened there, but I thought I'd open an issue in case anyone else suffers the same fate and comes googling.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15368","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15368/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15368/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15368/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15368","id":250961483,"number":15368,"title":"Add windows-build-tools to windows build instructions","user":{"login":"ericcornelissen","id":3742559,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3742559?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericcornelissen","html_url":"https://github.com/ericcornelissen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericcornelissen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericcornelissen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericcornelissen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericcornelissen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericcornelissen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericcornelissen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericcornelissen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericcornelissen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericcornelissen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":104428530,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":62363277,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-08-17T14:23:00Z","updated_at":"2017-08-17T18:11:34Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\r\n\r\nI would like to suggest adding [this package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/windows-build-tools) as an option for Visual C++ build tools to the build documentation for Windows (`docs/build-instructions/windows.md`).
