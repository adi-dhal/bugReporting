Right now, panes, tabs, and other functionality is very hard-coded to the editor use case. But what about opening an image viewer / editor or a markdown preview? Or something else? Our current arrangement falls down.\n\nNow, panes are a much more central part of the view system. Panes have multiple items, and pane items can either be regular views _or_ they can be model objects. When you add a model object as a pane item, that object needs a `getViewClass` method to instruct the pane on how it should be rendered.\n\nSo now, instead of editors managing multiple edit sessions, edit sessions will just be added as pane items, and the pane will attach an editor and assign its edit session when it needs to render an edit session item. Any other types of items can follow a similar course.\n\nEverything is ripped apart right now, but that's the goal.\n- [x] Extract a pane container view for dealing with pane layout and other pane-spanning behavior\n- [x] Make pane-splitting general, so that editor / edit session don't need to know about it\n- [x] Rename Pane.currentItem/View to activeItem/View\n- [x] Remove pane-splitting code from editor\n- [x] Remember which pane was last focused (activePane)\n- [x] Handle core:close event on pane\n- [x] Revamp tabs to work with panes / pane items instead of editors / edit sessions\n- [x] Support reordering items\n- [x] Support moving items from one pane to another\n- [x] Remove code for dealing with multiple edit sessions on editor\n- [x] Make fuzzy finder work without reliance on editors having multiple edit sessions\n- [x] Fix fuzzy finder splitting\n- [x] Remove getActiveEditor. Root view should speak in terms of panes / items\n- [x] Replace edit-session-removed events with their pane-item equivalent\n- [x] Set the project path in the model layer when one of its edit sessions is first saved, not in the root view when focus shifts\n- [x] Make tabs indicate when something is modified\n- [x] Prompt when closing modified pane items\n- [x] Handle save / save as on panes instead of editor\n- [x] Handle saveAll on pane container\n- [x] Move autosave to panes\n- [x] Support destroying pane items other than the current\n- [x] Support destroying all pane items and closing the pane\n- [x] Numeric bindings for tab-switching should work\n- [x] eliminate fixturesProject\n- [x] Support reopening of most recently closed pane item\n- [x] Title is not updating when an untitled file is saved for the first time\n- [x] Restore root view serialization specs\n- [x] Version the serialized window state and blow it away or migrate it if it gets stale\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/292","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/292/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/292/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/292/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/292","id":11215521,"number":292,"title":"Insert
