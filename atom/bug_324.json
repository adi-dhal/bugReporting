#6055 \n\nThis is still a work in progress: code is messy and specs are not passing yet. ~~With this PR we basically wrap every character with a span so that we're able to measure it.

The former should calculate anything related to lines, whereas the latter  performs updates which need to be based on lines measurement.\n- [x] Write new specs to consolidate this behavior\n- [x] Make existing specs pass\n- [x] Remove references to scoped char width\n- [x] Scrolling into an unmeasured line with decorations (or cursors) has issues (since we don't measure such lines on scroll anymore and updating them doesn't require any user action)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6083/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6082","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6082/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6082/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6082/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6082","id":64064421,"number":6082,"title":"Warn before quitting","user":{"login":"eddiemonge","id":127535,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/127535?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddiemonge","html_url":"https://github.com/eddiemonge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddiemonge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddiemonge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddiemonge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddiemonge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddiemonge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddiemonge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddiemonge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddiemonge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddiemonge/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true},{"id":97310502,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/help-wanted","name":"help-wanted","color":"159818","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":17,"created_at":"2015-03-24T18:14:11Z","updated_at":"2017-05-25T14:55:05Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"It'd be nice to have an option to warn before quitting when hitting Cmd+Q as its too easy to close all your editors when trying to close a single tab.

There is nothing bad about this idea. But I think, it would be a better way to ask the user to Opt-In this analytics.\n\nCurrently, the user has to disable the metrics plugin (= do an Opt-Out), but I think there should be at least a clear information at the first run to tell the user that data is collected and if he/ she wants to allow the collection of this data. \n\nOtherwise, this situation could cause maybe sooner or later problems in countries with stricter data privacy laws, e. g. Germany.

As you can see, when querying the pixel position for the first column of the first line after the text wrap, the pixel position is still the one of the last char of the line above. This is true for every columns of the hanging indent (see the screenshot below). I guess the issue comes from the handling of the hanging indent, but the result shouldn't be a position at the end of the line above anyway.\n\n![color-marker-element-spec_coffee_-__users_cedric_github_pigments_-_atom](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/247140/6770769/35679794-d0cb-11e4-912b-95831c192dff.png)\n\nBut, it's not the only problem, converting position from the screen to the buffer space coordinates gives also weird result:\n\n![color-marker-element-spec_coffee_-__users_cedric_github_pigments_-_atom](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/247140/6770718/7bc4199e-d0c9-11e4-8741-6554240be401.png)\n\nAs you can see, here the converted buffer range starts one character before what's the editor element displays.\n\nConfig: \n\nAtom Version 0.188.0-f42a62d\nOSX 10.10.3\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6062","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6062/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6062/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6062/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/6062","id":63531119,"number":6062,"title":"Defer keydown event to refresh screen while fast key typing","user":{"login":"ypresto","id":400558,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/400558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ypresto","html_url":"https://github.com/ypresto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ypresto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ypresto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ypresto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ypresto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ypresto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ypresto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ypresto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ypresto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ypresto/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-03-22T13:16:13Z","updated_at":"2015-03-28T12:05:54Z","closed_at":"2015-03-28T12:04:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/6062","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/6062","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/6062.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/6062.patch"},"body":"I feel atom is very laggy while typing fast or key repeat (than vim :) ).\nEspecially lag on repeating j/k caret move is huge, freezes for seconds.\n\nWith time profiler, I found continuous keydown events block main thread for >10sec (!).\n\n![2015-03-22 21 03 57](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/400558/6769259/482ce42c-d0d7-11e4-8915-66825d458791.png)\n\n![2015-03-22 21 05 36](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/400558/6769260/49c7114a-d0d7-11e4-9495-2faeb35e8170.png)\n\nThis happens even if vim-mode is disabled.\n\nIt is significant because I use [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/index.html.en) to make key repeat even faster than maximum speed of OS X preferences.\n\nThis PR increases rendering rate by deferring keydown event handling until next setTimeout dispatch.\nThis enables to refresh screen before handling next key event.\nLag on fast typing in insert mode is reduced too.\n\nLeft: before, right: after!\n\n![atom-key-typing-speed-720p](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/400558/6769489/08a94b06-d0e1-11e4-9918-09a3fcf02103.gif)\n\n(I'm wondering that there is so much idle time after releasing key and before main thread is released.
