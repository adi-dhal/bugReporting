I've noticed that this happens intermittently.\n# How to reproduce the bug\n1. Copy and paste the example text below in a new Atom tab.\n2. Toggle soft-wrap from the View menu (just to make it more easy to see).\n3. Select two random characters that occur more than once in the text (e.g., the \"em\" from \"Lorem ...\").\n4. Press Ctrl-Cmd-G to expand the selection to all other occurences of those two characters in the text.\n5. Notice that the cursor from the original selection (e.g., the \"em\" from \"Lorem ...\") flashed out of sync from the other cursors.\n6. I've noticed that this happens intermittently. If you don't see the out-of-sync flashing on the first time, repeat steps 3 through 5 ten more times. You should see it happen.\n# Video Demo\n\nI might as well include a quick video demo of the bug, in case you can't reproduce it.
