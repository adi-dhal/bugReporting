think it would be a great idea if you included more details in the release notes when you release a new version, as you guys just published 0.141 around 10 hours ago, but the release notes for the release are incredibly basic, and I noticed you guys made a lot of commits for the 0.141 release before you guys actually released it, so you guys might want to make the release notes more detailed,

has a problem in dealing with Devanagari, in that the cursor position does not always reflect the actual position if there is some Devanagari text in the current line. Same goes for selecting within lines containing Devanagari.\n\nI can also see that Atom renders Devangari as fully formed Devangari with half-forms, conjuncts (ligatures), and so on. For an editor I would much prefer the Sublime Text approach, where Devanagari text is treated as a string of characters with no attempt to render half-forms, conjuncts, and do the other advanced OpenType compositing features. Instead the text is rendered the way it is typed, which is much much easier to edit.\n\nHere is some sample text that borks Atom:\n\n```\n<span class=\"Glyphs\">NO LANG ‘रृ’ “रॄ” ल- लृ–!!!???,.</span></span></br>\n```\n\n(Try here to select the ??? and delete them…)\n\n```\n<span class=\"ModelNorthern\">रृ रॄ ल लृ लॄ ऌ ॡ </span></b>\n```\n\n(Try here to select the Devanagari characters and delete them…)\n\nAlso try to paste those strings into Sublime Text and see how ST renders the Devanagari as full-forms + halants/virama + matras in sequential order, which I would prefer.\n\nBecause the monospaced fonts we use often do not have Devanagari, the Devanagari is rendered in a proportional fall-back font. If you did as in Sublime Text you could force the advance-width of all the Devanagari glyphs to be the same as the default monospaced font. That way you could preserve monospaced text and get around the whole – very thorny – issue of mixing in complex non-latin scripts in a monospaced environment.\n\nJust an idea, so up to you to find out if that would actually be a way to go.\n\nI note that you have partially fixed the issue in 0.140, but it’s still not perfect. Take this example line:\n\n```\n<span style=\"word-wrap: break-word\">क ख ग घ ङ च छ ज झ ञ ट ठ ड ढ ण त थ द ध न प फ ब भ म य र ऱ ल ळ व श ष स ह क़ ख़ ग़ ज़ ड़ ढ़ फ़ य़ ॹ ॻ ॼ ॾ ॿ</span><br><br>\n```\n\nIf you try to select it with the mouse, from the end towards the beginning of the line, then the last br> is not selected.\n\nIf you select the Devanagari text and press delete, then you end up with this:\n\n```\n<span style=\"word-wrap: break-word\">pan><br><br>\n```\n\n(notice the missing </s in the closing span tag).\n- **Atom Version:** 0.140.0\n- **OS Version:**   Mac OS X 10.10\n- **Misc Versions**\n  -
