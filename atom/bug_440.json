have been complaining about the mousewheel scroll speed -- it's too fast. It is really really sensitive. Turns out the deltas from the mousewheel event are generally regarded as [too fast](https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-mousewheel/issues/36). \n\nIn my tests, the browser scroll speed is somewhere between 30 and 40% of atom's scroll speed. So I've slowed it down by that much. It feels way better. \n\n[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/DOM_event_reference/mousewheel) says the values are different depending on system and attached mouse. Anyone have an actual windows machine they can test this out on? @kevinsawicki are you using a real windows machine?\n\nIt is an option called `editor.scrollSensitivity`. Not sure what the units should be. I have it as a percentage of the original value, so the default is 40. It depends on what this feels like on windows.\n\nRefs #1906\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2567/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2566","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2566/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2566/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2566/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2566","id":35337800,"number":2566,"title":"Minified error invariant.js","user":{"login":"kevinsawicki","id":671378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/671378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinsawicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-06-10T00:05:25Z","updated_at":"2014-06-10T18:14:04Z","closed_at":"2014-06-10T18:14:04Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"There are ~125k of these in bugsnag.\n\n```\nUncaught Error: Minified exception occured; use the non-minified dev environment for the full error message and additional helpful warnings.\napp/node_modules/react-atom-fork/lib/invariant.js:34:17 invariant\napp/node_modules/react-atom-fork/lib/ReactCompositeComponent.js:1369:9 [object Object].ReactCompositeComponentMixin.forceUpdate\napp/src/editor-component.js:917:21 [object Object].module.exports.React.createClass.requestUpdate\napp/node_modules/react-atom-fork/lib/ReactCompositeComponent.js:1434:21 [object Object].boundMethod [as requestUpdate]\napp/src/editor-component.js:903:19 [object Object].module.exports.React.createClass.onStoppedScrolling\napp/node_modules/react-atom-fork/lib/ReactCompositeComponent.js:1434:21 [object Object].boundMethod [as onStoppedScrolling]\napp/node_modules/underscore-plus/node_modules/underscore/underscore.js:724:25 later\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2566/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2564","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2564/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2564/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2564/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2564","id":35309326,"number":2564,"title":"Reloading spec window with inspector open pauses","user":{"login":"benogle","id":69169,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/69169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle","html_url":"https://github.com/benogle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2014-06-09T18:17:36Z","updated_at":"2014-08-15T05:28:12Z","closed_at":"2014-08-15T05:28:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"1.

Still the same issue.\nI suppose that points at something outside of Atom being wrong.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2551","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2551/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2551/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2551/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2551","id":35220478,"number":2551,"title":"Treeview toggle not working when first opened","user":{"login":"batjko","id":7287076,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7287076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/batjko","html_url":"https://github.com/batjko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/batjko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/batjko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/batjko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/batjko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/batjko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/batjko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/batjko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/batjko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/batjko/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":17,"created_at":"2014-06-07T22:23:12Z","updated_at":"2017-04-27T16:34:13Z","closed_at":"2014-06-09T18:08:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Windows 8.1\n\nEvery time I open atom (without passing any location or file to open), it opens up with an empty editor pane as expected. \n\nBut when I press Ctrl-\\ the tree view does not open.\nIf I go to \"Toggle Tree View\" from the menu, it also does nothing, no matter how often I click it or hit the key binding.\n\nOnly after opening a new window, e.g. by opening a folder or file via the menu, does the toggling work again and the tree view responds.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2551/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2550","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2550/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2550/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2550/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2550","id":35218597,"number":2550,"title":"beginning/end of word keybinding doesn't handle camelCase","user":{"login":"saheljalal","id":1617586,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1617586?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saheljalal","html_url":"https://github.com/saheljalal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saheljalal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saheljalal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saheljalal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saheljalal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saheljalal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saheljalal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saheljalal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saheljalal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saheljalal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-06-07T21:10:35Z","updated_at":"2014-06-07T21:44:28Z","closed_at":"2014-06-07T21:44:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I used Sublime before and I remember being able to shift between words and in between words if there wereAnyCamelCase it would stop at each word.
