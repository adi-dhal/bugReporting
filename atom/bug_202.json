introduced the \"Close Empty Windows\" option, which is described as \"When a window with no tabs or panes is given the 'Close Tab' command, close that window.\" in Settings.\n\n![screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/159434/11303872/94600abc-8fa5-11e5-9412-62734caa656a.png)\n\n@izuzak points out (https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/863#issuecomment-158914212) that this works for \"File\" -> \"Close Tab\", the Command-W/Control-W shortcuts and the \"Core: Close\" command in the command palette, but _not_ for the \"Tabs: Close Tab\" command.\n\nThe reason is that \"Tabs: Close Tab\" is not defined as `core:close`, but as the `tabs:close-tab` command defined by the `tabs` package which is unaffected by this recent change to `core:close` behavior.\n\nWe could:\n- Change the description of the new setting to make this distinction.\n- Change the behavior of `tabs:close-tab` to match that of `core:close`.\n\nI lean towards the latter.\n\ncc @nathansobo @benogle

This error seems localized and specific to `filetype .js` as simply changing the file extension to `.txt` removes the error. The file will load instantly in `.txt` form but often takes 30+ seconds otherwise. If you access the file `sampledata.js.txt`, [this file](https://github.com/SKGrimes/heapshots/blob/master/sampledata.js.txt), after changing it to a .txt file, it loads immediately. Attempting to open the file in Atom takes **upwards of 30 seconds** and also has **crashed the editor** on severral occasions. It will render the following error every time:\n\n<img width=\"874\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-11-22 at 6 04 16 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7623078/11327084/75375ea6-9149-11e5-94e9-28d4de79b69d.png\">\n_note: this picture is taken of the error in safe mode, i have taste and therefore my theme is much slicker than this._\nThere did not seem to be anything useful in the console, but I neglected to save it.
