But I'm new here, and could use some direction on this one! (thanks)\n\nIn any case, it would be fantastic if \"block comments\" (eg: `/* ... */`) would continue automatically (JSDoc style) when multiple lines are added. For example, starting here:\n\n```\n/**\n * Some comment...[cursor here]\n */\n```\n\nand hitting `Enter`, I would like to end up with:\n\n```\n/**\n * Some comment...\n * [cursor here]\n */\n```\n\nI know that I can use snippets to automatically generate a JSDoc-style comment, but once the block has been started, I need to manually add the asterisk and the whitespace around it with each new line, which gets tedious quickly.\n\nHere, I'm talking about JS specifically, but I'm sure this could apply to other languages as well.\n\nIs this territory for a plugin? If so, is this type of interaction with the editor (one that doesn't really have a specific keybinding, just part of the user's general typing) possible with the atom
