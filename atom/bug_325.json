We disabled subpixel scaling with a flag, but that was only a temporary stopgap measure. The truth is our existing approach to measuring horizontal positions on screen is somewhat ill-conceived, and it needs to be changed.\n## The existing approach\n\nIn our existing approach, we attempt to measure the width of characters in a given context. So, for example, we can determine that the width of an `a` character in the `.source.coffee .meta.function.coffee` is 11px at the current font size. Then, when we calculate the pixel position for a given row and column, we just simply total up the recorded width for every character we encounter.\n\nThe problem is that for non fixed-width fonts, a given character doesn't have a single width. Kerning, ligatures, and other stuff the type rendering engine does can result in an `a` taking up different amount of space in different contexts. I am not an expert in this area yet. What's worse, when subpixel font scaling is turned on, Chrome starts reporting different widths _even for fixed width fonts_. We're going to need a different approach.\n## Idea for a better approach\n\nMy current thinking is that when calculating a pixel position, we need to explicitly measure the distance from the beginning of the line to the column in question rather than consulting our encyclopedia of character widths. This was our original approach but I moved away from it because we were naively reading the DOM whenever we needed to translate positions, which was causing reflows.\n\nBut we actually _can_ safely read this information, so long as we do so either at the start of an update _before_ we actually update the DOM, or at the end of an update, after we are finished updating the DOM. When simply moving the cursor, we can measure before the update. When typing, however, we need to measure _after_ the update in order for the content to be on screen, then trigger another update based on our measurement.\n\nWe may also be able to make these measurements off-DOM, like in an iframe or something. My main concern here is making sure that we capture all the styling that's applied to the text. We may be able to draw a line at the shadow boundary, and just say the only styling that we will apply for purposes of character measurement is the syntax themes. Theme stylesheets could easily be loaded in an iframe via the `atom-styles` element. Or we could set up the entire world in this iframe and measure there.\n\nOr maybe there's some other, better approach to character measurement out there that Atom should apply instead. The main requirements are as follows:\n- Measurement should not force a blocking reflow.\n- Measurement should capture user styling as seamlessly as possible.\n- Measurement should handle different widths being reported for the same character in different contexts, as is currently the case with subpixel font scaling enabled.\n\nCan anyone from the community help out with this? Ideas are welcome if they're specific. Code would be even more helpful. @as-cii I know I'm pinging you on a ton of stuff lately but this seems right in your wheelhouse based on your recent presenter work.\n\n/cc @atom/non-github-maintainers\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6055/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6054","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6054/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6054/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6054/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6054","id":63325847,"number":6054,"title":"Uncaught Error: ioctl(2) failed.","user":{"login":"beoran","id":71289,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/71289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beoran","html_url":"https://github.com/beoran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beoran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beoran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beoran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beoran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beoran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beoran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beoran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beoran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beoran/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-03-20T23:06:44Z","updated_at":"2015-03-21T13:37:58Z","closed_at":"2015-03-21T00:02:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[Enter steps to reproduce below:]\n1.

This is one of the reasons a lot of people don't want to switch over to Atom (yet).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6043/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6042","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6042/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6042/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6042/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/6042","id":63086664,"number":6042,"title":"Fix random mutation spurious errors","user":{"login":"as-cii","id":482957,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/482957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii","html_url":"https://github.com/as-cii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-03-19T20:39:09Z","updated_at":"2015-03-19T21:53:37Z","closed_at":"2015-03-19T21:29:27Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/6042","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/6042","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/6042.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/6042.patch"},"body":"...which were caused by the recent soft-wrap hanging indent change.

it only disables it _only_ in the window where you click the update button. \n# Motivation\n\nAtom-TypeScript runs a separate atom instance (as node) in the background to do the heavy lifting away from the UI thread. We kill this background worker if we get deactivated. \n- _The happy case:_ This means if you only have one atom window open, and run update : the worker is stopped and the files can be deleted and updated by apm. \n- **The issue:** If you have two atom windows open we will have two workers (one with each atom instance). If you start an update in one atom window, the worker will still be running for the other atom window and therefore apm will fail to delete the directory. Furthermore it will delete just enough to leave the whole plugin unusable. \n\nrefs https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/issues/195\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6032/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6031","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6031/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6031/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6031/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6031","id":62964706,"number":6031,"title":"Add support for VIM-like jump lists","user":{"login":"LukeMauldin","id":1440808,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1440808?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeMauldin","html_url":"https://github.com/LukeMauldin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeMauldin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeMauldin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeMauldin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeMauldin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeMauldin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeMauldin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeMauldin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeMauldin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LukeMauldin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-03-19T11:54:06Z","updated_at":"2017-06-09T01:42:08Z","closed_at":"2017-06-09T01:42:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Currently Atom has supported for bookmarks but I must manually set a bookmark and then navigate back to it.
