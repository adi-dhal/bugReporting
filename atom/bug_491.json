`dependencies`\n- You need to have a keychain token or `ATOM_ACCESS_TOKEN` set now to bootstrap packages from atom.io (similar to how atom-shell downloads work).\n- Bundled Textmate bundles have been converted and pushed to new repos using the `language-*` naming convention.\n- `apm publish minor` now automatically pushes the tag (and
