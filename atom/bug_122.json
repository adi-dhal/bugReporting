This happens to me regularly when I download a file (e.g. to my\nDownloads folder) and then open it with Atom. When Atom opens, all my existing\nproject folders no longer appear in the editor. The downloaded file does get opened...\nThen if I close/reopen Atom the project folders are still gone...\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Add some project folders to Atom\n2. Close Atom\n3. Open file outside of the aforementioned project folders in Atom (e.g. right click\n   and say open with atom)\n\n**Expected behavior:** I expect my project folders to not get wiped out obviously\n**Actual behavior:** Project folders gone and need to be re-added\n### Versions\n\nLatest Mac OSX\nDarwin 15.5.0 Darwin Kernel Version 15.5.0: Tue Apr 19 18:36:36 PDT 2016;

Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nWhen I already have one window of the editor open, I cannot open another window using `atom <folder_name>` in the command line.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open a editor window (doesn't matter if there are files, can be the default `untitled` one)\n2. Try to open a folder using `atom <folder_name>`\n\nIt may be worth noting that in the dock, I see another instance of Atom opening and closing quickly after running the command.  Feels like the process opens, sees an existing Atom process, and kills itself.\n\n**Expected behavior:** A new editor window opens, with the folder specified as the project folder.\n\n**Actual behavior:** Nothing\n### Versions\n\nUsing OSX El Capitan, 10.11.5 on a Macbook Pro, with the latest stable version of Atom.\n\n```\n~\n❯ atom --version\nAtom    : 1.8.0\nElectron: 0.36.8\nChrome  :

There was nothing in the `~/.atom/nohup.log`.  I repeatedly killed all my electron and atom processes. They'd show up in the `ps` list, just no editor window. \n\nI also attempted moving by `~/.atom` and `~/.config/Atom` out of the way. When I restarted atom, I'd only get the `nohup.log` indicating that atom has successfully started (App load time: xxxms). Per discussion on the #atom chatroom on Freenode, I tried starting it with `-l /tmp/mylog.log` (Atom didn't even create the log file) and then `atom -f` which generated no errors.\n\nFinally, I noticed in `/tmp` I had an `atom-1.8.0-[my username].sock` after I had killed the processes. It was a dead socket. I removed it an atom started up fine. I killed it, replaced my old atom config and storage directories and it started right up.  \n### Workaround\n\nDelete the old, dead socket in `/tmp`. \n### Issue/Solution\n\nI'm not an atom dev, so I'm not sure how the socket communication works, but I feel like there should be a means to check if the socket isn't connected to a running process and report an error if that's the case; or at least indicate something in the foreground logs. \n### Related\n\nThe only bug I could found that's related was the following:\n\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4346\n\nI wasn't sure if I should just append to that one or open a new issue. Feel free to merge/duplicate mark this if maintainers feel it's appropriate. \n### Versions\n\n```\n$atom --version\nAtom    : 1.8.0\nElectron: 0.36.12\nChrome  : 47.0.2526.110\nNode    :
