Background and Context\n\nI'm [hacking on an atom package](https://github.com/briandk/latexer). Jasmine 1.3 (which I believe is Atom's built-in spec runner) doesn't support [`and.callThrough()` syntax](http://jasmine.github.io/2.4/introduction.html#section-Spies:_<code>and.callThrough</code) when spying on methods; it uses the [older `andCallThrough()` syntax](http://jasmine.github.io/1.3/introduction.html#section-Spies:_<code>andCallThrough</code).\n\nNo matter what I've tried to do to specify an alternate test runner (alternate to Jasmine 1.3), [my spec still fails](https://github.com/briandk/latexer/commit/e6ec543854e4aae549dda7259835131d7c52b10e)\n## Expected behavior\n1. When an Atom developer specifies a 2.x Jasmine version `atomTestRunner` in their `package.json` file, Atom will use that framework to run tests.\n2. When the value for `atomTestRunner` doesn't resolve to a valid path, Atom should [throw an error](https://github.com/atom/atom/blame/b3009f13875df5f1c6b04ea7bea522ca87164243/src/main-process/atom-application.coffee#L649-L654) to StdErr.\n\nrefs 2e54ae1e570e66c9467d30986317b8f6e326a548\n## Actual Behavior\n1. Atom uses the built-in Jasmine test runner; specs raise an error of undefined if you try to, say, chain `.and.callThrough()` on a `spyOn()`, presumably because that syntax wasn't valid in Jasmine 1.3. Changing the syntax to the older `andCallThrough()` appeases the spec runner.\n2. Atom uses the built-in Jasmine test runner AND never raises an error\n\n![atom spec fails with undefined error](http://d.pr/i/VmLp+)\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. use `package-generator` to generate a new package `my-package`\n2. add `atomTestRunner` to the `package.json`:\n   \n   ``` json\n   {\n     \"name\": \"my-package\",\n     \"main\": \"./lib/my-package\",\n     \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n     \"description\": \"A short description of your package\",\n     \"keywords\": [\n     ],\n     \"activationCommands\": {\n       \"atom-workspace\": \"my-package:toggle\"\n     },\n     \"repository\": \"https://github.com/atom/my-package\",\n     \"license\": \"MIT\",\n     \"engines\": {\n       \"atom\": \">=1.0.0 <2.0.0\"\n     },\n     \"dependencies\": {\n     },\n     \"atomTestRunner\": \"asdfjkl;\"\n   }\n   ```\n3. at the terminal:\n   \n   ``` shell\n   $ cd path/to/my-package\n   $ apm test\n   ```\n4. Verify no error was raised, even though `asdfjkl;` is definitely not the name of a valid test file\n## Session Info\n### Atom Version\n\n```\nAtom    : 1.9.9\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  :

request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\nWhen a folder (the file doesn't need to be open) is open in Atom and any file within that folder is modified by another editor, Atom will duplicate the file and add an index to the name.\n\n![2016-08-27 11_48_27-github-userscripts](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/136959/18029080/d6e89b02-6c53-11e6-804c-71ae0e1e607a.png)\n\nI'm trying to switch to Atom from another editor. I sometimes switch to the older editor to do things I have not yet learned how to do in Atom. The old editor doesn't update the file content until after I focus on the editor, so I think that is why it doesn't behave in the same manner as Atom. I've noticed that Atom updates all the open files in the background (when the window isn't focused) even when I quickly switch between branches from my bash window.\n\nIt would be nice, and maybe even speed up Atom, if there was a setting to only update the open files when the Atom window has focus.\n\nThe \"autosave\" package is disabled. This issue occurs even if I enable it, therefore I don't think it's related to [this post](https://discuss.atom.io/t/atom-creates-duplicate-files/25968).\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open any folder.\n2. Edit any file (e.g. \"filename.ext\") within the same folder in another editor.\n3. Look in the folder and you'll find a new file with an index (e.g. \"filename(#).ext\").\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n\nOnly one file should exist; if the content in Atom was unsaved, it should prompt to update and lose previous changes, or maybe it should have saved the changes when focus was lost.\n\n**Actual behavior:**\n\nWhen Atom sees that a file has changed, it appears to save the file in an attempt to save any changes, but multiple files end up being saved.\n### Versions\n\nAtom: 1.9.9\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome: 49.0.2623.75\nNode: 5.10.0\nOS: Windows 10 x64 [Version 1607](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12387/windows-10-update-history)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12537/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12536","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12536/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12536/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12536/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12536","id":173590404,"number":12536,"title":"Whitespace preceding a comment is not the comment itself","user":{"login":"chmac","id":690997,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/690997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chmac","html_url":"https://github.com/chmac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chmac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chmac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chmac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chmac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chmac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chmac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chmac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chmac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chmac/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-08-27T10:46:57Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T19:10:59Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T19:10:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#12507 ## Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nI reported this issue gandm/language-babel#234 and @gandm very eloquently explained what the underlying cause of the problem is. Rather than attempt to rephrase, I shall simply quote from [here](https://github.com/gandm/language-babel/issues/234#issuecomment-242779428):\n\n> Little bit complex but it appears that [autoflow](https://github.com/atom/autoflow/blob/master/lib/autoflow.coffee#L18) attempts to determine the line that the cursor is on is part of a paragraph. This eventually calls [language-mode](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/language-mode.coffee#L196) which eventually determines [here](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/language-mode.coffee#L212) that this line isn't a comment line because my grammar doesn't set the whitespace preceeding the // as a comment ( **because it isn't!** ) and therefore determines that this line is part of a paragraph including the line above.\n\nThus, I'm reporting the issue here.\n\nIt might be a design decision, and in fact not a bug at all, but intended behaviour, but such considerations are beyond me, so I'm posting here anyway, feel free to close if this is the intended behaviour.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nUnfortunately I'm not sure if I can make a reproduction now as @gandm has already changed the approach taken by the language-babel plugin which circumvents this issue.\n###

window size.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open Atom\n2. Open two files\n3. Drag one file to the right\n4. Try to resize the splitted windows and make the right smaller/larger\n5. You do not see any \"resize curser\".\n### Versions\n\nAtom    : 1.9.9\nElectron: 1.3.4\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\nNode    : 6.3.0\n\nRunning archlinux:\natom 1.9.9-2\nLinux arch 4.4.19-1-lts #1 SMP Sat Aug 20 21:58:36 CEST 2016 x86_64 GNU/Linux\nxfce4\n\nA side note: I can resize the directory panel on the left, so Its not a bug of my desktop environment. It happens vertically and horizontally. I've also tried this on windows lately and this works.

It is getting better and better with every release.\n\nI noticed a small graphical glitch that I don't know how to fix. In every Linux distribution I tried, whenever I snap Atom to either left or right side of the screen (Ubuntu or Gnome window snap) a white line appears on the right side of the window (always right no matter which side of the screen I snap it to). The window looks fine when it is not snapped and it is theme independent.\n\nSmall thing but would be great if it could be addressed.\n![screenshot from 2016-08-27 02-20-54](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18163728/18014372/9dd28770-6bfd-11e6-8f27-cb9c2c837ef5.png)\n\n![screenshot from 2016-08-27 02-21-17](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18163728/18014379/a9b770d2-6bfd-11e6-9524-b31b99973c21.png)\n\nMany thanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12531/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12530","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12530/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12530/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12530/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12530","id":173457522,"number":12530,"title":"Send notifications to Slack when a CircleCI build of master completes","user":{"login":"as-cii","id":482957,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/482957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii","html_url":"https://github.com/as-cii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-08-26T13:49:35Z","updated_at":"2016-08-26T13:50:12Z","closed_at":"2016-08-26T13:50:12Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/12530","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12530","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12530.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12530.patch"},"body":"/cc: @atom/core \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12530/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12529","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12529/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12529/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12529/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12529","id":173452913,"number":12529,"title":"Disable telemetry on AtomApplication tests and smoke tests","user":{"login":"as-cii","id":482957,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/482957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii","html_url":"https://github.com/as-cii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-08-26T13:27:53Z","updated_at":"2016-08-26T13:44:17Z","closed_at":"2016-08-26T13:44:17Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/12529","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12529","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12529.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12529.patch"},"body":"Unless a choice has been made by the user, the telemetry consent tab always shows up as the first one when opening Atom, thus breaking some of the assumptions we make in main process tests.

search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n\nFor more information on how to write a good [bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) or [enhancement request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\nAtom can be installed through Windows 10 Bash, but it does not run. \n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nSupport Atom for Windows Bash 'WSL' on Windows 10\n- Turn Developer Mode on via Settings > Update & security > For developers.\n- Click the Start button , click Control Panel, click Programs, and then click Turn Windows features on or off.\n- Enable Windows Subsystem for Linux (Beta)\n- To get Bash installed, open Command Prompt and type “bash”\n1. Run `sudo apt-get update`\n   \n   > $ sudo apt-get update\n2. Add repository\n   \n   > $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/atom\n3. Update repository\n   \n   > $ sudo apt-get update\n4. Install Atom\n   \n   > $ sudo apt-get install atom\n5. Run Atom\n   \n   > $ atom .\n- Or try `Atom --version` (or any Atom command. They all fail.)\n\n> $ atom --version\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n- Atom to open in current directory. Or Atom to show version. Or do something.\n\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\n- The output from any Atom command is shown below:\n\n```\ndavid@DESKTOP-09AQL1Q:~$ atom --version\ndavid@DESKTOP-09AQL1Q:~$ atom --safe\ndavid@DESKTOP-09AQL1Q:~$ /usr/bin/atom: line 111: 27266 Aborted                 (core dumped) nohup \"$ATOM_PATH\" --executed-from=\"$(pwd)\" --pid=$$ \"$@\" > \"$ATOM_HOME/nohup.out\" 2>&1\n[27266:0825/103701:FATAL:render_sandbox_host_linux.cc(40)] Check failed: 0 == shutdown(renderer_socket_, SHUT_RD). shutdown: Invalid argument\n\n#0 0x000001bfb0ae <unknown>\n#1 0x000001c10f3b <unknown>\n#2 0x000001c114fd <unknown>\n#3 0x0000025e2ae2 <unknown>\n#4 0x0000023cf2f2 <unknown>\n#5 0x0000023d5fd4 <unknown>\n#6 0x0000023ce946 <unknown>\n#7 0x0000011375e1 <unknown>\n#8 0x0000011362d0 <unknown>\n#9 0x000003088b7c main\n#10 0x7fa7abb81f45 __libc_start_main\n#11 0x000000544249 <unknown>\n```\n### Versions\n- The latest? Not sure of the version number.  As the command `$ atom --version` does not work.\n  Run `apt-get install atom` again to make sure it is the latest version?\n\n```\ndavid@DESKTOP-09AQL1Q:~$ sudo apt-get install atom\n[sudo] password for david:\nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree\nReading state information...

It will assume the \"default\" value and use the editor tab length instead.\n\nFor example, the Atom editor default and LESS language both use a tab length of 2 spaces. If you override the default setting for the editor, it's not possible to force LESS to use 2 spaces, because the editor assumes that you want the default and then falls back to the global editor override.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Set tab length to 4 spaces in Atom Editor Settings.\n2. Set LESS language settings to 2-space tabs.\n3. Observe that the language settings input resets itself and that the effective tab length when indenting in LESS files is 4 spaces, not 2.\n\n**Expected behavior:** You can force the tab length to be the default value without it resetting.\n\n**Actual behavior:** If the value matches the default, it will reset to the placeholder version of the setting (`Default: 2`) rather than appearing as an override.\n### Versions\n\n`atom --version`\napmAtom    : 1.9.9\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\n\n`apm --version`\napm  1.10.0\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.12\ngit 2.7.4\n\nOS X 10.11.6\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12518/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12517","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12517/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12517/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12517/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12517","id":173200043,"number":12517,"title":"Uncaught Error: Cannot read property 'object' of undefinedTypeError","user":{"login":"arghav","id":285170,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/285170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arghav","html_url":"https://github.com/arghav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arghav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arghav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arghav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arghav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arghav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arghav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arghav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arghav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arghav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-08-25T13:15:49Z","updated_at":"2016-08-25T15:32:33Z","closed_at":"2016-08-25T14:46:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"All I did was close my laptop, open it again and switch to Atom.
