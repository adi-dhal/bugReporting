timing of this PR has **nothing** to do with the recent open sourcing of TextMate 2. Complete coincidence. We started on it before that happened.\n# Screenshots\n\nIn the following two screen shots, you see Atom loading the theme it is in.\n\n![IR Black Theme](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s199/sh/34eda86d-f4b8-418c-86d4-203835e2eeaa/eb918e8c476a97805d75b63909eb1056/res/e38cb799-8312-424d-b2fc-955016331414/_Users_nathansobo_code_atom_src_app_root-view.coffee-20120809-184450.jpg.jpg)\n\n![Cobalt Theme](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s199/sh/24f9bf02-f8d2-4102-90e5-f746788617d8/01e218bbe07ada026d4490287d559cf4/res/dfde9a51-01ff-48f5-9d79-c7de4a27b1e4/_Users_nathansobo_code_atom_src_app_root-view.coffee-1-1-20120809-184558.jpg.jpg)\n# Motivation\n\nWhen we added support for automatic insertion of paired characters, we only wanted to perform auto-insertion in certain syntactic scopes. For example, we didn't want to insert a matching single quote if we were already inside a string, since in a string a single quote is more likely an apostrophe. \n\nPreviously, we were relying on the tokenizer from the Ace editor to do all of our syntax highlighting, but we didn't want to start building editor features like scope-aware character insertion based on Ace's grammar and scopes. They just didn’t seem well-designed and ubiquitous enough to really serve as the foundation for other serious features.\n\nWe’d been thinking about supporting TextMate for a while, but it just seemed like a lot to bite off when Ace already had a tokenizer we could use. But now the time felt right: TextMate feels like a better solution in the long term based on its well-designed vocabulary of scopes and vast array of language grammars available. There are also a ton of TextMate themes out there that use these same scopes as the basis of their highlighting. SublimeText 2 also uses TextMate language bundles. All in all, supporting TextMate bundles allows us to tap into a vibrant, well-designed ecosystem for language support. If we proceed to develop more sophisticated syntax-awareness, the coherent vocabulary of syntactic scopes could be a viable foundation.\n# Implementation Details\n\nSo, with this pull request, we say goodbye to Ace. We’re not sad about it. Now we have 100% ownership of all of our critical code, and no longer have areas that feel like an Atom-Ace-Frankenstein. Tokenization is now handled completely by our own code, using TextMate language property lists for its rules. Because TextMate grammars rely on special features of the Oniguruma regular expression engine (also used by Ruby 1.9), we needed to add a native extension that gave us access to `OnigRegExp` objects. Our Oniguruma regexes are a bit slower than we’d like, despite extensive profiling and optimization. A newer version of CEF allows us to allocate JavaScript arrays with a non-zero initial size, which should help a bit more. But we’re pretty sure we’re going to need to handle tokenization asynchronously due to the slowness of our regexes. This is something we needed to do anyway to load extremely large files quickly, even with our previous tokenizer based on the faster stock regex engine.\n\nWe’re also parsing TextMate themes and converting them to CSS, with TextMate’s CSS-like scope selectors making this a natural process. One difference: TextMate supports dotted scope selectors and matches on prefixes. For example, a scope of `variable.assignment.coffee` in the grammar can match the selector of `variable` in a theme. Our solution is to expand out every potential prefix when rendering elements. So the span representing the variable assignment token would have `variable`, `variable-assignment`, and `variable-assignment-coffee` as classes.

It integrates with the same command-oriented interface that we use to search a single document. In the _Sam command language_, `X` is composed with other commands to run a search across multiple files, like this:\n\n```\nX/.*\\.c/ /void/  # find all occurrences of 'void' in files with a .c extension\nX s/vim/atom # substitute vim with atom in all files\n```\n\n`X` is the analog of `x`, which loops over matches in a single file. `X` loops over files in the project.\n\nWe've implemented only an extremely small subset of this so far: `Xx`. This composes scanning the file system with selecting all matches in a file. Whenever we detect a multi-file operation, we automatically display the results of the operation in a preview pane above the command panel's mini-editor, like this:\n\n![Screenshot](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s199/sh/73d4510e-f6a2-4013-b354-7d77687a6d1a/da0894a7fbe9aae931b5ba543e4c0b5e/res/1ffc5064-fe6e-4e53-a683-be0c707f15c3/_Users_nathansobo_code_atom_src_app_edit-session.coffee-20120725-142519.jpg.jpg)\n\nClicking any of these operations will open the associated file and select the match in the active editor. We still need to add features to this menu, which will include a tree-like display based on file's location in the project tree and the ability to include / exclude results once we enable find/replace in addition to just find.\n\nThis feature is implemented in terms of a search program written in C called _The Silver Searcher_. We include a compiled version inside the app bundle. We'll have to include alternate version for different platforms when the time comes. This pull request also includes the first API for running a child process, which we had to use to run the search program.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/31/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/30","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/30/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/30/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/30/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/30","id":5472101,"number":30,"title":"Improve undo manager","user":{"login":"probablycorey","id":596,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/596?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey","html_url":"https://github.com/probablycorey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2012-07-06T19:22:52Z","updated_at":"2014-06-18T13:59:54Z","closed_at":"2012-07-06T19:23:56Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/30","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/30","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/30.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/30.patch"},"body":"Undoing a snippet expansion was leaving stale tab stops in the edit session, which occasionally caused artifacts when pressing `tab` after the undo. We realized that the undo manager potentially needed to undo/redo more than just changes to the buffer, but also state associated with those changes. In this case, when you remove the text inserted by the snippet, you also need to destroy the snippet's extra state.\n\nThis led to an overhaul of the UndoManager class. Previously, it was tightly coupled to Buffer, observing its changes. Now UndoManager takes generic operation objects, which have optional `do`, `undo`, and `redo` methods. The `do` and `redo` methods are similar, except `redo` is only triggered when redo-ing, whereas do is triggered on the initial push to the undo manager as well.\n\nWe used this new generic facility to manage selection state as well. Previously, each \"transaction\" object in the undo manager was associated with an array of ranges that were selected before / after the transaction. Now, `EditSession` has a `transact` method that pushes operations before / after the rest of the transaction to manage selection state on undo / redo.\n\nOne further detail is that the undo and redo methods take an optional `editSession` argument. This can be used to contextualize _where_ the undo/redo is being performed. This is necessary, for example, when we undo a change to the same buffer in another editor. We don't want to restore the selection in the other editor, but in the current editor.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/30/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/29","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/29/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/29/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/29/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/29","id":5355141,"number":29,"title":"Meta-b fuzzy-finds on current open buffers","user":{"login":"nathansobo","id":1789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo","html_url":"https://github.com/nathansobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2012-06-29T16:07:13Z","updated_at":"2014-07-23T06:34:08Z","closed_at":"2012-06-29T16:15:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/29","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/29","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/29.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/29.patch"},"body":"One cool thing... when the buffer you select is not open in the current editor, this automatically switches to an editor that _does_ have the buffer and switches to the buffer there. I think this helps you keep buffers organized. You can put all the specs on the right pane, for instance, but still quickly jump to an open spec from any pane without opening it there. It eliminates having to switch first to the desired pane before opening the desired buffer. Now, you only have to decide which pane to put a buffer in when you open it, and then quick-find to switch to it there in the future.\n\nTo implement this, I added an option to RootView.open called 'allowActiveEditorChange'. If this is true (defaults to false), the call to open may switch to another editor to recycle an existing edit session for the given path. It will always try to recycle edit sessions on the current active editor.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/29/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/28","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/28/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/28/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/28/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/28","id":5289310,"number":28,"title":"Snippets","user":{"login":"nathansobo","id":1789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo","html_url":"https://github.com/nathansobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2012-06-27T04:51:04Z","updated_at":"2014-07-19T17:57:03Z","closed_at":"2012-06-27T04:58:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/28","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/28","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/28.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/28.patch"},"body":"The snippets extension is inspired by TextMate and the UltiSnips vim extension. So far, it supports fewer features. Snippets can have numbered tab stops, and the tab stops can have placeholder text. Pressing tab after the snippet prefix triggers the snippet, then subsequent tabs/shift-tabs move forward/backward through the tab stops. If the cursor is moved outside of the tab stops, it is terminated so that the next tab/shift-tab behaves as normal. Nested snippets, tab-stop mirroring, and other advanced features are not yet supported.\n\nThis branch introduces some cool low-level features that were developed to support snippets. The first is the concept of anchors and anchor ranges on edit sessions. Any extension can insert points and ranges at specific locations in the buffer, and as the buffer changes the locations of these \"anchors\" will be updated to maintain their inserted position in the file's content. This supports the tab stops. The snippet encodes where a tab stop is located relative to the snippet, but anchors are used to track that tab stop location even as the user edits the buffer as the advance through the snippet.\n\nThe second feature is a method on events triggered by the keymap called `abortKeyBinding`. This allows certain keybindings to \"shadow\" other bindings. For example, snippet introduces 2 new bindings for tab. One is to advance to the next tab stop, and the other is to expand the snippet. If we aren't in an active snippet, then there's no tab stop to advance to so we abort that binding and try the next, which tries to expand a snippet. If the current word prefix doesn't match a snippet, then we can't do this either, so we abort and handle the tab as normal. This allows extension users to associate snippet expansion with _any_ key they choose to. If the situation is not valid for a snippet operation, that key will always work as normal. This was preferable to binding snippet behavior _specifically_ to the tab key, which wouldn't have been very customizable.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/28/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/27","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/27/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/27/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/27/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/27","id":5278158,"number":27,"title":"Actual global settings","user":{"login":"probablycorey","id":596,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/596?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey","html_url":"https://github.com/probablycorey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2012-06-26T16:45:25Z","updated_at":"2013-01-24T18:06:29Z","closed_at":"2013-01-24T18:06:29Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Julie wants tabs to be two spaces EVERYWHERE.

Basically if no binding explicitly matches a keystroke, the keymap looks for partial prefix matches. If there are prefix matches, it enqueues the keystroke, then appends the next keystroke on the next key event.\n\nPane switching is supported by RootView. It queries all panes, then finds which pane currently has focus and length-modulo-increments its index to determine the next pane to focus. This will work with split panes containing editors, or any other view that can accept focus.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/23/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/22","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/22/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/22/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/22/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/22","id":5079683,"number":22,"title":"Command panel fixes","user":{"login":"probablycorey","id":596,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/596?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey","html_url":"https://github.com/probablycorey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2012-06-14T21:07:00Z","updated_at":"2014-07-02T12:49:50Z","closed_at":"2012-06-14T21:07:32Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/22","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/22","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/22.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/22.patch"},"body":"Searching text using the command panel expands folds.
