Similar to the Octicons, but has custom icons created for Atom only. Initially includes icons for the Outline view:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-06-01 at 2 23 25 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378023/26665740/a857d79a-46d6-11e7-8601-eecfbec0bdcf.png)\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nJust like the Octicons `icon icon-xxx` classes, but grouped with an `icon-entity` prefix. Example:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<span class=\"icon icon-entity-array\">array</span>\r\n<span class=\"icon icon-entity-boolean\">boolean</span>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nA better approach would be to use SVG for the icons, instead of a font. Then the icons could be multi colored, be animated, easier to position without sub-pixel blurryness and easier to update/maintain.\r\n\r\nDownside: You can't just use a class to add an icon. The SVG needs to be added to the DOM. Atom would need some sort of `<atomicon name=\"array\" />` to `<svg class=\"atomicon atomicon--array\"><path d=....</svg>` injector. Like [etch-octicon](https://github.com/joefitzgerald/etch-octicon).\r\n\r\nMaybe still worth to try that before making these part of the official style guide. This PR is mostly to add icons to the Outline view package.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nThe Octicons are also in core.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nMore relevant icons.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nMaintenance cost.\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\n\"Atomicon\" name: @Alhadis (somewhere in one of those

In my own personal use-case, its highly annoying to mouse over to the tree view and have the arrow always animate in and out. Since I don't use docks, I would like to disable. Alternatively, it would be nice if this functionality was behind a setting that I could toggle off. \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Mouse over to tree-view, see arrow appear\r\n2. Mouse out to main editor window, see arrow disappear\r\n3. Repeat.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\nI would expect to be able to disable this via disabling an external package, or a setting to disable.  \r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n1.17.*","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14655/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14654","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14654/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14654/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14654/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14654","id":231713137,"number":14654,"title":"Improve confirm documentation","user":{"login":"UziTech","id":97994,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/97994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech","html_url":"https://github.com/UziTech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-05-26T19:17:25Z","updated_at":"2017-09-20T20:07:46Z","closed_at":"2017-09-20T20:07:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/14654","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14654","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14654.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14654.patch"},"body":"### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nUpdated atom.confirm documentation to include what happens if dialog is closed without selecting an option\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nI'm not 100% sure this is correct on all OSes \r\n\r\nI had to do quite a bit of experimentation on Windows to figure out all the edge cases.\r\n\r\nMost of the information I got from the [dialog.showMessageBox](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/dialog.md#dialogshowmessageboxbrowserwindow-options-callback) documentation but there seems to be quite a few differences between Oses\r\n\r\n<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14653","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14653/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14653/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14653/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14653","id":231686497,"number":14653,"title":"macOS: nothing happens with \"Reopen Project\" when all windows are closed","user":{"login":"brunnopleffken","id":3427344,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3427344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunnopleffken","html_url":"https://github.com/brunnopleffken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunnopleffken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunnopleffken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunnopleffken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunnopleffken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunnopleffken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunnopleffken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunnopleffken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunnopleffken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunnopleffken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-05-26T17:19:58Z","updated_at":"2017-05-26T19:38:52Z","closed_at":"2017-05-26T19:38:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

However, the issue appears for every custom color profile. \r\n\r\nThis issue is present in the current beta, as well as atom stable since a long time.\r\nThe color blocks change in shape and size, depending on what is shown in the editor.\r\nItâ€™s especially noticable on dark backgrounds.\r\n\r\nBut images say more than a thousand words:\r\n\r\n__Atom Beta with packages__\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6564077/26487302/3cc036fc-41ff-11e7-9bcf-c4b11e20ac12.png)\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6564077/26487303/3cc2dc68-41ff-11e7-98eb-01f6aeced1ed.png)\r\n\r\n__Atom Beta in safe-mode__\r\n![safe mode](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6564077/26487301/3ca68d38-41ff-11e7-8a99-3e671c1296c1.png)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open Atom\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** The background is rendered in a single color\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** The background includes blocky color-shifts\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.18.0-beta1\r\nElectron: 1.3.15\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\nMacOS   : 10.12.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI noticed this issue some time earlier in an earlier slack beta, so this might be an electron issue.\r\n\r\n__The color profiles I use__\r\n[ColorProfiles.zip](https://github.com/atom/atom/files/1031305/ColorProfiles.zip)\r\n\r\nThe issue is not exclusive to the custom color profiles though. If you switch to _Adobe RGB (1998)_ the same issue appears.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14648","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14648/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14648/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14648/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14648","id":231563468,"number":14648,"title":"Opening a pending pane no longer correctly correctly triggers activation","user":{"login":"thomasjo","id":3622,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasjo","html_url":"https://github.com/thomasjo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasjo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasjo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasjo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasjo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasjo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasjo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasjo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasjo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasjo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":418477269,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/regression","name":"regression","color":"b60205","default":false},{"id":505038679,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-05-26T08:46:45Z","updated_at":"2017-06-19T02:18:12Z","closed_at":"2017-06-06T14:09:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nOpening a file as a pending pane no longer triggers activation as expected. The end result is that `atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor` returns `undefined` until the user interacts with the text editor in some manner (e.g. moving the cursor or making the pane non-pending).\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Launch Atom in any folder that contains some files that can be opened.\r\n2. Click on any file in the tree view (ensure it is opened in a pending pane).\r\n3. Open up the developer tools console.\r\n4. Execute `atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor()`\r\n5. Notice the method returns `undefined`\r\n6. Click anywhere in the (pending) text editor.\r\n7. Execute `atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor()`\r\n8. Notice the method returns a `TextEditor` object.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Opening a file in a pending pane should immediately mark the text editor as active.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** The text editor in the pending pane is not marked as active until the user directly interacts with the pane/editor.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100% of the time.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom v1.7.2, and v1.19.0-dev-85e65ffd1.\r\nUbuntu 16.04 LTS\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThis regression is the cause of the following issues:\r\n* https://github.com/atom/status-bar/issues/194","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14647","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14647/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14647/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14647/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14647","id":231553277,"number":14647,"title":"How to custom file associations","user":{"login":"magicdawn","id":4067115,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4067115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/magicdawn","html_url":"https://github.com/magicdawn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magicdawn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magicdawn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magicdawn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magicdawn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magicdawn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magicdawn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magicdawn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magicdawn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magicdawn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-05-26T07:57:55Z","updated_at":"2017-05-26T10:36:01Z","closed_at":"2017-05-26T10:36:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"duplicates of https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/1718\r\nbut since that issue is locked, I'm creating new one here.

By hosting the logic in `PaneContainerElement`, we could only focus/move/copy between panes in a specific pane container (e.g., a single pane container in the workspace center). To make it possible to focus/move/copy between _all_ panes in the workspace, relocate the logic to `WorkspaceElement`.\r\n- Add [tests for `nearestVisiblePaneInDirection`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/e3c612b261d658f492d7456dc9c18ccb48f23aa6/spec/workspace-element-spec.js#L37-L232), which provides the core logic for the higher-level functions like `focusPaneViewAbove`, `moveActiveItemToPaneAbove`, `focusPaneViewOnLeft`, etc.\r\n    - Test the generic logic extensively (i.e., the logic that is independent of whether the given pane resides in the workspace center or a dock)\r\n    - *Also* test the navigation between docks and the workspace center\r\n- Since the core directional logic is tested in the new tests above, simplify the [tests for the higher-level functions](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/e3c612b261d658f492d7456dc9c18ccb48f23aa6/spec/workspace-element-spec.js#L234-L483) (e.g., `focusPaneViewAbove`, `moveActiveItemToPaneAbove`, `focusPaneViewOnLeft`) to avoid unnecessary duplication.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\n- We could perhaps leave the existing functions in `PaneContainerElement` and update them to focus/move/copy across pane containers, but it would seem odd (to me) to have something in `PaneContainerElement` operate on elements that exist in _other_ pane containers.\r\n- We could leave the existing functionality in place and _add_ new commands that provide the ability to focus/move/copy across pane containers.\r\n    - This would result in more code to maintain.\r\n    - It would require us to come up with command names that distinguish the old behavior from the new behavior (e.g. `window:focus-pane-above` and `window:seriously-focus-pane-above` :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)\r\n    - I can't think of a compelling reason to the limit pane navigation commands to a single container. If you know of real world value that developers get from only being able to focus/move/copy between panes in a single pane container, please let me know. :pray:\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nThe existing commands reside in core, and this change updates them to support the docks that were recently added to core.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nDevelopers gain the ability to focus/move/copy across *all* visible panes. Developers are no longer limited to focusing/moving/copying between panes in the workspace center.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\n`PaneContainerElement` is not part of Atom's public API, but it's possible that some packages are relying on functions in `PaneContainerElement`. This pull request removes several functions from `PaneContainerElement`. If any packages are relying on those non-public functions, those packages will encounter errors when attempting to invoke those functions. Hopefully package authors would discover those issues during the next beta release, so that they could adjust their packages accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/pull/1484 introduced the ability to navigate directionally between panes.\r\n\r\n### Demo\r\n\r\n![demo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2988/26453346/5f8ec992-4131-11e7-9171-6aef04f34055.gif)\r\n\r\n### Proposed Test Plan\r\n\r\nI propose using the steps below to verify that this PR is providing the desired behavior. For now, I've done a sanity check in dev mode, and things appear to be working as expected. Once folks have had a chance to review this pull request, if folks are :+1: on the overall approach, I'll run through all of these steps to verify the behavior:\r\n\r\n- [x] `window:focus-pane-above`\r\n  -
