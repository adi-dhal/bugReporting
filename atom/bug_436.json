digging into #2679, I noticed that all files are loaded with the null grammar until the specific grammar is loaded. This creates the issue in #2679, but also makes the editor feel dumpy on load as there is a sizable chunk of time where files are not colorized. \n\nSo this preloads / sync loads the grammars needed by deserialized buffers. \n\nI just serialize the grammar name, and on deserialize, the `TokenizedBuffer` calls `atom.syntax.requestGrammarPreload`, which emits an event, which the relevant package handles and loads its grammars sync. This whole process happens _right_ before the soon-to-be-new TokenizedBuffer chooses its grammar. \n\nThe biggest issue is that nowhere do we map grammar names to the name of the package, so I have a shitty hardcoded line in there to do this work until I have a legit solution. Options for solving this issue:\n1. on serialize, serialize the name of the package, rather than the grammar name\n2. add a package.json field specifying the grammar names that the package provides. Since grammars are not activated right away, I have no other way to read the name of the grammar. \n\nI'm leaning toward 1 because it will be hard to get people to change their package.json's and people will forget to add this field anyway.\n\nWhat do you guys think about all this?\n\nWill fix #2679 if we decide to go down this route.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2699","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2699/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2699/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2699/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2699","id":36205130,"number":2699,"title":"Render highlights on their own layer to avoid GPU artifacts","user":{"login":"nathansobo","id":1789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo","html_url":"https://github.com/nathansobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-06-20T21:43:01Z","updated_at":"2014-06-20T23:03:28Z","closed_at":"2014-06-20T23:03:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/2699","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2699","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2699.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2699.patch"},"body":"Previously, when the last highlight div was removed from the lines layer, chunks of the lines would sometimes disappear.

think internally Atom uses a trimmed down version because it seems to be missing some JS components like [Collapse](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#collapse) which I need for my package. To fix that problem I included the full bootsrap.min.js with my project and require the file like this: \n`require './ext/bootstrap.min.js'`\nThis works just fine on OS X and I'm able to use all the Bootsrap components. However I just tried to load the package on Windows and I'm getting this error:\n`Failed to activate package named 'Ask-Stack-Atom' Error: Bootstrap's JavaScript requires jQuery`\n\nNow I know Atom (and space-pen) heavily use jQuery so I'm pretty sure it should be installed somewhere.

The bugs referenced were caused by cases where we were forgetting to batch, which caused massive redundant work to be performed. This PR updates the update mechanism to always wait until the end of the current synchronous code block with `process.nextTick`. It seems to be more responsive than `setImmediate`, so this also supplants the mechanism that delayed updates for decorations.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2680","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2680/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2680/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2680/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2680","id":36125712,"number":2680,"title":"individual descriptions for instructions","user":{"login":"Bengt","id":11575,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bengt","html_url":"https://github.com/Bengt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bengt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bengt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bengt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bengt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bengt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bengt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bengt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bengt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bengt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2014-06-19T22:47:34Z","updated_at":"2014-07-29T01:54:20Z","closed_at":"2014-07-29T01:46:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/2680","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2680","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2680.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2680.patch"},"body":"The proposed style allows properly formatted descriptions and leaves more vertical space to the commands.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2680/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2679","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2679/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2679/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2679/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2679","id":36124738,"number":2679,"title":"Reloading unfolds everything","user":{"login":"benogle","id":69169,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/69169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle","html_url":"https://github.com/benogle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-06-19T22:30:37Z","updated_at":"2014-06-24T15:26:57Z","closed_at":"2014-06-24T15:26:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For a bit, it is all folded like it should be.
