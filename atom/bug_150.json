This caused issues where the application would hang for 30-40 seconds upon basically any action, maybe get as far as clicking a button for it to hang again.\n\nAs you can imagine, hard to develop anything! So I completely uninstalled everything, removed all traces from %appdata% and my user folder (.atom - This is backed up) - I reinstalled a fresh copy of 1.6.1 from the site, everything seemed to be working, until I added a project folder and opened a file... Blank. Nothing, Nada. Even stranger, if I then close atom, relaunch, close the file and undo the close tab, it has it's contents... But no other file does.\n\nAgain, after this I removed all traces again and installed 1.6.0 with no luck resolving the issue, followed by trying out the 1.7.0 beta 3.\n\n**Errors in developer

#8850.\n\nThere seems to be an issue with how Chromium handles the input data for the `setZoomLevelLimits` API: I suspect there's some kind of guard clause that ignores that function call whenever the `min` and the `max` level limits are the same.\n\nAs a stopgap measure, I have changed the max limit to be slightly larger than the minimum so that the configuration gets enforced by Chromium without

#10403.\n\nOn OS X, we noticed that some emojis were not being displayed correctly. This is a problem with the rendering mechanism that Chromium uses and is present in Chrome 50 as well:\n\n![screen shot 2016-03-31 at 11 26

perfectly:\n\n![screen shot 2016-03-31 at 11 26 34](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/14172028/598ebfe8-f736-11e5-892d-e8068e1b7641.png)\n### A workaround\n\nEven with Chrome 50, however, I noticed that GitHub.com was rendering emojis correctly without using PNGs:\n\n![screen shot 2016-03-31 at 11 48

allows Chrome to pick up the right glyph to render instead of the ugly box:\n\n![screen shot 2016-03-31 at 11 31 04](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/14172145/deb5f330-f736-11e5-808e-0bd574c4722a.png)\n\n![screen shot 2016-03-31 at 11 31

51):\n\n![screen shot 2016-03-31 at 11 30 31](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/14172172/f9bd9836-f736-11e5-8c18-d55545381742.png)\n![screen shot 2016-03-31 at 11 30

remove it  as soon as Chrome 51 gets released and Electron is updated.\n\n/cc: @atom/core

entry in the saga of #11214.\n\nThe remaining problem comes down to nodegit's threading model. Nodegit uses a lock to protect against cross-thread memory corruption, race conditions, etc. It also uses libuv's thread pool to do git operations off the main thread.\n\nThe problem is that if a lot of git work gets queued up (as happens any time the window comes to the foreground), we can end up with git operations on all of libuv's threads, waiting to acquire the lock. That sucks, because node uses that same thread pool to do all its async work. So we end up blocking node from doing most anything until our git operations are done.\n\nThis is most noticeable on slow file systems (e.g., network drives). We’d essentially end up blocking node from doing anything while we waited on IO.\n\nInstead of using nodegit’s locking, we’ll use our own serialization mechanism.\n\nThis should also afford us more concurrency in the future if/when we need it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11315/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11314","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11314/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11314/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11314/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11314","id":144592067,"number":11314,"title":"Handle auto-updater errors","user":{"login":"as-cii","id":482957,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/482957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii","html_url":"https://github.com/as-cii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-03-30T13:23:35Z","updated_at":"2016-04-01T07:09:37Z","closed_at":"2016-04-01T07:09:37Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/11314","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11314","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11314.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11314.patch"},"body":"This PR propagates the auto-update errors to the renderer process so that we can handle the error state in the about package and show an appropriate error label.\n\n/cc: @thedaniel @joshaber @atom/core \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11314/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11313","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11313/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11313/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11313/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11313","id":144570555,"number":11313,"title":"Mac OS GPU crash","user":{"login":"Entwicklerpages","id":1769948,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1769948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Entwicklerpages","html_url":"https://github.com/Entwicklerpages","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Entwicklerpages/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Entwicklerpages/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Entwicklerpages/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Entwicklerpages/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Entwicklerpages/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Entwicklerpages/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Entwicklerpages/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Entwicklerpages/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Entwicklerpages/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":163641905,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/atom","name":"atom","color":"f7c6c7","default":false},{"id":98445015,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/mac","name":"mac","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-03-30T12:16:21Z","updated_at":"2016-04-17T03:39:53Z","closed_at":"2016-04-16T20:17:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\n\nOn Mac OS X 10.9.5 Atom causes a crash of the GPU spontaneously. The crash happens in Mac Fullscreen mode and normal window mode. Happened three times at the same mac. The screen went gray and the mac didn't respond. Even keyboard shortcuts for killing Atom or shutting down didn't work. I must kill the mac with a long press on the power button. After the third time the mac had a hard drive failure and I need hours to revive him, so I'm afraid of using Atom or debugging it. But maybe others can solve the issue. \n\nIf it helps, the crash happens always when I'm editing .less files. The first two times I tried to define a variable for a font-familiy, the third time I tired to set the font-familiy directly an it worked (even the autocomplete). But before or while I save the change Atom crashes.\n\nHere are the kernel logs before the crash:\n\n> 29.03.16 17:46:16,000 kernel[0]: [1:0:0] GPU HangState 0x00000000, HangFlags 0x00000006: IndividualEngineHang 0, NonEngineBlockHang 1, FenceNotRetired 1, PerEngineReset 0, FullAsicReset 1\n\nAlso there is a Atom Helper [Crash Report](https://gist.github.com/Entwicklerpages/fd89110d7c3c842eaae898238372afd1)\n### Versions\n\nI'm using Atom 1.6.0\nI have installed the following packages:\n- build@0.58.0\n-
