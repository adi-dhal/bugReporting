Atom is running in dev mode, it sets `process.env.NODE_ENV` to \"production\". (The relevant code is here: https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/a5fdf3e18a512349e7efb91b3c297b1a2b91bf63/src/initialize-application-window.coffee#L20) This improves the speed of React by disabling its debug mode.\n\nBut if Atom is already running, and already has `file.txt` open, and one runs `atom file.txt` from the command line, the command line's environment is used to overwrite Atom's current `process.env`. Most people don't have `NODE_DEV` set in their environment, so React falls back to its slow debug mode. \n\nThe code responsible for \"cloning\" the environment is https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/a5fdf3e18a512349e7efb91b3c297b1a2b91bf63/src/environment-helpers.js#L75 Notice that it deletes the existing environment.\n\nIf React starts in production mode, it won't create some key debugging data structures. If it later changes to dev mode (because `process.env.NODE_DEV` becomes undefined), it will try to access those structures and crash.\n\nThis bug is responsible for several reported issues in packages that I maintain: https://github.com/Floobits/atom-term3/issues/63\nhttps://github.com/Floobits/floobits-atom/issues/121\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12023","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12023/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12023/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12023/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12023","id":161581931,"number":12023,"title":"Got \"gyp ERR\" When Install Plugins After Update Linux Kernel","user":{"login":"EAimTY","id":13065214,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/13065214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EAimTY","html_url":"https://github.com/EAimTY","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EAimTY/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EAimTY/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EAimTY/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EAimTY/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EAimTY/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EAimTY/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EAimTY/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EAimTY/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EAimTY/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":175213356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/question","name":"question","color":"ededed","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-06-22T02:39:17Z","updated_at":"2016-06-29T20:44:30Z","closed_at":"2016-06-29T20:44:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I got an error when I install plugins for atom after compile and install Linux Kernel4.6.2\n\n![ERROR](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13065214/16252950/106d203c-3865-11e6-8234-8bbecd90f329.png)\n\nI am using Atom 1.8.0 on Debian8. \nThe way of compile and install Linux Kernel is [here](http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/debian-ubuntu-building-installing-a-custom-linux-kernel/)\nHow to solve it?\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12022","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12022/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12022/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12022/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12022","id":161580292,"number":12022,"title":"Consider changing the TextEditor documentation","user":{"login":"DamnedScholar","id":4084322,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4084322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DamnedScholar","html_url":"https://github.com/DamnedScholar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DamnedScholar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DamnedScholar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DamnedScholar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DamnedScholar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DamnedScholar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DamnedScholar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DamnedScholar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DamnedScholar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DamnedScholar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":104428530,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":225560994,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/feedback","name":"feedback","color":"fbca04","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-06-22T02:22:17Z","updated_at":"2016-06-29T22:32:46Z","closed_at":"2016-06-29T22:32:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[The documentation](https://atom.io/docs/api/v1.8.0/TextEditor) for the TextEditor class includes a very mischievous example that has the effect of writing in all open TextEditors at the same time.

For example, when pressing ctrl+p to open the file palette, typing something in is very laggy while Atom looks for matching files character by character.\n\nTo improve performance, we can decouple (run on separate ticks) rendering of the palette and result gathering (and possibly provide a loading animation while results are being gathered).\n\nThis will make typing always smooth regardless of how long it takes to load results.\n\nWas the design of the palette meant to be synchronous? The only advantage I see for synchronous rendering is that typing and pressing enter will guarantee a certain result to exist by the time enter is pressed, while decoupling rendering will cause enter to possibly do nothing until enter is pressed when a result is present, and the present result might not be the exact result that the user intended. (This is how OS X's Spotlight Search palette works, the latter asynchronous form).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12014/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12013","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12013/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12013/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12013/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12013","id":161294195,"number":12013,"title":"Typing enter before a closing bracket results in wrong indentation on new line","user":{"login":"adamreisnz","id":490562,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/490562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreisnz","html_url":"https://github.com/adamreisnz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreisnz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreisnz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreisnz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreisnz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreisnz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreisnz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreisnz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreisnz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreisnz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-06-20T21:03:03Z","updated_at":"2016-06-22T02:45:09Z","closed_at":"2016-06-21T23:51:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"See example:\n\n![ss](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ydrj3pjiofafwec/wrong%20indentation%20with%20closing%20bracket.gif?dl=1)\n\nWhen you press `enter` with the cursor positioned just before the closing bracket, the indentation of the new line is one unit off.\n\nThis is on Atom 1.10.0-dev-e5a3c9e, OS X 10.11.5.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12013/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12012","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12012/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12012/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12012/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12012","id":161283515,"number":12012,"title":"Building a release","user":{"login":"jsloyer","id":154126,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/154126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer","html_url":"https://github.com/jsloyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsloyer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":175213356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/question","name":"question","color":"ededed","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-06-20T20:14:47Z","updated_at":"2016-06-20T20:58:57Z","closed_at":"2016-06-20T20:58:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I am curious how atom builds a release.
