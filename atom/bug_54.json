sharp):\r\n![1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2271900/25095951/8224dbfa-23d0-11e7-8fad-b3e2dc174c09.png)\r\n![2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2271900/25095952/822ac560-23d0-11e7-9b6b-326dc1d7532d.png)\r\n\r\n#### something i discovered:\r\nonly when i scroll to a specific position the text gets blurry, otherwise text is sharp, the chance is about 50%\r\n\r\nI open dev tools found that how text is scroll is by css transform translate property, and it is scrolled pixel by pixel, the css pixel was equivalent to 1.5 physical pixel, so when i scroll a  pixel, it translate a pixel, a css pixel was between 2 physical pixels, then the text gets blurry like pic above.\r\n\r\n![q](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2271900/25096424/b5cbe1c2-23d2-11e7-8d1a-1239d00cf04a.png)\r\n\r\nAs soon as i found that i set my system dpi scaling to 200%, 1 css pixel = 2 physical pixel, there is no factional physical pixel value, and the blurry text issue no longer occurred.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, 100% dpi scale or 300% dpi scale won't occur this problem.\r\n\r\nI guess this was due to hardware acceleration relating issue, so I have tried that opem atom by `atom --disable-gpu`, and the blurry problem wasn't occurred. So `--disable-gpu` was a walk around by now\r\n\r\nI have tried that apply a style `body{transform:translate3D(0, 1px, 0)}` on my chrome browser, the text on web page gets blurry too. Maybe it's the problem how blink render transformed element.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14237/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14236","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14236/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14236/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14236/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14236","id":222173638,"number":14236,"title":"Opening new project from context menu opens atom with tree view collapsed ","user":{"login":"ungb","id":5624870,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5624870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb","html_url":"https://github.com/ungb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":418477269,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/regression","name":"regression","color":"b60205","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-04-17T16:59:19Z","updated_at":"2017-04-17T20:53:59Z","closed_at":"2017-04-17T20:53:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\r\n\r\n* [x] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nOpening new project opens atom with tree view collapsed \r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. create a new folder \r\n2.

Atom should at least warn the user that their version of atom is not supported by that package, or wouldn't allow the package to be enabled/updated/installed like with regular community packages.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Install a git package that doesn't support your version of atom. I have set up a package called [`test-engines-package`](https://atom.io/packages/test-engines-package) for this situation at https://github.com/UziTech/test-engines-package\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** \r\n\r\nSomewhere Atom should warn that this package does not support this version of Atom\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** \r\n\r\nNothing.

I am on mac, thus I have gone through the logs in console, there seems to be a lot, even regarding the Atom itself, but I have no idea how to analyse that. I am using just a few plugins (mostly TypeScript related), which I would not consider demanding (but who am I to judge ....). I deal with TypeScript files mostly. My machine is MacBook Pro 2015 / 2,7 GHz Intel Core i5 / 8 GB 1867 MHz DDR3 / Intel Iris Graphics 6100 1536 MB . All I can say is that it seems to me that Atom crashes always when new linter warning appears exactly at the time when the project bundle is being compiled automatically after saving some file (automatisation is not related to Atom itself, I mostly use Angular CLI in my projects). There seems to be several different occurrences of crashing. Sometimes Atom just freezes, other times it quits and just recently, it crashed down my entire OS forcing it to restart. I am using many other tools on the very same machine (even CPU/GPU highly demanding such as VR/3D editing software) and it crashes only when Atom is on. I am sorry I am not more specific (I have decided to create this issue to be able to be more specific). I welcome any suggestion -> \"How To\" troubleshoot Atom crash? / What detail info to share to receive best advice? / What posts regarding Atom crashes are best to read? / What docs related to Atom crash are best to study? ... anything.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14219","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14219/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14219/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14219/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14219","id":221959708,"number":14219,"title":"Cancelling closing windows seems to be not working.","user":{"login":"baosen","id":1417444,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1417444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baosen","html_url":"https://github.com/baosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baosen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722939,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"e6e6e6","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-04-15T16:57:36Z","updated_at":"2017-04-17T07:50:56Z","closed_at":"2017-04-17T07:50:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

option in glob to disable directories from being returned when\r\nfinding paths to transpile during compilation\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\nBefore this PR, building Atom involved transpiling all babel paths, coffeescript files, cson files, etc. by globbing for all paths matching (essentially) `**/*.js`, `**/*.coffee`, etc. Node modules like term.js appear in the directory structure as `node_modules/term.js/<contents>`, which previously caused the folder `node_modules/term.js` to be added to a list of paths to transpile under the assumption that it was a file. This causes an error when [trying to read the folder](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/compile-cache.js#L84)) `node_modules/term.js`. This PR fixes that by enabling the `nodir` option, which filters out any directories from being in the results. While I only specifically witnessed this issue in finding javascript files, the bug also exists in the coffeescript, CSON, PEG.js, and custom transpilers if someone names a directory *.coffee, *.cson, or something else expected to be transpiled.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\nOne could check if the path attempting to be transpiled is actually a directory where the error occurs right before transpiling, but glob already checks if the path is a directory.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\nProposed update to building atom\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\nCan include node_modules named like module.js.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\nIn the future, if the [transpiler ](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/compile-cache.js#L83) (or a custom one) may support directories? In this event, a glob pattern that ends with a `/` still grabs directories (even if `nodir` is enabled).\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\nNone","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14216","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14216/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14216/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14216/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14216","id":221946426,"number":14216,"title":"Files uneditable on Atom 1.17 beta","user":{"login":"ozo2003","id":5328929,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5328929?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozo2003","html_url":"https://github.com/ozo2003","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozo2003/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozo2003/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozo2003/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozo2003/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozo2003/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozo2003/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozo2003/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozo2003/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ozo2003/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-04-15T12:47:02Z","updated_at":"2017-04-17T20:29:29Z","closed_at":"2017-04-17T20:29:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\r\n\r\nFiles are uneditable in 1.17.0-beta2 or 1.17.0-beta1 or 1.17.0-beta0.

That\r\nway, dropping it won't cause it to change size.\r\n\r\nThis kinda-but-not-really fixes #14209.
