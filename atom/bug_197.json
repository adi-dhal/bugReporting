use Atom on Mac 90% of my time and I really think the right click menu can be improved to make my life much easier and make the world a better place in general :D \nSo this is how the current right click menu looks like when I have many windows (aka projects) open at the same time:\n![atom right click](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/939602/11501061/9854cccc-9831-11e5-8082-e168fc120a48.png)\n\nMeanwhile on Sourcetree which is another favorite I use all the day too : \n![source tree

other open projects (including minimized windows that cmd + ` ignore)\n2- the top part of the menu is even more interesting because I can easily open recently closed projects so it's much easier and safe to close projects I'm not working on right now but I may need to work on soon\n3- it feels more native and Mac-ish :D\n\nAtom 1.2.4 on Mac
