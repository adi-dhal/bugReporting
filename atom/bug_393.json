Steps to reproduce\n1. Open a new buffer.\n2. Press tab key. (A single character, the width of two spaces, appears.)\n3. Save that file.\n4. Run `hexdump -C` on it.\n## Expected behavior\n\nAn ASCII tab character followed by a line feed, like:\n\n```\n> hexdump -C test\n00000000  09 0a                                             |..|\n00000002\n```\n## Actual behavior\n\n```\n> hexdump -C test\n00000000  20 20 0a                                          |  .|\n00000003\n```\n\nThis shows that the file consists of three bytes: two ASCII spaces followed by a line feed.\n\nMoreover, opening the corrected file (with an ASCII tab) in Atom is not observably different to the file with two ASCII spaces. Both are represented the same in the UI.\n\nI am using \"Version 0.136.0 (0.136.0)\".\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3996/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3995","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3995/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3995/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3995/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3995","id":47144003,"number":3995,"title":"How to fold level 1 code but not comments","user":{"login":"joelstein","id":152397,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/152397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelstein","html_url":"https://github.com/joelstein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelstein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelstein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelstein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelstein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelstein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelstein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelstein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelstein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelstein/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-10-29T12:48:13Z","updated_at":"2016-12-27T01:50:45Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I recently made the transition from long-time use of TextMate to Atom.

It would be nice to use the same pattern to subscribe to things like `core:cancel` and `click`. Currently click handlers need to be registered with `addEventListener`.\n\nWe've decided to expand the role of the command registry, renaming it to the event registry and using it to register event handlers for both native and custom events. This will ensure a consistent event subscription experience for package authors:\n## Tasks\n- [x] Expand jQuery on/trigger retrofit to cover all event types\n  - [ ] Ensure vim mode specs still pass\n- [ ] Honor `::bubbles` property for native events\n- [ ] Allow event capture in addition to bubbling\n- [ ] Retrofit addEventListener to add events to event registry\n- [ ] Rename to `EventRegistry`\n- [ ] Assign to `atom.events` and deprecate `atom.commands`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3984/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3983","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3983/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3983/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3983/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3983","id":47033553,"number":3983,"title":"Changing
