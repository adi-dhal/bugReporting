Disable \"Reopen Last Item\" until a document has been closed.\n2. Rename \"Reopen Last Item\" to \"Reopen Closed Document\"\n\nJustification:\nIn the absence of a \"Open Recent...\", the wording of the \"Reopen Last Item\" menu option is confusing. Nearly every time I use Atom as a new user, I launch Atom and go to File > Reopen Last Item. It doesn't do anything. See #5718.\n\nAs I understand it, it seems to actually be more similar to a browser's \"Reopen Closed Tab\", no? Chrome has \"Reopen Closed Tab\". Until this is made moot by #4241, we should rename that menu item to \"Reopen Closed Document\" or something to that effect.\n\nPart of the confusion is that \"Reopen Last Item\" has the same placement as the standard \"Open Recent...\" menu option, but they don't operate the same way. We should disable it until Atom is in a state where the menu item actually does anything.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6111/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6110","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6110/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6110/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6110/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6110","id":64570447,"number":6110,"title":"Editor

Motivation\n\nCurrently, any npm modules we work on (e.g. `text-document`) need to use jasmine 1.3 so we can run specs in Atom, which is really useful for debugging. Without Atom's monkey-patched `waitsFor`, Jasmine 1.3 is basically unusable for testing async code (it only supports polling, no callbacks). Rather than have `text-document` and other libraries vendor atom/atom's customized version of jasmine 1.3, we should just use jasmine 2.\n#### Changes\n\nThis allows packages and npm-modules to opt-in to using Jasmine-2.0 for the `application:run-package-specs` command in Atom. Packages opt in by adding `atom-jasmine: \"^2.0.0\"` to the `engines` object in their `package.json`.\n\nCurrently, when using Jasmine 2, `spec-helper` is not loaded. I think it would be nice to eventually stop using the miscellaneous global functions defined in that file. Some of them (e.g. the non-standard `jasmine.advanceClock`) duplicate functionality that is built into jasmine.\n\nI am thinking that some community members might be interested in upgrading individual package's test suites to use Jasmine-2.0. We could make `good-first` issues for doing that in various packages.\n- [x] Make the `AtomReporter` support the jasmine 2 reporter API\n- [x] Make sure `fit`, `fdescribe` et al work w/ jasmine 2\n- [x] Make sure `apm test` works w/ jasmine 2\n#### Questions\n- [ ] This PR also removes the `application:run-all-specs` command. It doesn't seem like that command is used anymore, and it would have been difficult to preserve it while adding support for Jasmine-2.0 in the \n  AtomReporter. Also, it would be very difficult to support that command's functionality if individual packages started to migrate to Jasmine-2.0.\n- [ ] Is the `engines.atom-jasmine` the right way to do this?\n\n/cc @atom/core @atom/non-github-maintainers I'm not sure if it's overly aggressive to get rid of `run-all-specs` command.

Frequently I want to open multiple projects in one editor window, with each project as a root folder. This enables things like tree-view's \"Hide VCS Ignored Files\" to actually work. Other packages also require the root of a repository to be a root folder in tree-view, such as git-blame, for example. Currently, opening a directory from the command line results in opening a new Atom editor window.\n\n``` shell\natom /foo/bar # creates new window with /foo/bar the single root folder in tree-view\natom /foo/baz # creates another window\n```\n\nI have a feeling issue atom/tree-view#393 would block implementing a feature like this, but it would be very nice to support something like the following.\n\n``` shell\natom /foo/bar #
