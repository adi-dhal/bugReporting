Saving something to IndexedDB is actually asynchronous too, but it seems like Chrome/Electron fulfills `put` requests that get executed right during `onbeforeunload`.\n\n/cc: @atom/core \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11646/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11645","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11645/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11645/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11645/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11645","id":151772058,"number":11645,"title":"Editor hangs forever when navigating to the end of a long line","user":{"login":"alexchandel","id":637714,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/637714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel","html_url":"https://github.com/alexchandel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":52925411,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/performance","name":"performance","color":"d4c5f9","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":16,"created_at":"2016-04-29T00:27:09Z","updated_at":"2016-05-05T22:06:19Z","closed_at":"2016-05-05T22:06:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"### Description\n\nWhen the cursor is at column 0 of the line after an extremely long line, and the left arrow key is pressed to move the cursor to the end of that line, Atom freezes forever.\n\nMoreover upon relaunch, it reopens the SAME FILE to the SAME CURSOR POSITION and hangs again, meaning the user is stuck in a permanent hang-restart loop.

If this current PR gets merged, then #8780 would be basically superseded, hence closed, and the actual feature improvement could be discussed and brought forward separately.\n\nAs things are now, the refactoring part in #8780 needs manual updates and conflict resolution everytime the codebase moves further in the squirrel-update area.
