(I always link my package with `--dev` option in order to test the released version when running `atom`) \n\nHowever, [bug reports](https://github.com/abe33/atom-project-palette-finder/issues/16#issuecomment-65506476) started to popup. \nWith some trial and errors I could figure that [despite having `atom-space-pen-views` correctly installed](https://github.com/abe33/atom-project-palette-finder/issues/16#issuecomment-65448631), in their context, running `require 'atom-space-pen-views'` returns an object without the `View` class (and probably many other, I didn't tried to log the keys of the returned object). \n\nI put [some warning in my code](https://github.com/abe33/atom-project-palette-finder/blob/master/lib/project-palette-color-view.coffee#L4-L6) to [confirm that](https://github.com/abe33/atom-project-palette-finder/issues/16#issuecomment-65506476), and as you can see in the logs, the test on `View` existence failed and the warning was triggered (the other errors are irrelevant for that specific issue).\n\nFWIW I asked @jasesmith to provide me with the [`package.json` of the package once installed](https://gist.github.com/jasesmith/3cf91469b2bb1c4282cb) and, compared to [mine](https://gist.github.com/abe33/00dea48ae6f3d8a25cd7), I can't find a significant difference. \nThe thing that puzzles me is that `atom-space-pen-views` is the only dependencies that is not referenced in the `__atomModuleCache` object (while `space-pen` is) but as it works on my computer I doubt it's the reason for these errors.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4393","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4393/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4393/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4393/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/4393","id":50941492,"number":4393,"title":"Move

Currently, you have to check the website for updates and then go to the atom website to download the new Debian package. This is ignoring one of the most useful parts of the debian packaging system, the updater. On Debian, packages are updated (almost) automatically via PPA's (Personal Package Archives) which are hosted for free by Ubuntu at launchpad.net or packages repositories, which you need to host yourself. \n\nA PPA is probably the easiest solution. All you would have to do is upload the Debian package to launchapd.net whenever you upload it to atom's website.\n\nGoogle Chrome also does this nifty thing that is really useful and I think atom should implement as well. You download the Debian package from the Google Chrome website, and the Debian installer automatically adds the package repository to the users system for updates in the future.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need help setting this up I'm happy to help. \n\nIt's free, requires almost no work on your part to set up and maintain, and improves the updating experience on Linux by a lot.

grouping seems to group any editor changes no matter what kind of change it was, which results in confusing/unexpected behaviour.\n1. Create a new file\n2. Paste some text into it\n3. Immediately begin typing\n4. Undo\n\nAtom will group both the pasting and the typing, so the undo removes everything. Ideally it should only remove the typing, with the paste being a separate undo. ST2 has this behaviour and its much nicer. I'll often start typing after pasting some code, and want to undo something I just typed. It's infuriating when the whole lot disappears!\n\nThe same problem happens for many editor commands such as `editor:auto-indent`. Perform an auto indent, then begin typing (or run another command). Undo will revert both.\n\nMy suggestion is that Atom should only group sequences of identical commands. Disparate commands should never be grouped.\n\nAre there cases where grouping disparate commands makes more sense than keeping them separate?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4371","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4371/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4371/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4371/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4371","id":50650081,"number":4371,"title":"New packages not installing Mac","user":{"login":"BillyChick","id":7600704,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7600704?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyChick","html_url":"https://github.com/BillyChick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyChick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyChick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyChick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyChick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyChick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyChick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyChick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyChick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BillyChick/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-12-02T13:25:00Z","updated_at":"2015-01-14T22:54:53Z","closed_at":"2015-01-14T22:54:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi\nI don't know if your aware but new packages, that is packages not already installed, won't install if Xcode has been updated and not used.
