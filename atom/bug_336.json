Installed the package with `rpm -i`, at that time both official package and mine were installed\n4. None on the two Atoms wanted to start, so I deleted both via yum\n5. Re-installed the official RPM package\n\nAfter I've done all that Atom still wouldn't start, neither in normal nor in safe mode.

main problem with upgrading `pathwatcher` is that the semantics of `exists()` have changed from 3.x to 4.x. Previously, it returned a boolean synchronously. In 4.x, `existsSync()` should be used to return a boolean synchronously and `exists()` will return a `Promise` that resolves to a boolean.\n\nHere are PRs to upgrade known uses of `exists()` in the wild in third-party Atom packages:\n\nhttps://github.com/leny/atom-tree-ignore/pull/4\nhttps://github.com/vvakame/language-review/pull/9\nhttps://github.com/m1ga/ti-create/pull/2\nhttps://github.com/rackerlabs/atom-cloud-sync/pull/24\nhttps://github.com/radicaled/dart-tools/pull/20\n\nThough from a cursory look through those PRs, I think it might be possible to upgrade safely without breaking those packages because they seem to pull in their own `pathwatcher` dependencies and instantiate `File` from those rather than operate on a `File` that was created by Atom core. Assuming that is the case, then Atom core could use a different version of `File` than those packages.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5705","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5705/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5705/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5705/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5705","id":58681379,"number":5705,"title":"Opening a file in an existing window shouldn't add a project path","user":{"login":"maxbrunsfeld","id":326587,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/326587?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld","html_url":"https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":163641905,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/atom","name":"atom","color":"f7c6c7","default":false},{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"maxbrunsfeld","id":326587,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/326587?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld","html_url":"https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"assignees":[{"login":"maxbrunsfeld","id":326587,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/326587?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld","html_url":"https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-02-24T01:43:12Z","updated_at":"2015-02-24T20:27:15Z","closed_at":"2015-02-24T20:27:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Right now, if I run `atom some-directory` then `atom another-directory/some-file.txt`, the directory `another-directory` is added to the project as a new root directory.

using the Editor on Windows 8.1, I'm not able to write backslashes and at-signs. Every other application works just fine.\nI'm using a german (QUERTZ) keyboard, so the key combinations are `Alt Gr + Q` for `@` and `Alt Gr + ÃŸ` for `\\`. Interestingly I am still able to write them with the Alt + Numpad combinations (`Alt + 6 + 4` for `@` and `Alt + 9 + 2` for `\\`).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5688/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5687","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5687/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5687/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5687/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5687","id":58565021,"number":5687,"title":"Cursor blinking distracting in the inspector","user":{"login":"silvenon","id":471278,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/471278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/silvenon","html_url":"https://github.com/silvenon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silvenon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silvenon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silvenon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silvenon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silvenon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silvenon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silvenon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silvenon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silvenon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2015-02-23T10:00:59Z","updated_at":"2015-02-23T17:15:46Z","closed_at":"2015-02-23T16:05:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When I open the Atom web inspector, the class `blink-off` is constantly being added and removed as the cursor blinks, which often pushes and pulls everything by one line.
