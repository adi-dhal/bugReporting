This would make reorganizing content more intuitive by giving the user visual aid of what is being moved and where to.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3210/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3209","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3209/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3209/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3209/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3209","id":39893404,"number":3209,"title":"Spawned processes with BufferedProcess don't get killed","user":{"login":"luca-moser","id":1385611,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1385611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-moser","html_url":"https://github.com/luca-moser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-moser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-moser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-moser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-moser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-moser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-moser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-moser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-moser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-moser/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":62363277,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"kevinsawicki","id":671378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/671378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinsawicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"assignees":[{"login":"kevinsawicki","id":671378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/671378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinsawicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true}],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2014-08-09T20:29:51Z","updated_at":"2014-09-30T23:53:26Z","closed_at":"2014-08-12T23:30:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Running Atom 120. \nWindows 8.1 (64bit).\nNode.js v0.10.30\n\nI am using the grunt-runner plugin to run grunt within atom.
