Version 169 has been released and it still is not finding the update. \n\nAny idea why it is not finding the latest version?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4952/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4951","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4951/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4951/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4951/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4951","id":53868274,"number":4951,"title":"Atom crash on load with 'SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input'","user":{"login":"DinisCruz","id":656739,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/656739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DinisCruz","html_url":"https://github.com/DinisCruz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DinisCruz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DinisCruz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DinisCruz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DinisCruz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DinisCruz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DinisCruz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DinisCruz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DinisCruz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DinisCruz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2015-01-09T13:37:54Z","updated_at":"2015-07-28T23:56:59Z","closed_at":"2015-07-28T23:56:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"after installing https://atom.io/packages/git-plus, after Atom rebooted, I got this: \n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/656739/5680373/5c42ea12-9804-11e4-8544-9ff494e59b2f.png)\n\nthe error happened in this line:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/656739/5680379/6f4e3986-9804-11e4-8c22-2d1f5a0b907b.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4951/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4950","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4950/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4950/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4950/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4950","id":53867222,"number":4950,"title":"Add Screenshot support to Markdown editing","user":{"login":"DinisCruz","id":656739,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/656739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DinisCruz","html_url":"https://github.com/DinisCruz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DinisCruz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DinisCruz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DinisCruz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DinisCruz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DinisCruz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DinisCruz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DinisCruz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DinisCruz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DinisCruz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-01-09T13:24:24Z","updated_at":"2017-08-23T21:33:27Z","closed_at":"2017-08-23T21:33:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"One of the best features of the GitHub Issues UI (the one I'm currently writing on),  is the fact that I can just copy and paste images,  from the clipboard directly into an issue body.\n\nIt would be great if (when editing an Markdown file, as shown below) I could also just copy an paste an image.

recognize that extra whitespace is rather unfortunate, but I have to question Atom's solution.  As of right now, the editor removes all unnecessary whitespace like spaces at the ends of lines and spaces on lines without any other content.  However, as I have contributed to several projects, I've gotten questions from the owners of the projects in my Pull requests as to why I unnecessarily adjusted the whitespace. I have to explain that it was my editor.  \n\nPersonally, I understand that code should be clean without these things, but owners can seem somewhat agitated with little whitespace changes alongside the fixes for the actual issue at hand.  I feel like there should at least be some way to disable this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4944/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4943","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4943/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4943/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4943/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4943","id":53838869,"number":4943,"title":"Right mouse click and copy crashing atom","user":{"login":"purencool","id":621875,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/621875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/purencool","html_url":"https://github.com/purencool","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purencool/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purencool/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purencool/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purencool/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purencool/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purencool/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purencool/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purencool/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purencool/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-01-09T06:43:19Z","updated_at":"2015-01-11T21:53:23Z","closed_at":"2015-01-09T12:04:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi all,\n\nI am using ubuntu 14.04 my version of atom is 0.168.0\n\nI am running atom from the command line with atom --safe when I right mouse clicking and press copy it crashes atom.
