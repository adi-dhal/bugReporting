This ambivalence throws Atom into a dilemma when auto-detecting the syntax of a file. I often use Prolog and Perl files at the same time or interchangeably and more often then not files get opened with the wrong syntax highlighting. When opening a file for the first time, that is not an issue: Atom tried to detect the correct syntax, and perhaps it failed - but I can always manually switch to the correct syntax. The problem is that this issue recurs every single time I open a `.pl` file. What I mean is, if for `file-a.pl` Atom guessed Prolog and I change the syntax to Perl, then close the file, and open it again, Atom will - again - guess Prolog. I guess you understand my frustration.\n\nAs I see it there are at least two ways to solve this issue:\n### 1. Remember the syntax per file\n\nAs soon as you open `file-a.pl` Atom could write to a CFG file somewhere that `path/to/file-a.pl` is auto-detected as Prolog. If the user then changes the syntax to Perl, the changes would be made in the CFG file as well. When closing and re-opening the file, Atom would check the CFG file to see if an entry with that file name is present and use the given syntax.\n\nThe downside is that if you are working with a lot of files, this CFG file can grow significantly. Therefore it might be useful to have a check of the CFG at Atom start-up where entries older than e.g. a week are removed from the file, or that the oldest entries are removed when the CFG file reaches a size of > X KB.\n### 2. Improve auto-detection\n\nThis might be the easiest to implement, though I cannot find it in the source after briefly glancing. (I don't have a lot of time, and when I couldn't find it I wrote this post.) In this particular case, it should be easy to distinguish Perl. Often it's right there in the first line:\n\n`#!/usr/bin/perl`\n\nBut doing a regex check on the first line for this specific issue should only be a quick fix. I like the first idea more.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12965","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12965/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12965/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12965/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12965","id":182743880,"number":12965,"title":"Atom 1.12-Beta1 :atom.project.relativizePath behaviour changed.","user":{"login":"gandm","id":2313237,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2313237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gandm","html_url":"https://github.com/gandm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gandm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gandm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gandm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gandm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gandm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gandm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gandm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gandm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gandm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-10-13T09:48:28Z","updated_at":"2016-10-13T13:36:06Z","closed_at":"2016-10-13T13:36:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nIn versions 1.11 and prior a call to atom.project.relativizePath would result in an array with array[0] being the project path and array[1] being the relative file path.\n\nIn version 1.12-beta1 the call returns array[0] null and array[1] the full path/filename.

Open Task Manager and for best results, snap Atom to one side and Task Manager to the other.\n2. Open the Install tab of the settings\n3. Scroll back and forth, quickly without stopping. \n4. Watch the CPU usage in the Atom subprocesses in Task Manager.\n\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]\n\nCPU usage remains steady. About 25% CPU usage max.\n\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\n\nAtom's CPU usage begins to rise to about 50% (for me). Compared to 0% idle.\n### Potential Fix\n\nIn the element inspector, pressing **⋮** > More tools > Rendering settings and checking \"Show scrolling perf issues\" will highlight the scroll container that settings is in as \"Repaints on scroll\".\n\nI Googled it and found this fix: In any container where `overflow: auto` or `overflow: scroll` is (such as `.settings-view .panels .panels-item`, this container), also place `will-change: transform;`. This tells it to use the compositor. \n\nAdding this in the element inspector makes it so it only rises to ~15%. Hell of a lot better.\n\nHowever, if we do that, text rendering gets a bit thicker, so I found it works to decrease the `font-weight` by 100. So `font-weight: normal;` becomes `font-weight: 300`, and `font-weight: bold;` becomes `font-weight: 600;` \n\nI don't have the time to clone Atom, find and fix each and every occurrence of the overflow container at the moment.\n### Versions\n\n```\nC:\\> atom --version\n\nAtom    : 1.11.1  \nElectron: 0.37.8  \nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75  \nNode    : 5.10.0  \n```\n\nWin10 Home Anniversary (x86)\nDell Precision T3400\nCore 2 Duo E7400 @ 2.8GHz\nATI FirePro V4800\n1920x1080 LCD @ 60Hz via VGA\n4GB RAM (3.25 usable)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12949/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12948","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12948/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12948/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12948/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12948","id":182403372,"number":12948,"title":"Shortcut for close file (macOS 10.12)","user":{"login":"pustovalov","id":1568885,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1568885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustovalov","html_url":"https://github.com/pustovalov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustovalov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustovalov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustovalov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustovalov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustovalov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustovalov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustovalov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustovalov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustovalov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-10-11T23:57:33Z","updated_at":"2016-10-12T00:38:46Z","closed_at":"2016-10-12T00:38:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nCan't close new file without saving\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.

Although because rows are 0 indexed, to select the penultimate row for the range it requires using `-2`. \n\nI wonder whether it's worth rewriting the line:\n\n``` coffeescript\nlines += '\\n' unless lines[lines.length - 1] is '\\n'\n```\n\nI've attempted to add a valid test.
