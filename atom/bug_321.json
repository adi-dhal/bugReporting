-1, while the entry should be removed from the search page.\n- Re add the line, in the same file or another file.\n- Result count should now correctly go +1 back to the original count (_nice!_), but the entry is _not_ added to the search page (_sad!_).\n\nI think the best options here would be\n- (**sub optimal**) To not make the result count go +1.\n- (**optimal**) Keep the result count go +1 and add the new result to the search page without having to do a new search. \n\nAdded screenshot showing 3 results in count, but only showing two.\n![screen shot 2015-03-28 at 18 23
