If you have a Yeoman-created project folder i.e. `generator-webapp` created project, run `grunt serve`. It'll create a .tmp file, and I'll assume you haven't had one at first.\n2. When everything goes well expand the folder .tmp in Atom so you can see the subfolders inside.\n3. Stop the grunt process.\n4. Run `grunt serve` again, and it will run `grunt-contrib-clean` to delete .tmp. \n\nIt won't. .tmp will still exist as a \"corrupted file\" and you can't delete it by the Windows Explorer. Command line will show `Warning: Unable to create directory [path to .tmp folder]\" (Error code: EPERM). Use --force to continue.` when trying to create a new .tmp folder.\n\nGo to Atom and try to delete it, and the Dev Tools will show the same error: `Uncaught Error: EPERM, operation not permitted: [path to .tmp folder]`. All you need to do is close the folder again on the sidebar to remove the folder. I also tried the same method to Sublime Text, and it doesn't do the same, so I assume there's a clash between `grunt-contrib-clean` and Atom's way of handling files.\n\nAtom is 0.123.0, and Windows is 8.1. Command line running Grunt is running as Administrator.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3365/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3364","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3364/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3364/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3364/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3364","id":40975712,"number":3364,"title":"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'matchesAttributes' of undefined","user":{"login":"mjonuschat","id":203423,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/203423?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjonuschat","html_url":"https://github.com/mjonuschat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjonuschat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjonuschat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjonuschat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjonuschat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjonuschat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjonuschat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjonuschat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjonuschat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjonuschat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":84710475,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/editor-rendering","name":"editor-rendering","color":"fef2c0","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-08-23T13:33:30Z","updated_at":"2014-08-25T18:55:35Z","closed_at":"2014-08-25T18:55:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Environment: Mac OS X 10.10 DP6\nAtom: Version 0.123.0 (0.123.0)\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

Also, the docs for the displayBuffer are pretty sparse, so I might be misinterpreting what this does.\n\nAnyway, how should I go about changing the width of an individual character?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3358","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3358/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3358/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3358/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3358","id":40944729,"number":3358,"title":"Keybinding to OSX Dvorak-Cmd Qwerty layout incorrect","user":{"login":"AnsonT","id":66660,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/66660?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnsonT","html_url":"https://github.com/AnsonT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnsonT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnsonT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnsonT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnsonT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnsonT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnsonT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnsonT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnsonT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnsonT/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-08-22T19:58:15Z","updated_at":"2014-09-26T04:26:35Z","closed_at":"2014-09-26T04:26:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"In this keyboard layout, the keyboard is mapped to Dvorak layout, but the layout of Cmd-keys are mapped to QWERTY (so Cmd+z/x/c/v etc. are in the same physical location).

For example: \"native!\" means nearly nothing to the newbie, and \"pane:show-item-4\" is not very helpful either.  Suggestion:  Add another column with a functional and meaningful description of the keystroke's actual purpose/function.\n\n2) Grouping/sorting the keystrokes quasi-alphabetical by name (from F11, a, alt-1 through ctrl-\\* and all the way down to up) is not conducive to finding, identifying and learning specific keystrokes.  Suggestion: group the entire page by meaningful (and common) functions, not by keystroke name.\n\n3) If the user has clicked on another tab/buffer in the editor (whether same pane or a split pane, doesn't matter) and then clicks back anywhere on the Keybindings page, the Search Bindings field grabs focus, thus returning the Keybinding page's view to the top-of-page, even if the user has scrolled down a considerable ways into the keybindings listing, and just wants to return to that spot to review something.  Highly distracting and un-friendly.  Suggestion:  Do not let the Search Bindings field grab cursor and focus for click-on-page.\n\n4) The Keybindings page looks to be in about 4-point type, and the page does not respond to window:increase-font-size.  Now, at least some of Atom's enthusiastic adopters (like me) are officially Old Geeks, with eyesight of diminishing returns (blurry, ever lessening acuity), and we really need Larger Font sizes, plus increase/decrease size, everywhere in Atom (and especially here in the Keybindings listing).  Suggestion: perhaps this page (and others?) could be generated on-the-fly from data, with format/rendition controls, rather than being a statically defined/formatted page.\n\nThese are just suggestions... I am willing to pitch in and help on these usability issues (and elsewhere).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3357/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3356","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3356/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3356/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3356/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3356","id":40941383,"number":3356,"title":"Indicate On-or-Off status of Toggle Soft Wrap in View menu","user":{"login":"LorinRicker","id":1362449,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1362449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorinRicker","html_url":"https://github.com/LorinRicker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorinRicker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorinRicker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorinRicker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorinRicker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorinRicker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorinRicker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorinRicker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorinRicker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorinRicker/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-08-22T19:19:40Z","updated_at":"2014-08-22T21:50:09Z","closed_at":"2014-08-22T21:44:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Atom 0.123.0 on Ubuntu/Linux 14.04 (Unity) -- enhancement\n\nThe menu control for a setting like Toggle Soft Wrap should have a visible status-check for On/Off, e.g., a button-dot or a checkmark, beside it in the menu (View for this one), so the user can tell at a glance what that features current setting is...\n\nSoft Wrap should _not_ be a global editor setting, but should be applied on a syntax/file-type basis.

I use this monitor as an extension of my desktop on the laptop. During the day I make Atom fill the entire screen (I snap the window, a feature I have enabled using BetterTouchTool). When I disconnect the external monitor and attempt to use Atom on the laptop's screen it is too large, as if extending off the screen. To find it again I have to click into Atom, go to the top bar, Window -> Zoom. Once I do this it properly fills (again, not fullscreen) the laptop's screen.\n\nAt first you might dismiss this as saying the 3rd party app (BetterTouchTool) is responsible. However, Atom is the only application that this happens to. I also keep Chrome and Outlook in the same - window filled via snap mode on the fullscreen. Both of these apps will extend too far, but the height will be correct and I can again \"grab\" the window by the window title bar.\n\nThus I am led to believe there is something going on with the window settings for Atom, but I don't know enough about this topic to dig any farther.
