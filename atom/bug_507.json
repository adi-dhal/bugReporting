PR bases folds on markers. Previously, folds were tracked in the display buffer with a custom data structure that had a lot of duplication with the marker code. Now, to create and track folds, we create markers with a class of \"fold\" on the buffer. The markers also have a display buffer id so that folds aren't shared between edit sessions for the same buffer.\n\nThis PR also improves marker behavior around undo and redo, ensuring that events are never triggered before the buffer change event is emitted and always restoring the ranges of markers to the state they had before the change being undone / redone. I take advantage of this behavior to restore the selection range around undo/redo automatically, allowing the transaction code in edit session to be simplified.\n- [x] Unify DisplayBuffer's handling of fold creation / destruction with its buffer change handling code.\n- [x] Make it possible to create markers with attributes\n- [x] Make it possible to query for markers based on attributes and other properties such as startRow\n- [x] Make marker API object-oriented (you're currently forced to do everything with the serializable marker id, which is annoying)\n- [x] Base all tracking of fold ranges on markers with the 'fold' class\n- [x] Restore folds when operations that invalidated their markers are undone\n- [x] Restore ability to destroy a fold by clicking on it\n- [x] Ensure that fold markers from one edit session don't result in folds in another edit session\n\n---\n\nFor another pull request:\n- Add invisible folds\n- Allow fold preview lines to be freely edited\n- Allow folds to be copied/cut and pasted\n- Serialize folds across refreshes\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/515","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/515/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/515/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/515/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/515","id":13603753,"number":515,"title":"atom

This will allow for transitive cases, like reloading an ERB file if the SQL grammar is loaded, because the Ruby grammar includes the SQL grammar inside of certain kinds of here-doc strings.\n\n@kevinsawicki This is pretty similar to what we discussed last Thursday evening.
