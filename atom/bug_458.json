thread will document the troubles and solutions to said troubles of building on Mint 16.\n\nMake you sure you have G++ installed. Haven't looked to see if you need a C++11 compliant compiler, but you the repos should have G++4.8.1, which does support most, if not all, of C++11 (think it still needs <regex> implemented>. I'm guessing this does not require C++11 due to the use of typedefs, and the VC++2010 requirements on Windows.\n\nThe npm package out of the repos is version 1.2.x.
