And then I saw the [perldoc package](https://atom.io/packages/perldoc) today, which extracts the documentation from the current file, renders it and views it.\n\nWe should have one API with, most importantly, **one** keybinding to be used to view or preview _any_ file type. So no matter what the active file is, if I hit <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+P</kbd> (for example) the registered viewer for that file type opens up in a new pane. If more than one viewer for that file type is registered, you can select the default one ... or press, for example, <kbd>Shift+Ctrl+Alt+P</kbd> to bring up a viewer list and select one.\n## Requirements\n\n> The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).\n- **MUST** allow packages to register viewers by scope name using the services API\n- **MUST** offer a command `file-viewer:open` to open the single (or default) registered viewer for the file in the active editor (or selected file in the tree-view)\n- **MUST** offer a command `file-viewer:listViewers` to open the list of registered viewers for the file in the active editor (or selected file in the tree-view)\n- **SHOULD** allow the single (or default) registered viewer to be opened for files that do not have an \"opener\" registered, such as image, archive or audio types\n- **OPTIONAL** offer a hex viewer as an option for all file types (see the [hex package](https://atom.io/packages/hex) for an awesome example)\n## Questions\n- When preview tabs are enabled, how should viewer tabs behave?\n  - Should they be preview tabs? Only sticking around permanently if the tab title is double-clicked?\n  - Should they be permanent tabs?\n  - Should they be preview tabs, but of their own class so only other preview tabs override them?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6817/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6816","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6816/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6816/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6816/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6816","id":76852969,"number":6816,"title":"If all windows are closed preferences does not open","user":{"login":"jekriske","id":3432769,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3432769?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jekriske","html_url":"https://github.com/jekriske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jekriske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jekriske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jekriske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jekriske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jekriske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jekriske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jekriske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jekriske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jekriske/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-05-15T20:45:01Z","updated_at":"2015-05-15T20:47:50Z","closed_at":"2015-05-15T20:47:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"under OSX 10.10.3 atom build 0.199.0 if you close all windows then hit atom->preferences the preferences windows does not come up.
