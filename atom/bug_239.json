Levien's [Inconsolata](http://levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html). Inconsolata is unusually small, so it made sense for the default size to be 14pt. However, now that [the default font is Menlo](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/static/text-editor-light.less#L7) with Consolas as the fallback (I guess for Windows) and DejaVu Sans Mono as the second fallback (I assume for Linux), 14pt seems to me to be too large.

The way I did it is very hacky and not production ready but it gets the job done. Right now, if you highlight 5 lines, the first and last lines are their own \"tile\" and all the remaining ones are grouped into a single rectangular tile. Since we want to have each line with a different width, I forced the tile size to 1 and removed the logic that makes it expand all the way.\n\nI'd really like this feature to be in atom, let me know how I can refactor the code to make it shippable.

Create a new Markdown document with the content below\n2. Use mentioned syntax theme and typeface\n3. Notice the color difference between quote 10 and 11\n### Cause\n\nNormally, with my settings, all lines are 21px high, and normal text is rendered with a height of 16px. In the example however, the #-sign, scoped as `markup heading marker gfm`, whose `font-weight: bold` inherited from being a heading, is reset to `font-weight: normal`. This causes the #-sign to be rendered as **17px** high, making the line itself **22px** instead of 21px, and pushing a single pixel outside the tile, causing the entire tile to lose subpixel anti-aliasing. Furthermore, as far as I have been able to deduce, this only happens when the `font-weight` is reset from `bold` to `normal`, although this could be a coincidence of course.\n\nHeads up to @as-cii who I've already discussed this with on Slack. And can someone give me a detective's badge, cause I certainly feel like one! : )\n### Screenshot\n\n![schermafbeelding 2015-09-01 om 15 48 14](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3703530/9605943/e8ab3138-50c0-11e5-9bb2-30ecbdb65a5a.png)\n\nNotice how the tile is 1px higher than the gutter-tile next to it.\n### Sample code\n\n``` markdown\n> Awesome quote 1\n> Awesome quote 2\n> Awesome quote 3\n> Awesome quote 4\n> Awesome quote 5\n> Awesome quote 6\n> Awesome quote 7\n> Awesome quote 8\n> Awesome quote 9\n> Awesome quote 10\n\n# I am a header that's screwing things up\n\n> Awesome quote 11\n```\n### Environment\n\n**Atom**: 1.0.9\n**Theme**: https://atom.io/packages/minimal-syntax\n**Typeface**: https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack\n**font-size**: 14px\n**line-height**: 1.5\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4913","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"B61C:3670:9FDC88:19BBF1F:59D92AAB","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=240>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=238>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"4721b9cc73ff8a86edc955f16b967ada\"","status":"200 OK"}}
