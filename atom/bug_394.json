Taking notes for the upgrade guide\n\nWhile some parts of the API are not 100% finished, I think this is something we should spike on before we declare the API frozen. \n\nYesterday @kevinsawicki was telling me how painful it was converting wrap-guide to the new APIs. He said most of the issue was with `workspaceView` related stuff: we heavily rely on `$.fn.find` in the specs. I dont remember the deets of the rest of the pain, so elaboration would be :+1:. \n\nI think @nathansobo and I should do a couple packages so we feel the pain package authors will feel, and can adjust APIs as necessary, or come up with patterns to ease pain.\n\nAlso, @kevinsawicki I didnt think of it at the time, but there is a forward compatible way to get the element: \n\n``` coffee\nworkspaceElement = atom.workspace.getView(atom.workspace)\n```\n\nThen `workspaceElement.querySelector` is the dude. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3965","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3965/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3965/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3965/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/3965","id":46817951,"number":3965,"title":":memo: fix TextEditor::delete() doc","user":{"login":"brunetton","id":86322,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/86322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunetton","html_url":"https://github.com/brunetton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunetton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunetton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunetton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunetton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunetton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunetton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunetton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunetton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunetton/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-10-25T17:36:18Z","updated_at":"2014-10-27T17:22:17Z","closed_at":"2014-10-27T16:13:05Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/3965","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/3965","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/3965.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/3965.patch"},"body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3965/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3964","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3964/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3964/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3964/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3964","id":46817128,"number":3964,"title":"Atom keeps clogging (crashing) when making use of save-all.","user":{"login":"karloluis","id":4258614,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4258614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karloluis","html_url":"https://github.com/karloluis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karloluis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karloluis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karloluis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karloluis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karloluis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karloluis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karloluis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karloluis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karloluis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2014-10-25T17:00:06Z","updated_at":"2014-10-27T17:12:36Z","closed_at":"2014-10-27T17:12:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"After editing a multiple files (under 2MB) and pressing save-all Atom would crash briefly, depending on the load or extent of the save I guess, but it happens even if the rest are already saved.

am seriously considering to stop using Atom, and abandon all hope on this editor.\n- _It is very volatile, and I am spending more time maintaining Atom than actually coding_\n\n```\nUpdating to

the application menu items no longer worked.\nFixed an issue on Linux where the initial font size was too large on HDPI monitors.\nFixed an issue where the Markdown preview view would stop updating if dragged to another pane.\nFixed an issue where @page directives in SCSS files would not be colorized correctly.\n```\n\nReally Major Changes? Priorities from you guys are totally wrong, if I can't install, update packages I don't care that my Markdown Preview-er does not work properly or SCSS files colorization is incorrect.\n- _Final Thoughts_\n\nProbably will have to switch back to sublime.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3941/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3940","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3940/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3940/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3940/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3940","id":46594467,"number":3940,"title":"syntax highlighting - strings - issue related to `%%`","user":{"login":"colllin","id":185923,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/185923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colllin","html_url":"https://github.com/colllin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colllin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colllin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colllin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colllin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colllin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colllin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colllin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colllin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colllin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-10-23T06:57:31Z","updated_at":"2014-10-24T14:54:56Z","closed_at":"2014-10-24T14:47:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It seems to create multiple nested string syntax highlights... and since my theme uses a semi-transparent background for the string highlights, you can clearly see that they are piling up on top of each other because they get darker and darker throughout the file:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/185923/4749272/8e338880-5a81-11e4-8de2-5cb9d319ff76.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3940/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4758","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"D968:3670:A0B244:19E16BF:59D92CC9","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=395>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=393>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"d91223c9babe97fdd9bd3e407bff076f\"","status":"200 OK"}}
