It's orthogonal to [the Squirrel installer](https://atom.io/download/windows). By randomly installing to the `~/AppData/Local/atom` of the current user, Atom blocks other users from accessing it, defeating the purpose of package management, and preventing users and organizations from deploying Atom on servers or across multiple machines via Chocolatey (I wanted to do exactly this recently).\n\nChanging Atom's Chocolatey package to install a zipfile fixes all of

this immediately after the crash:\nJul 29 15:50:40 ulises-ubuntu acpid: client 9595[0:0] has disconnected\n\nbut in addition .xsession-errors seems to point out to Atom (see below)\n\nIt often, but
