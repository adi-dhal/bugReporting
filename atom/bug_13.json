I'm using a late 2016 MacBook Pro with track pad. The reduction in speed is so noticeable that it's actually possible to scroll your fingers up or down the track pad slowly and Atom will fail to scroll at all.\r\n\r\nI've reproduced this both with all my extensions enabled and in Safe Mode.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I don't know which version of Atom I was on prior to updating to 1.19.3.\r\n\r\nOther apps continue to scroll at the normal pace.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Scroll two fingers slowly up or down the track pad.\r\n2. Atom scrolls the editor window more slowly than it should. When done slowly enough, Atom fails to scroll at all.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nAtom's scroll speed matches that of other applications.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\nAtom scrolls more slowly than other applications.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:**\r\n\r\n100% of the time.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nOS: macOS 10.12.3\r\nAtom    : 1.19.3\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\napm  1.18.4\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.10\r\ngit 2.13.3","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15467/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15466","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15466/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15466/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15466/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15466","id":253179061,"number":15466,"title":"overheating","user":{"login":"CallmeKingsley","id":24882097,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/24882097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallmeKingsley","html_url":"https://github.com/CallmeKingsley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallmeKingsley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallmeKingsley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallmeKingsley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallmeKingsley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallmeKingsley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallmeKingsley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallmeKingsley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallmeKingsley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallmeKingsley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-08-27T17:59:42Z","updated_at":"2017-08-30T18:28:56Z","closed_at":"2017-08-30T18:28:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- \r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

In Atom every file opening, every editing file results in additional fan noise moments and this I have only with e.g Blender 3d when some constant countings are made during editing (constant use of CPU and GPU). I had similar issue with noisy fan or unneeded resources in use when wrong touchpad driver was installed - every scroll using touchpad resulted in additional fan noise. Installing proper driver fixed the issue and I think that there's something with Atom's internal engine to improve.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15462","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15462/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15462/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15462/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15462","id":253153638,"number":15462,"title":"TypeError, Atom crashed and now will not work despite reinstall","user":{"login":"de-Vere","id":27727847,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/27727847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/de-Vere","html_url":"https://github.com/de-Vere","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/de-Vere/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/de-Vere/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/de-Vere/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/de-Vere/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/de-Vere/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/de-Vere/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/de-Vere/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/de-Vere/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/de-Vere/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-08-27T09:56:55Z","updated_at":"2017-08-27T10:48:12Z","closed_at":"2017-08-27T10:00:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"G'day everyone,\r\n\r\nWas doing an assignment in Atom and all of a sudden it crashed, everything went blank and it opened up what appeared to be Chrome Dev Tools or something similar, with the console log and this big long error (copied below).\r\n\r\nI tried exiting out of dev tools and it did nothing, Atom just remained with a completely blank white screen and the title bar up the top, there was no menu folders or anything.

I really want to use atom, but it's not possible without throwing chairs across the room.\r\n\r\nHere is the error I get with a blank white screen where the code, sidebar, etc. used to be:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-08-26 at 5 16 35 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14244783/29746078-e642601c-8a82-11e7-89c8-efa8bfe4b058.png)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15455","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15455/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15455/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15455/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15455","id":253101011,"number":15455,"title":"Improve the Notifications design","user":{"login":"mittalyashu","id":29014463,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/29014463?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mittalyashu","html_url":"https://github.com/mittalyashu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mittalyashu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mittalyashu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mittalyashu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mittalyashu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mittalyashu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mittalyashu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mittalyashu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mittalyashu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mittalyashu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":175213356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/question","name":"question","color":"ededed","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-08-26T15:26:13Z","updated_at":"2017-08-27T09:37:50Z","closed_at":"2017-08-27T09:37:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29014463/29742660-dd59d1ba-8aa0-11e7-90dc-54975c8cc5dc.png)\r\n\r\nThis notification from Atom seems old fashioned.

The specs for my package [css-declaration-sorter-atom](https://github.com/Siilwyn/css-declaration-sorter-atom) suddenly started failing. @Arcanemagus found out that if you place a breakpoint at [main-spec.js#L39](https://github.com/Siilwyn/css-declaration-sorter-atom/blob/68825124d8c312376a4d809995935c1c1390aefb/spec/main-spec.js#L39) then `editor.getGrammar()` shows what you expect, but the `data-grammar` property of [main-spec.js#L9 ](https://github.com/Siilwyn/css-declaration-sorter-atom/blob/68825124d8c312376a4d809995935c1c1390aefb/spec/main-spec.js#L9) hasn't been updated, so the command \"doesn't match\".\r\n\r\nAlthough `editor.GetGrammar()` is showing the expected CSS, the `data-grammar` property of the actual `workspaceElement` is still only `text plain null-grammar`.

See editor's `data-grammar` not being changed\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** `data-grammar` to reflect the currently used grammar.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** `data-grammar` stays the same.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nAtom    : 1.19.3\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15446","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15446/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15446/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15446/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15446","id":253021213,"number":15446,"title":"Use fs-admin instead of runas","user":{"login":"maxbrunsfeld","id":326587,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/326587?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld","html_url":"https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-08-25T21:22:05Z","updated_at":"2017-08-29T17:14:46Z","closed_at":"2017-08-29T17:14:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/15446","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15446","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15446.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15446.patch"},"body":"Now that we're [using](https://github.com/atom/text-buffer/pull/247) `fs-admin` instead of `runas` in `text-buffer`, we can remove the few usages of `runas` in Atom itself and drop it as a dependency entirely, which will slightly reduce our bundle size and the amount of code we have to maintain.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15446/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4218","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507404130","x-github-request-id":"E3D9:366D:3469B6:76CB38:59D92735","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=14>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=12>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"b1ecd04d88b4b2e18834d59c241cd558\"","status":"200 OK"}}
