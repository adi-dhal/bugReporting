reference I've made a package to display all the standalone `atom-text-editor` permutations. https://github.com/atom/atom-text-editor-exercise\n\nCurrently using an `atom-text-editor` in a package as a replacement for `textarea` isnt that great:\n\n``` html\n<atom-text-editor>\n    This editor\n    grows\n</atom-text-editor>\n```\n\nProduces:\n\n![screen shot 2015-02-11 at 12 10 10 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/69169/6155298/f5821de6-b1e6-11e4-9e7d-0e58eb069536.png)\n\nA few issues\n- It shows line numbers by default\n- it shows invisibles if I have them enabled\n- It grows by default\n- The styling is not like the mini editors\n\nConstraining height makes it behave a little more like a text area, but you need to set the height in the `style` attribute or the editor does weird things:\n\n``` html\n<atom-text-editor style=\"height: 100px\">\n  Some text\n</atom-text-editor>\n```\n\nProduces (border added for clarity)\n\n![screen shot 2015-02-11 at 12 14 43 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/69169/6155366/98817a14-b1e7-11e4-81ce-10000d915e8f.png)\n\nAlso not great. It introduces something that is nice in the pane-item editor, but not in a textarea: you cant get close to the bottom of the editor with the cursor, there is always a 3 line padding. \n\n![editor-padding](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/69169/6155421/1c83812c-b1e8-11e4-91ca-8bd62c44999f.gif)\n### Proposal\n\nI propose two new tags:\n- `atom-text-area`: textarea emulation. This would be an editor that\n  - does not show invisibles\n  - does not show the gutter\n  - does not have the 3 line padding \n  - does not grow by default\n  - allows the themes to style the editor as a text area\n- `atom-text-input`: a replacement for the mini editors\n\nThen we could add attributes to enable things\n- `show-gutters` would show the gutter\n- `auto-height` would ignore css sizing\n- `read-only` would set to read only instead of the remove `tabindex` hack \n\nThe markdown preview can just use the `atom-text-editor` to get full code support.

This uses the async `repositoryForDirectory()` API\ninstead of the `createRepositorySync()` API that was used before.\n\nCurrently, `getPaths()` maps a path to a `Directory` asynchronously via the following basic logic:\n\n```\nPromise.resolve(new Directory(path))\n```\n\nBut in a follow up diff, I'll introduce the `DirectoryProvider` described in\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5428, so it will be possible to register a custom handler\nto map special paths, such as `ftp://`.\n\nThis builds on https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5491.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5493","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5493/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5493/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5493/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5493","id":57276952,"number":5493,"title":"Not building on Mac OS X 10.10.2 with io.js","user":{"login":"splodingsocks","id":1227109,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1227109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/splodingsocks","html_url":"https://github.com/splodingsocks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splodingsocks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splodingsocks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splodingsocks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splodingsocks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splodingsocks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splodingsocks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splodingsocks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splodingsocks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splodingsocks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98407029,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/build-error","name":"build-error","color":"f7c6c7","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"kevinsawicki","id":671378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/671378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinsawicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"assignees":[{"login":"kevinsawicki","id":671378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/671378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinsawicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true}],"milestone":null,"comments":20,"created_at":"2015-02-11T05:00:53Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T00:47:01Z","closed_at":"2015-02-19T00:45:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi there!\n\nI'm trying to build on `Mac OS X 10.10.2` from the `0.177.0` tag using `io.js v1.2.0` but I get the following output:\n\n```\n~/g/atom git:tags/v0.177.0 ❯❯❯ script/clean\n~/g/atom git:tags/v0.177.0 ❯❯❯ nvm use iojs\nNow using io.js v1.2.0\n~/g/atom git:tags/v0.177.0 ❯❯❯ script/build\nNode: v1.2.0\nnpm: v2.5.1\nInstalling build modules...\nchild_process: customFds option is deprecated, use stdio instead.\nIn file included from ../src/main.cc:1:\n../node_modules/nan/nan.h:623:19: error: no type named 'ExternalAsciiStringResource' in 'v8::String';

If the creation\nof the `GitRepositoryProvider` were done via the service, this would\nbe a problem because it needs a reference to `atom.project`, which is\nnot defined when it is created. (We work around this because it is\ncreated in `Project`'s constructor, so it can pass `this` to\n`new GitRepositoryProvider()`.)\n\nWe would have to create a `RepositoryProviderFactory` or something if\nwe wanted to specify arguments when creating a `RepositoryProvider`,\nin general. Maybe that's too crazy / not an issue, in practice.\n\nThough note that `GitRepository` cannot access `atom.project` lazily\nbecause it uses it in its constructor to do the following:\n\n```\nif @project?\n  @subscriptions.add @project.eachBuffer (buffer) => @subscribeToBuffer(buffer)\n```\n\nSo long as we can guarantee that `atom.project` is defined before the\nother providers are initialized, I think we should be OK.\n\nFollow-up work:\n- Replace the use of `RepositoryProvider.createRepositorySync()` with\n  `RepositoryProvider.repositoryForDirectory()` in `Project.setPaths()`.\n- Replace all uses of `Project.getRepositories()` with\n  `Project.repositoryForDirectory()` in packages that are bundled with Atom\n  by default.\n- Implement `Directory.exists()` and/or `Directory.existsSync()` and update\n  `git-repositor-provider.coffee`, as appropriate.\n- Eliminate `GitRepositoryProvider.repositoryForDirectory()`'s use of\n  synchronous methods.\n- Somewhat orthogonal to this diff, but the following fields need to be\n  removed from `Project` because they enforce the idea of a single root:\n  `path`, `rootDirectory`, and `repo`. This has implications around the\n  existing use of `@rootDirectory?.off()` and `@destroyRepo()`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5491/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5490","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5490/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5490/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5490/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5490","id":57264709,"number":5490,"title":"Inserting control characters","user":{"login":"xfq","id":2863444,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2863444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xfq","html_url":"https://github.com/xfq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xfq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xfq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xfq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xfq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xfq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xfq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xfq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xfq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xfq/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-02-11T01:26:39Z","updated_at":"2017-06-08T12:42:27Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"To insert a control character:\n- In GNU Emacs, I can precede the combination with `C-q` (`quoted-insert`).\n- In Vim, I can precede the combination with `C-v`.\n- In GNU nano, I can precede the combination with `M-v`.\n\nBut AFAIK there is no way to insert (and display, see #1839) control characters in Atom.

suggested https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/117 to lower the delay for the tooltips of the tabs (already changed). But also:\n\n> Even worse, is that if I jump from tab to tab, it takes another 2+ seconds for the next tooltip to appear. Usually I would expect the next tooltip to show up immediately if I move the cursor through the various tabs.\n\nMight be worth to change it for all tooltips, not just for the tabs. Once a tooltip appears and there is no click, all other tooltips would appear almost instantly (`100s`) until you clicked somewhere. Useful for when you try to get more information of all the available options. Like hovering over all the buttons in Find + Replace.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4809","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"A524:429B:928243:1355B44:59D92C18","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=344>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=342>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"581d9942259a28d69140091e626f015a\"","status":"200 OK"}}
