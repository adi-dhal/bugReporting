So warning\n\nNot sure what to do here. I assume the undefined value is supposed to remove the key from the settings, but I dont know the current state of things. @maxbrunsfeld @nathansobo any insight?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9032/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9031","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9031/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9031/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9031/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9031","id":109550882,"number":9031,"title":"Change event warning and EBUSY error when saving file","user":{"login":"bellmg","id":14945411,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/14945411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bellmg","html_url":"https://github.com/bellmg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bellmg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bellmg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bellmg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bellmg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bellmg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bellmg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bellmg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bellmg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bellmg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":164031126,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/error-from-save","name":"error-from-save","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":211058624,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/uncaught-exception","name":"uncaught-exception","color":"e11d21","default":false},{"id":62363277,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2015-10-02T18:51:08Z","updated_at":"2016-09-29T16:34:58Z","closed_at":"2016-09-29T16:34:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"1.
