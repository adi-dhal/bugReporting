Especially when coming up with a cross-platform application, cross-platform features need to be respected. \n\nAmong other things, `ag` doesn't really work too well on Windows. I would like to suggest switching to [`nak`](https://github.com/gjtorikian/nak) if possible.\n### Advantages\n- Cross platform (you got Node, you got `nak`)\n- Streams results. This is key, I think. Think of how search results populate in through Sublime Text. `ag` (and currently, Atom) just dump a blob of search results. That's a wonky UX.\n- Search results are _in order_. Whereas `ag` returns results like this:  \n      `./vendor/themes/Zenburnesque.tmTheme`  \n      `./vendor/underscore.js`  \n  `nak` knows that you should search and list your current dir, before advancing alphabetically through the subdirs.\n### Disadvantages\n\nOver the last few weeks, `ag` got faster. I shaved 500ms off of `nak` in comparison searches, but it's still about four times slower. Here are some numbers:\n- Searching for the word \"silver\" in all of atom (13300 files) \n  - `ag`: 0.240 seconds\n  - `nak`: 1.516 seconds\n- Searching for the word \"function\" in all of atom (13300 files) \n  - `ag`: 0.602 seconds\n  - `nak`: 1.989s seconds\n- Searching for the letter \"v\" in my dev dir (69329 files) \n  - `ag`: 10.42 seconds\n  - `nak`: 13.37 seconds\n\nCan `nak` be faster? Actually, yes. Since `console.log` is blocking, every time I stream back  a chunk of results I'm holding up the processing. If I drop the streaming results I can improve the speed a little more, but I kind of prefer the stream.\n### Other search-y stuff\n\n`ag` and `nak` both allow for whole word matching, case-sensitivity, non-regexps, _e.t.c._. Atom needs to figure out a way to do these things.\n\nAlso, `nak` supports find _and replace_ in files. You can also filter on the file level, _e.g._, `--ignore *.js` excludes JS files, `--include *.less` only checks LESS files. \n#### More ?!\n\n`nak` can also be used to populate the fuzzy-file list. It takes around 300ms to get all the files in the Atom dir. Unfortunately, that's not in this PR, because I couldn't get it to work properly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/406/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/405","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/405/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/405/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/405/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/405","id":11929757,"number":405,"title":"Atom is unresponsive after opening contributions.scss","user":{"login":"vinbarnes","id":6173,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6173?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinbarnes","html_url":"https://github.com/vinbarnes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinbarnes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinbarnes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinbarnes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinbarnes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinbarnes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinbarnes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinbarnes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinbarnes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinbarnes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":12,"created_at":"2013-03-12T15:36:00Z","updated_at":"2013-03-27T15:34:05Z","closed_at":"2013-03-27T15:34:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Every time I open `app/assets/stylesheets/github/contributions.scss` the app becomes unresponsive -- except I can Quit.

An evolution in the goals and sophistication of computer network intrusions has rendered these approaches insufficient for certain actors. A new class of threats, appropriately dubbed the “Advanced Persistent Threat” (APT), represents well-resourced and trained adversaries that conduct multi-year intrusion campaigns targeting highly sensitive economic, proprietary, or national security information. These adversaries accomplish their goals using advanced tools and techniques designed to defeat most conventional computer network defense mechanisms. Network defense techniques which leverage knowledge about these adversaries can create an intelligence feedback loop, enabling defenders to establish a state of information superiority which decreases the adversary’s likelihood of success with each subsequent intrusion attempt. Using a kill chain model to describe phases of intrusions, mapping adversary kill chain indicators to defender courses of action, identifying patterns that link individual intrusions into broader campaigns, and understanding the iterative nature of intelligence gathering form the basis of intelligence-driven computer network defense\n(CND). Institutionalization of this approach reduces the likelihood of adversary success, informs network defense investment and resource prioritization, and yields relevant metrics of performance and effectiveness. The evolution of advanced persistent threats necessitates an intelligence-based model because in this model the defenders mitigate not just vulnerability, but the threat component of risk, too.\n\n##

Please close it, but I wanted to drop it somewhere for posterity.\n\nMy editor isn't per-project or per-file. It's not something I open up a new instance or window of when I want to edit something.
