Since atom is listing featured packages under the search dialog (when you try to install a new package) it gives an initial impression that the the featured packages listing is the result of your search (if you just type your query without hitting enter). This is very confusing. I would suggest either:\n\na) implementing search while you type functionality\nb) remove the featured packages from the search/install page\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12717","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12717/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12717/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12717/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12717","id":177654440,"number":12717,"title":"Uncaught Error: Cannot read property 'object' of undefined TypeError:","user":{"login":"vantezzen","id":10333196,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10333196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vantezzen","html_url":"https://github.com/vantezzen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vantezzen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vantezzen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vantezzen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vantezzen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vantezzen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vantezzen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vantezzen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vantezzen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vantezzen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-09-18T14:19:33Z","updated_at":"2016-09-18T15:50:02Z","closed_at":"2016-09-18T15:49:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This error happened a little bit after I saved a file\n\n**Atom Version**: 1.10.2\n**Electron Version**: 0.37.8\n**System**: Mac OS X 10.11.5\n**Thrown From**: Atom Core\n### Error\n\nUncaught Error: Cannot read property 'object' of undefined TypeError: Cannot read property 'object' of undefined at ObjectsRegistry.get (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/electron.asar/browser/objects-registry.js:44:28) at EventEmitter.

to close a previously opened init.coffee\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. open init.coffee\n2. Make sure Open empty editor in settings is not checked.\n3. close atom, but don't close the init.coffee tab.\n4. when you open atom again, try and close init.coffee script.\n5. at this point atom crashes immediately. \n### Note\n\nI did solve the issue by opening atom with the `--clear-window-state` flag this loaded an empty atom editor and everything works normally, but when I try to open init.coffee the same behaviour is back.\nAlso, i have nothing in my init.coffee script.\n### Versions\n\natom : 1.10.2\nElectron : 0.37.8\nChrome : 49.0.2623.75\nNode : 5.10.0\napm : 1.12.5\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12716/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12715","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12715/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12715/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12715/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12715","id":177630280,"number":12715,"title":"Improve the \"Save As\" file path","user":{"login":"zacharyrankin","id":321407,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/321407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacharyrankin","html_url":"https://github.com/zacharyrankin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacharyrankin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacharyrankin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacharyrankin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacharyrankin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacharyrankin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacharyrankin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacharyrankin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacharyrankin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacharyrankin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722948,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-review","name":"needs-review","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-09-18T05:20:08Z","updated_at":"2016-09-29T19:44:11Z","closed_at":"2016-09-29T19:44:11Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/12715","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12715","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12715.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12715.patch"},"body":"Currently in Atom when you do a \"Save As\" (or save a new file) it will have a default name of \"Untitled\".\n\nSublime had a feature that would take the first 50 characters of your file and make that the default file name when using \"Save As\".

The indentation is based on the indentation of the previous line (duh), but at the highlighted lines `increaseIndentRegex` may not belong to the scope of that previous line.\n\nFor instance in Blade it's possible to embed a block of PHP in a following manner\n\n``` blade\n@php\necho \"hello world\";\n@endphp\n```\n\nFor sake of simplicity let's say Blade has defined `increaseIndentPattern` is `@php` and `decreaseIndentPattern` is `@endphp` for its scope.\n\nWhen `suggestedIndentForTokenizedLineAtBufferRow` is calculating the indentation for the line containing `echo` statement, then at the highlighted section it looks for the previous line: `@php` and tries to match `increaseIndentPattern` of the current line, which is of different scope (`.source.php`) and is different from Blade's scope, meaning the `increaseIndentPattern` of `@php` is never hit.

But Node cannot be used inside Worker's and this is unlikely to change due to thread safety issues (electron Issue #797).\n\nTwo possible ways around this problem:\n1. Provide a mechanism by which Workers can use the standard loophole, e.g., pre-install 'vm' or equivalent into WorkerGlobalSpace.\n2. Provide a mechanism to redefine the security policy within a package.\n\nBut I'm open to other suggestions, including use of some Atom feature that I haven't found yet.

In the [ink package](https://github.com/JunoLab/atom-ink/), we have a `Console`-class, which extends `PaneItem` and can contain `TextEditor`s as input cells (those are properly registered, I think), but one can't access them via one of the commands above (also see [#75](https://github.com/JunoLab/atom-ink/issues/75) for why this is problematic).\n\nSo either the documentation should clarify that only certain `TextEditor`s will be considered or the implementation should be changed to searching the `TextEditorRegistry` or something like that. \n\nI can have a look at implementing this if you think that'd be a proper

https://github.com/atom/atom-keymap/issues/35\nCloses https://github.com/atom/atom-keymap/issues/34\n\nThis PR includes a new version of `atom-keymap` with changes described in https://github.com/atom/atom-keymap/pull/144.\n\nThe basic idea is that we will never shadow the ability to type an ASCII character with any key binding. Most of this logic is handled in `atom-keymap` and is describe in the above PR.\n\nIn addition to the keymap changes, we are forced to omit keyboard shortcuts for application menu items if there's a possibility they could interfere with typing `AltGraph`-modified characters on international layouts. This means that `alt-` bindings on Mac and `ctrl-alt-` bindings on Windows won't show up in the menu, but the bindings will still work so long as they don't conflict.\n\nI'd appreciate it if international users could give this a try by downloading binaries from the build provider for their platform. You can find links to builds of this PR in the build status section at the bottom of this page, then navigate to the \"artifacts\" section:\n- For Windows, go to AppVeyor artifiacts\n- For Mac, go to Circle artifacts\n- For Linux, go to Travis, where you can find the S3 download URLs in the build log\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12697/reactions","total_count":14,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":11,"confused":0,"heart":1}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4127","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507404130","x-github-request-id":"9337:3670:9F0985:19986FB:59D928A0","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=105>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=103>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"7b6d6a1d9a38884180ac66fa6f9c8bc8\"","status":"200 OK"}}
