 I am writing an atom package in which I define a custom subclass of `TextEditor` and `TextEditorView`.  I have overridden `getViewClass` on my `TextEditor` subclass to return my subclass of `TextEditorView`.\n\nExpected:  When returning an instance of my `TextEditor` subclass from a custom file opener, I expect the view that is created to be my custom subclassed view\n\nActual:  A generic TextEditorView is created instead of my custom subclass\n\nReasoning:  `ViewRegistry::findProvider` does not handle subclassing as expected.  It will match on the first registered model constructor that matches against the provided object, meaning that the`{TextEditor, TextEditorView}` registration is matched because `(MySubclass instanceof TextEditor) == true`\n\nWorkaround:  manually unshift my view provider onto `ViewRegister::providers` so that the search hits it first.\n\n---\n\nWould it make sense to change `ViewRegister::createView` such that the model's getViewClass is checked prior to the `findProvider` flow?  If we did that, IMO it makes for a more understandable behavior when dealing with subclassed models/views.  I'd be happy to work up a patch if, if so.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5127","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5127/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5127/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5127/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5127","id":54677480,"number":5127,"title":"atom
