For some users, this is not the expected behavior when the cursor is in a soft wrapped line -- for those users, a more intuitive behavior would be to cut to the end of the cursor's _buffer_ line.\n\nThis PR adds a new method and command which cuts text to the end of the buffer line. Users can add a new keybinding for that or change the existing keybinding for `editor:cut-to-end-of-line` to point to the new command.\n\nNotes:\n- I decided not to change the current method `TextEditor.cutToEndOfLine` so that it cuts to the end of the buffer line because that would be considered a breaking change for that API. Still, if we consider this to be a bug in that API method, I'd be happy to change that method instead.\n- I decided not to change the current command `editor:cut-to-end-of-line` so that it cuts to the end of the buffer line because that would might surprise users who are relying the current behavior. Also, `editor:select-to-end-of-line` select to the end of the screen line as well, not buffer line, so it made sense to keep these in sync (selecting and cutting to end of line should work with the same line concept so that it's not surprising for users). \n- I decided not to add a new keybinding for this command because it seemed a bit strange to have keybinding for both `editor:cut-to-end-of-line` and `editor:cut-to-end-of-buffer-line`. Normally, users wouldn't use both, they'd use one or the other. \n- I decided not to change the existing keybinding for `editor:cut-to-end-of-line` so that it calls `editor:cut-to-end-of-buffer-line` just so it doesn't surprise users who are used to the existing behavior.\n\nI'm not 100% sure in any of those decisions above. I opened this PR to have a discussion about them -- happy to make changes if anyone feels differently.\n\ncc @thedaniel since you opened that issue https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2607 and @nathansobo @maxbrunsfeld for :thought_balloon: and :eyes:\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8827","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8827/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8827/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8827/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8827","id":107034469,"number":8827,"title":"Global replace needs [Find] and [Replace] (in addition to [Replace All])","user":{"login":"jcalfee","id":204121,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/204121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcalfee","html_url":"https://github.com/jcalfee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcalfee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcalfee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcalfee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcalfee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcalfee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcalfee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcalfee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcalfee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcalfee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true},{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-09-17T17:33:52Z","updated_at":"2015-09-20T01:59:20Z","closed_at":"2015-09-20T01:59:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"In Global search and replace (c+s+f) there only a `Replace All` button ..

Some optimization can, therefore, be applied: skinnier DOM, less stylesheet, and so on.\n**Cons**: building the lines twice has a cost which is higher than the optimizations we tried out. Moreover, we cannot alter the original DOM structure as, otherwise, measurements could be wrong. \n#### Canvas\n\nHave a canvas element and use the `measureText` function to provide all the metrics we need to position visual elements.\n\n**Pros**: measurements happen in a separate context and the overhead is minimal.\n**Cons**: CSS typography is not fully supported (e.g. ligatures/contextual alternates get screwed up) and the risk of reporting corrupted measurements is very high.\n#### No Measurements\n\nInstead of positioning decorations, cursors, etc. with absolute coordinates, embed them inside each line and let the browser figure out all the metrics.\n\n**Pros**: no need for measurements and more semantical HTML. In addition, this enriches the power of styling customizations (e.g. the user has the possibility to style a piece of text surrounded by a decoration).\n**Cons**: worse performance, because the DOM gets more complicated and nesting increases. Overlays need to be displayed on top of lines node, which forces us to employ tricks to let them appear in front of everything. \n## The Present\n\nIn this PR we have implemented DOM-based measurements. The idea here is to append the real lines to the DOM, measure from them, and render everything else that needs measurements. \n\nEvery time `TextEditorElement::pixelPositionForScreenPosition` or `TextEditorElement::screenPositionForPixelPosition` is called, we trigger a reflow (a bit like the DOM does when you try to read from it when its information is stale).\n\nIn `TextEditorPresenter` we update the DOM with all lines we'll need to measure before computing any state, in order to avoid multiple reflows caused by reading from line nodes more than once.\n\nWhat's missing:\n- [x] Autoscroll when reaching the right end of the editor.\n- [x] Implement `screenPositionForPixelPosition` in `LinesYardstick`.\n- [x] Fix remaining specs.\n- [x] Avoid using `NodeIterator` as it is slow. Cache text nodes and measure those instead.\n- [x] Evaluate if caching already computed positions yields some improvements.\n- [x] Remove measurement in `TextEditorComponent::readAfterUpdateSync`.\n- [x] Ensure we have no significant regression performance-wise.\n- [x] Investigate why Hasklig behaves oddly.\n- [x] Fix bug where the cursor disappears when moving it left/right.\n- [x] :arrow_up: autocomplete-plus.\n- [x] :arrow_up: wrap-guide.\n\nFeedback is super welcome and appreciated!
