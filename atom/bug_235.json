No matter how many times I try to save the file in atom, it wouldn't save...\n\nNot using git/version control.\n\nKind of a huge issue. If you need any info, please let me know. It happened randomly. If you need any more logs, please let me know.\n\nAlso, I opened a minified bootstrap.js file with atom in the same workflow and atom was lagging when editing that file. Maybe opening a large file can make a difference?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8750/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8749","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8749/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8749/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8749/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8749","id":105919313,"number":8749,"title":":memo: CompositeDisposable is exported by event-kit, not atom","user":{"login":"BrainCrumbz","id":3185573,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3185573?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrainCrumbz","html_url":"https://github.com/BrainCrumbz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrainCrumbz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrainCrumbz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrainCrumbz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrainCrumbz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrainCrumbz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrainCrumbz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrainCrumbz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrainCrumbz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrainCrumbz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-09-10T23:35:42Z","updated_at":"2015-09-11T07:49:14Z","closed_at":"2015-09-11T02:09:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/8749","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8749","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8749.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8749.patch"},"body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8749/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8748","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8748/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8748/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8748/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8748","id":105906799,"number":8748,"title":"Pressing `ctrl` causes cursor to disappear","user":{"login":"SpainTrain","id":380032,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/380032?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpainTrain","html_url":"https://github.com/SpainTrain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpainTrain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpainTrain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpainTrain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpainTrain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpainTrain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpainTrain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpainTrain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpainTrain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpainTrain/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-09-10T21:59:28Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T19:08:43Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T19:08:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Pressing `ctrl` (by itself or with hotkeys for cut/copy/paste/undo/etc.) causes cursor to disappear.
