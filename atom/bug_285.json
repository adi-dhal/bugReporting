there. I seem to be running into a problem using the atom-script editor, you can see it here: rgbkrk/atom-script#453\n\nBasically, atom-script runs go, which in turn starts up a server. Killing the process with a control-c kills off the child process, but not the child of the child. \n\n```\n13:53|~/go/src/github.com/davewv31/helloworld/helloworld% ps ax | grep helloworld\n84187   ??  S      0:00.22 go run /Users/dave/go/src/github.com/davewv31/helloworld/helloworld/helloworld.go\n84218   ??  S      0:00.22 /var/folders/2v/53vdc3j9187f6zj1ljjfc10h0000gn/T/go-build234219847/command-line-arguments/_obj/exe/helloworld\n```\n\nAfter control-c in atom:\n\n```\n13:53|~/go/src/github.com/davewv31/helloworld/helloworld% ps ax | grep helloworld\n84218   ??  S      0:00.22 /var/folders/2v/53vdc3j9187f6zj1ljjfc10h0000gn/T/go-build234219847/command-line-arguments/_obj/exe/helloworld\n```\n\nIn buffered-process.coffee, the windows and non-windows terminations seem to be different. Windows seems to kill children of children, non-windows seems to just kill the child. \n\n```\n  killProcess: ->\n    @process?.kill()\n    @process = null\n```\n\nSo I guess what this comes down to is what should the expected behavior of BufferedProcess.kill be? It does just wrap child_process, but doesn't allow a full process group kill (which I want) or a signal type to be sent(which I'm not sure would work). \n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7252/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7251","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7251/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7251/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7251/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7251","id":87777099,"number":7251,"title":"Include minimap","user":{"login":"190n","id":7763597,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7763597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/190n","html_url":"https://github.com/190n","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/190n/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/190n/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/190n/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/190n/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/190n/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/190n/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/190n/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/190n/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/190n/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":175213356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/question","name":"question","color":"ededed","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":15,"created_at":"2015-06-12T16:16:17Z","updated_at":"2015-06-29T23:45:32Z","closed_at":"2015-06-29T23:45:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Has anyone ever considered including the [Minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap) package in the core Atom build?

Then, for reasons, I uninstalled the cask version and installed atom from atom.io. Ever since, despite performing \"Install Shell Commands\" and making sure the symlinks are correct, the `atom` command fails to load the current folder. It's highly likely this is isolated to my installation only, but I'm having a hard time figuring out where things go wrong.\n\nI have tried:\n- Removing ~/.atom entirely\n- Exporting a nearly uncustomized `$PATH` before launching atom\n- Atom -> Install Shell Commands (and manually checking the symlinks after)\n- Launching from various folders, just in case there was something weird in the pathname\n\nSo far nothing has worked.\n\nAtom seems to be getting the `--executed-from` argument just fine and with a correct value. For example, if I launch atom in /tmp, I can see the following command with `ps aux | grep -i atom`:\n\n```\n/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/MacOS/Atom --executed-from=/tmp --pid=77617 --path-environment=/Users/redacted/.bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n```\n\nThe launched editor just shows a blank untitled document, does not open the tree view, and Cmd+P says that the project is empty. The `--pid` doesn't point to any existing process but then again I don't really know what it's for anyway.\n\nFile -> Open does work.\n\nAny ideas? I'm on 0.209.0 currently but the issue has persisted for a month or so.\n\nHere's the path to the atom script in case it helps:\n\n```\n➜  /tmp  readlink /usr/local/bin/atom\n/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/atom.sh\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7245/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7244","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7244/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7244/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7244/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7244","id":87627411,"number":7244,"title":"Auto indent keybinding not working after 0.208.0","user":{"login":"0fork","id":1594723,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1594723?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/0fork","html_url":"https://github.com/0fork","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0fork/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0fork/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0fork/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0fork/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0fork/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0fork/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0fork/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0fork/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0fork/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-06-12T06:33:51Z","updated_at":"2015-06-15T05:42:25Z","closed_at":"2015-06-12T17:06:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I had keymap defined for auto indent but it stopped working after 0.208.0.
