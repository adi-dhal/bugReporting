This means you should stop using :host and ::shadow pseudo-selectors, and prepend all your syntax selectors with syntax--. To prevent breakage with existing style sheets, Atom will automatically upgrade the following selectors:\r\n> \r\n> atom-text-editor .search-results .marker .region => atom-text-editor .search-results .syntax--marker .region\r\n> atom-text-editor .search-results .marker.current-result .region => atom-text-editor .search-results .syntax--marker.current-result .region\r\n> Automatic translation of selectors will be removed in a few release cycles to minimize startup time. Please, make sure to upgrade the above selectors as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n#### Screenshot of the deprecation message\r\n![deprecation-screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2272928/23588842/6b95c996-0191-11e7-8ae4-39089d9dbd91.png)\r\n\r\nIf we look at the base template theme on apm, it's using the `.marker` selector (https://github.com/atom/apm/blob/master/templates/theme/styles/base.less#L54) and when the shadow rules were removed from apm, `.marker` was not prepended with `.syntax--` (https://github.com/atom/apm/pull/615/files).\r\n\r\nSo, assuming that apm is actually converting the themes correctly, my guess is that `marker` is not a deprecated selector and should be excluded from the warning messages.\r\n\r\nNote: Based this pr on https://github.com/atom/atom/commit/abef1f25f9101183c7b73eaaf22ea872dd815c3a\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nAll themes that are automatically converted with the official atom \"way\" (using apm) are currently displaying deprecation warnings and also triggering some unnecessary automatic selector translations.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nSee previous item.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nI personally don't know much about the internals of atom. So, the `marked` selector could possibly be deprecated and the solution could lie elsewhere (e.g. on apm).\r\n\r\nI also didn't test this fix at all locally (i didn't find instructions on how to run atom from source, etc). Just traced the deprecation warning message on the source code to this line https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/style-manager.js#L302, which in turn seem to depend on this other one https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/style-manager.js#L275 and from the deprecation message, the only class on the selector that i found blacklisted was `marker`.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nNone that i could find both here and on the apm repo.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13934/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13933","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13933/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13933/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13933/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13933","id":211963182,"number":13933,"title":"Newly added project folder in tree-view disappears after window:reload","user":{"login":"liuderchi","id":4994705,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4994705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuderchi","html_url":"https://github.com/liuderchi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuderchi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuderchi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuderchi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuderchi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuderchi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuderchi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuderchi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuderchi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuderchi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":418477269,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/regression","name":"regression","color":"b60205","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2017-03-05T16:10:11Z","updated_at":"2017-08-31T16:41:22Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

The download URL is toward the end of each Travis CI build log of each build. __Please note:__ Instead of storing AppImage builds temporarily for 14 days each on transfer.sh, you could use GitHub Releases to store the binaries permanently. In this case, delete [this line](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13921/files#diff-354f30a63fb0907d4ad57269548329e3R33) from the `.travis.yml` file.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\n* Flatpak: Requires the setup of Flatpak and a runtime first, need to use the command line. Does not work out-of-the-box on most distributions but Fedora. Does not run on Live CDs.\r\n* Snap: Canonical centric solution, Requires the setup of Snap and a runtime first, does not work out-of-the-box on most distributions but Ubuntu.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nLinux should be a first-class desktop for Atom, and using Atom on Linux should be as easy as on Windows and macOS.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nProviding an [AppImage](http://appimage.org/) would have, among others, these advantages:\r\n- Works for most Linux distributions (including Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE, CentOS, elementaryOS, Linux Mint, and others)\r\n- One app = one file = super simple for users: just download one AppImage file, [make it executable](http://discourse.appimage.org/t/how-to-make-an-appimage-executable/80), and run\r\n- No unpacking or installation necessary\r\n- No root needed\r\n- No system libraries changed\r\n- Just one format for all major distributions\r\n- Works out of the box, no installation of runtimes needed\r\n- Optional desktop integration with `appimaged`\r\n- Optional binary delta updates, e.g., for continuous builds (only download the binary diff) using AppImageUpdate\r\n- Can optionally GPG2-sign your AppImages (inside the file)\r\n\r\n[Here is an overview](https://github.com/probonopd/AppImageKit/wiki/AppImages) of projects that are already distributing upstream-provided, official AppImages.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nNone. Providing an AppImage could be done in addition to providing other types of Linux packages and/or bundles.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13118: Feature request: Provide an AppImage for Atom Stable and Atom Beta releases\r\n* https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4980: Add portable version for Linux\r\n* https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11000: Building Atom Beta releases so they can be installed simultaneously, on the same machine, to stable releases\r\n* https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4330: Installing atom without sudo privileges\r\n* https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2956: Add Linux software repositories for app update support \r\n* https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11837: Flatpak release support\r\n* https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13298: Please provide a snap package","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13921/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13920","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13920/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13920/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13920/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13920","id":211512994,"number":13920,"title":"Freezes any time a minified file is opened.","user":{"login":"viziionary","id":7225068,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7225068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viziionary","html_url":"https://github.com/viziionary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viziionary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viziionary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viziionary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viziionary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viziionary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viziionary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viziionary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viziionary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viziionary/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-03-02T20:49:38Z","updated_at":"2017-03-02T20:51:37Z","closed_at":"2017-03-02T20:51:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm aware of[ this past issue](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/307#issuecomment-110065290) where the issue with big files was apparently fixed but when I accidentally click on minified files of significant size (even small-ish files like basic jquery plugins)  it freezes.

What we realized at the time was that most of the operations happening during startup were redundant and that we could use the information we had at build-time to minimize their cost.\r\n\r\n### V8 snapshots\r\n\r\n[V8 snapshots](https://v8project.blogspot.it/2015/09/custom-startup-snapshots.html) allow Electron applications to execute an arbitrary JavaScript file and output a binary file containing a heap with all the data that's left in memory after running a GC at the end of the provided script.\r\n\r\nThis suits the startup scenario described above perfectly, because we could use it to eagerly perform work when running `script/build` and just expose the computed data to Atom when it is opened.\r\n\r\nThe tricky part of using snapshots is that the code is executed in a bare V8 context, meaning that we have no access to Node/Electron features nor to DOM APIs and we can only run plain JavaScript code without having access to native modules either. So, in order to circumvent this issue, we decided to defer usages of forbidden APIs until runtime so that all the other computation could still happen as part of the snapshot. As a result, we set out to create a tool that automates deferring the usage such features in a way that didn't sacrifice code readability: electron-link.\r\n\r\n### electron-link\r\n\r\n[electron-link](https://github.com/atom/electron-link) is node module that takes a JavaScript file as the entry point and a list of modules that need to be required lazily. Then, starting from the main module, it traverses the entire require graph, replacing all the forbidden requires in each file with a function that will be executed later at runtime. The output of electron-link is a file that can be passed to the `mksnapshot` utility to eventually generate the snapshot blob for use in Electron.\r\n\r\nelectron-link can also determine whether a module can be snapshotted or not. For instance, the following code can be snapshotted:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst path = require('path')\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = function () {\r\n  return path.join('a', 'b', 'c')\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the resulting code would look similar to the following snippet:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet path;\r\nfunction get_path () {\r\n  return path || path = require('path');\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = function () {\r\n  return get_path().join('a', 'b', 'c')\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nConversely, when trying to transform the following code, electron-link will throw an error because it is using a forbidden module at require-time:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst path = require('path')\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = path.join('a', 'b', 'c')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Improving `require` time\r\n\r\nWhile this pull request lays the groundwork for using snapshots for all the concerns described in https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13253, it only speeds up the time we were previously spending in `require` calls. The reason for beginning with just this one feature is that it will allow us to verify the feasibility of snapshots in production and to ship new performance improvements incrementally.\r\n\r\nThe following is a typical chart of Atom startup time:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-03-02 at 12 02 49](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/23504533/348fb306-ff40-11e6-8bac-264060588ce5.png)\r\n\r\n*Please, note that these benchmarks profile everything from startup till the end of packages activation. There is other stuff going on after activating packages but it depends on asynchronous I/O and the scheduling of idle callbacks, so it adds noise to the measurements.*\r\n\r\nOn average it takes `~ 0.9s - 1.0s` to load a stock Atom window and activate its packages when no editor is open and the tree-view is closed. A lot of it is spent in requiring modules and executing them to create classes or define objects. This is how the same chart looks like after this pull request:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-03-02 at 12 01 21](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/23504534/34b323ea-ff40-11e6-8f19-462592b0eb42.png)\r\n\r\nYou can notice how the calls to `require` have almost disappeared (some still need to take place for Node core modules) and how the total time has went down to `~ 0.7s - 0.8s` improving startup time by ~ 15-20%.\r\n\r\nAnother scenario worth of comparison is loading an Atom window with the tree-view opened. This is how it looks like on **master**:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-03-02 at 12 11 24](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/23504869/886dbbb6-ff41-11e6-8d00-63e62857e79b.png)\r\n\r\nYou can see it was `~ 100ms - 120ms` slower and, in part, this is due to loading the package's modules. With the snapshot, on the other hand, we already paid that cost upfront during `script/build` and therefore the chart looks almost the same in terms of time (we still incur some overhead due to accessing the disk synchronously in the tree-view, but that's another story):\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-03-02 at 12 12 14](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/23504870/8891088c-ff41-11e6-9b66-cc2a3c2e9741.png)\r\n\r\nThis kind of improvement should apply to all the bundled packages because they are now required during the snapshotting phase.\r\n\r\n### Caveats\r\n\r\nPlease, note that this pull request disables the asar bundle. Its introduction was mainly driven by two factors:\r\n\r\n1. Lots of file system calls to stat the files.\r\n2. Long path issues on Windows.\r\n\r\nThe former will be automatically addressed by snapshots because most of the fs calls will now happen during `script/build`, whereas the latter was solved by upgrading to npm 3 back in #11897.\r\n\r\nAnother caveat is that all the code that is snapshotted won't be inspectable in the DevTools, although stack traces should still be present and provide clear information about the call site where the error was thrown from.\r\n\r\n### Next steps\r\n\r\nOverall, we are really excited about snapshots and we think we can further improve startup time by performing even more work during `script/build`. This could include eagerly constructing an `AtomEnvironment`, parsing grammars and snippets, loading and parsing less style sheets, etc.\r\n\r\nAlso, before merging this there are a couple of additional tasks that need to be addressed:\r\n\r\n* [x] Merge https://github.com/atom/fs-plus/pull/37.\r\n* [x] Merge https://github.com/atom/node-pathwatcher/pull/119.\r\n* [x] Clean up `shouldExcludeModule` and remove unnecessarily excluded modules.\r\n* [x] Use https://github.com/electron/mksnapshot to generate the snapshot.\r\n* [x] Copy the generated snapshot to the right location on Mac.\r\n* [x] Copy the generated snapshot to the right location on Windows.\r\n* [x] Copy the generated snapshot to the right location on Linux.\r\n* [x] Ensure source maps location translation in stack traces works correctly.\r\n* [x] Fix tests.\r\n* [x] Merge #13940.\r\n* [x] Merge https://github.com/atom/apm/pull/693.\r\n* [x] Merge #13254.\r\n* [x] Test drive!\r\n\r\n/cc:

To save the window state I have to **blur** (click outside) the window, then close it. Reopening the window after blurring it works.\r\n\r\nAccording to the code in `window-event-handler.coffee` the window state should be stored both when a window closes and when blurred:\r\n```coffee\r\nhandleWindowBlur: =>\r\n    @atomEnvironment.storeWindowDimensions()\r\n\r\nhandleWindowBeforeunload: (event) =>\r\n  @atomEnvironment.storeWindowDimensions()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. `atom .` to open project of your choice\r\n2. Resize window, maintain window focus\r\n3. Close window\r\n4. Back to terminal, `atom .` again\r\n\r\nRedo step **1-2** and before closing the window in step **3**, **blur** the window, click your desktop. Then close the window and continue with step **4**, the new window should open with the same dimensions as the window you just closed.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** The window you open in step **4** should be restored to the resized state, when you closed the window.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** The window you open in step **4** is restored back to the state before you resized, in step **2**.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.14.4\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\nmacOS 10.12.3\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI did try to start Atom in safe mode, and also with the `--clear-window-state` flag. Even deleting my `~/.atom/storage`.\r\n\r\nYou can also reload the window and see the same behaviour, instead of closing and re-opening a window. Resize Atom window then reload, watch it reset back to old dimensions, before reload.
