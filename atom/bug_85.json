It turns out the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `production`, which is, I guess, inherited from the Atom process.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Right click on your top folder\r\n2. Click Open Terminal at Root\r\n3. Type `echo %NODE_ENV%`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** `NODE_ENV` is not defined on my machine, so I should actually see `%NODE_ENV%`\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** `production` is printed\r\n\r\n###

contains three longer Javascript scripts, three longer base64 encoded images and two base64 encoded fonts. But everything isn't colourful. I analysed every code and I didn't find any issue. \r\n\r\nIn other code editors, everything works and is colourful.\r\n\r\nI believed that it is a bug. \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. I copied carefully and correctly base64 codes to img and font and it was still colourful.\r\n2. I copied one or two scripts and it was still colourful. But the second script caused the conflict, not allowing me to fold (hide) the Javascript script tags. I switched to another editor, for fixing an issue and copied the third script. \r\n3. I open the same file with Atom and I saw that it wasn't colourful. But still colourful in that other editor. \r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nAtom:                 1.12.5\r\nElectron:            1.3.9\r\nChrome :            52.0.2743.82\r\nNode:                 6.5.0\r\n\r\napm      1.12.9\r\nnpm      3.10.5\r\nnode     4.4.5\r\npython  2.7.12\r\ngit.         2.9.3\r\n\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.10\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2016-11-22 at 05 05 37](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2257024/20514490/49a1bb70-b073-11e6-8e46-7c3ca6033021.png)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13293","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13293/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13293/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13293/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13293","id":190853057,"number":13293,"title":"Add Flatpak support","user":{"login":"mattdangerw","id":1389937,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1389937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdangerw","html_url":"https://github.com/mattdangerw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdangerw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdangerw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdangerw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdangerw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdangerw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdangerw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdangerw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdangerw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdangerw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722948,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-review","name":"needs-review","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-11-21T22:22:45Z","updated_at":"2017-10-02T21:02:00Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/13293","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13293","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13293.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13293.patch"},"body":"This PR adds support for building a [flatpak](http://flatpak.org/) for atom. See the feature request issue https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11837\r\n\r\nFirst time contributing, so please let me know if there is anything else I should do to get this in ship shape. I did not see any tests for other packaging scripts (e.g. create-debian-package.js) so I did not add any here.\r\n\r\nA broader conversation should probably happen around how the library dependencies for the app are included. The build script here will try to download an electron \"base application\" which contains things like gtk and libnotify which are needed by any electron app.\r\n\r\nThis base app can grow with new dependencies of the electron project and contain bug fixes specific to electron. It allows anyone shipping an electron flatpak to avoid library quirks on different linux distributions. It does need to be hosted somewhere though.\r\n\r\nFor now, the flatpak recipe for building the electron base app is here\r\nhttps://github.com/endlessm/electron-flatpak-base-app\r\nand my company [endless computers](https://endlessm.com/) is hosting a compiled version of the base app on s3 here\r\nhttps://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/electron-flatpak.endlessm.com/electron-base-app-master.flatpakref\r\n\r\nIf there is interest, it would be fantastic if atom/electron project could be the official home of the electron base app going forward. We'd be happy to transfer the github repository and help with setting up a place to host the compiled version of the electron base application. Please ping me to discuss further. I can open a follow up issue in the electron repository if that is best.\r\n\r\nOn a related note, have started work on some [node tools for building electron flatpaks](https://www.npmjs.com/~endlessm), and have a few [other](https://github.com/mattdangerw/webtorrent-desktop/tree/flatpak) [app](https://github.com/mattdangerw/brave-browser-laptop/tree/flatpak) [ports](https://github.com/mattdangerw/Ghost-Desktop/tree/flatpak) in progress.\r\n\r\n#### Building\r\nRequires [flatpak > `0.6.13` installed](http://flatpak.org/getting.html). Then just\r\n```\r\n./script/build --create-flatpak\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Testing\r\nInstall the flatpak and run it with\r\n```\r\nflatpak install --user --bundle out/atom-x86_64.flatpak\r\nflatpak run io.atom.Atom\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13293/reactions","total_count":15,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":11,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13292","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13292/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13292/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13292/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13292","id":190845477,"number":13292,"title":"Atom will be unresponsive during the loading of very large files.","user":{"login":"pranshu1992","id":9313077,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/9313077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranshu1992","html_url":"https://github.com/pranshu1992","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranshu1992/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranshu1992/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranshu1992/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranshu1992/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranshu1992/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranshu1992/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranshu1992/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranshu1992/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranshu1992/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-11-21T21:50:18Z","updated_at":"2016-11-21T23:10:28Z","closed_at":"2016-11-21T22:26:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [ ] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\r\n* [ ] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\r\n* [ ] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\r\n* [ ] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\r\n* [ ] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\r\n* [ ] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\r\n\r\nFor more information on how to write a good [bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) or [enhancement request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n[Description of the bug or feature]\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.
