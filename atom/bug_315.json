It is designed to solve a problem that Atom does not have. That is, a set of CSS rules to normalize presentation across all browsers that may be used for rendering, using whatever browser-specific hacks necessary to achieve that goal.\n\nThe project was also conceived before the advent of flexbox, which means that bootstrap has a ton of cruft to deal with pre-flexbox browsers. Such workarounds are verbose and make it difficult to understand what can be removed.\n\nIn sum, this puts Atom into a situation where:\n- The CSS is much larger than what Atom needs.\n- It requires much more work than should be necessary to understand why the current CSS works the way it does.\n- Bootstrap is the source of truth, rather than something that is directly under Atom's control.\n\nFor example, take a look at the issue I recently filed against Bootstrap: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/16276. The recommended solution is to pile on another hack (i.e., use an even more specific CSS selector) rather than figure out why the existing CSS works the way it does and fix the underlying problem with the model. Presumably this is because trying to untangle why things work the way they do is too hard.\n\nAtom should not be saddled with the baggage of layout engines of old and should be exploiting the fact that it only needs to support Blink (which supports flexbox), and write its own small, specific, and far more maintainable CSS.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6350","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6350/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6350/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6350/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6350","id":67957213,"number":6350,"title":"Failed to activate the gulp-control package","user":{"login":"MicahZoltu","id":886059,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/886059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MicahZoltu","html_url":"https://github.com/MicahZoltu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MicahZoltu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MicahZoltu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MicahZoltu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MicahZoltu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MicahZoltu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MicahZoltu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MicahZoltu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MicahZoltu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MicahZoltu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-04-12T20:57:28Z","updated_at":"2015-04-12T21:17:00Z","closed_at":"2015-04-12T21:17:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[Enter steps to reproduce below:]\n1. `set ATOM_HOME=%APPDATA%\\Atom`\n2. `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\atom\\bin\\apm link --dev`\n3.

This would be fine, except that it does so even if you have a hardware/bluetooth keyboard attached. I'm not sure if Windows provides a way to tell if there is a physical keyboard attached, but if not, could you provide an option to not open the software keyboard ever? \n\nThe other issue is with scrolling. With apps designed for touch screens, you can drag down from the top of the editor and it scrolls down. However this doesn't seem to work with atom, and you have to grab the very thin scrollbar on the side on order to scroll down. Would it be possible to allow drag-scrolling?\n\nThanks so much, I love the editor!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6336/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6335","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6335/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6335/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6335/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6335","id":67703968,"number":6335,"title":"Links do not work in v189+","user":{"login":"jravetch","id":316190,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/316190?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jravetch","html_url":"https://github.com/jravetch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jravetch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jravetch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jravetch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jravetch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jravetch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jravetch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jravetch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jravetch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jravetch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":97577987,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/linux","name":"linux","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":15,"created_at":"2015-04-10T23:37:35Z","updated_at":"2015-09-08T15:41:25Z","closed_at":"2015-09-08T15:41:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"After upgrading to Atom 189, links no longer open a new tab in Chrome.

particular in a native text field (OS X anyway) I can use Up/Down to move or select to the start/end of my text field. These keybindings/commands ARE properly implemented in the standard TextEditor, it just looks like they've been intentionally left out of the mini editor. In particular if you look in `text-editor-element.coffee` you'll see:\n\n```\natom.commands.add 'atom-text-editor:not([mini])', stopEventPropagation(\n  'core:move-up': -> @moveUp()\n  'core:move-down': -> @moveDown()\n  'core:move-to-top': -> @moveToTop()\n  'core:move-to-bottom': -> @moveToBottom()\n...\n```\n\nI think the following commands should be included in the mini editor to match native behavior:\n\n```\n  'core:move-up': -> @moveUp()\n  'core:move-down': -> @moveDown()\n  'core:move-to-top': -> @moveToTop()\n  'core:move-to-bottom': -> @moveToBottom()\n  'core:select-up': -> @selectUp()\n  'core:select-down': -> @selectDown()\n  'core:select-to-top': -> @selectToTop()\n  'core:select-to-bottom': -> @selectToBottom()\n```\n\nDoes this seem like a reasonable change? If so I can make a pull request, just asking first since these seem to have been explicitly disabled in the mini editor.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6329/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6328","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6328/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6328/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6328/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6328","id":67583919,"number":6328,"title":"Crash
