PR changes our approach to text editor rendering by centralizing all state in a `TextEditorPresenter` object that sits between the view and the model.\n\n![presenter diagram](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1789/5943048/d3ef770a-a6d8-11e4-9ed7-aa4ce2a650f2.png)\n\nThe presenter manages a mutable state object that is synchronously updated whenever there are changes from the model or changes to measurements from the view. The view consumes this state object when updating the DOM asynchronously so we don't need to recompute it before every render like we do now.\n\nThis reconfiguration paves the way to perform all DOM updates manually rather than relying on React's virtual DOM reconciliation system. The view will maintain a copy of the presenter state, and it will perform a comparison of the presenter's state against the copy when updating the DOM.\n\nThe net result will be a design very similar to React's reconciliation mechanism, but my hope is that a lower-level implementation targeting our specific problem domain will make this design easier to profile and open up specific optimizations that wouldn't be possible at a higher level of abstraction. We already perform DOM updates to lines and line numbers manually to optimize around reconciliation overhead; this would just complete that process.\n## Remaining work\n### Optimizations\n- [x] Perform a single decorations query when the visible row range changes to cache the visible decorations, then read decoration classes from that when building lines, line numbers, etc rather than querying multiple times on every change.\n- [x] When decorations are added / removed, update only the decoration classes on lines and line numbers rather than doing a full pass on their content.\n- [x] Cache `foldable` status for each line in the tokenized buffer instead of recomputing it every time we update the line numbers.\n### Fixes\n- [x] Fix velocity scrolling upward\n- [x] Fix TextEditorComponent specs\n- [x] Compute row id correctly when the first visible line is soft-wrapped.\n- [x] Eliminate `TextEditorPresenter::getHeight`\n- [x] Audit handling of scrollTop/scrollLeft\n- [x] Enforce maximum scrollTop/Left based on height/width and content. This should hopefully address some flakiness in the random test.\n- [x] Editor losing focus when switching grammars with grammar switcher. Does that happen on master too?\n- [x] Gutter background color isn't changing when themes get changed.\n- [x] Switching syntax themes is super slow\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5292","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5292/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5292/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5292/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5292","id":55771052,"number":5292,"title":"Uncaught

It looks like atom is moving away from having a single project root directory (as described in  #3691).  Does this mean that packages should define and track a project root themselves, if needed?\n2. The deprecation cop says to use TextEditorElement::pixelPositionForBufferPosition, instead of the same function on the editor model.  I see that editor.displayBuffer appears to be the indicated TextEditorElement, however, there is no apparent accessor for it; is it a part of the public API?\n\nThanks\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4802","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"E75E:3670:A071A8:19D6E71:59D92C30","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=351>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=349>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"735fa07e9ff547b34022cdeb3eef2532\"","status":"200 OK"}}
