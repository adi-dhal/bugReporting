Fuck.\n\nAnyway, this thing is fucking great. Docs are written in the standard \"JavaDoc/JSDoc\" notation of using `@`-tags to represent information, but most everything else is interpreted from code. You can get a JSON representation of code; for methods, that looks something like this (truncated for brevity):\n\n```\nparameters: [ [Object], [Object], [Object], [Object] ],\n    doc: \n     { node: [Object],\n       options: [Object],\n       examples: [Object],\n       params: [Object],\n       comment: '<p>Run the documentation generator. This is usually done through\\nthe command line utility <code>codo</code> that is provided by this package.</p><p>You can also run the documentation generation without writing files\\nto the file system, by supplying a callback function.</p>',\n       summary: 'Run the documentation generator.' },\n```\n\nJSON representation can be used to do, for example, fuzzy-search or autocompletion.\n\nAt the end of the parse, you can get something that looks like this:\n\n```\nParsed files:           25\nClasses:                21 (1 undocumented)\nMixins:                  4\nNon-Class files:         1\nMethods:               137 (0 undocumented)\nConstants:               3 (0 undocumented)\n 99.38% documented\n```\n\nThis is awesome, because, like code coverage tests, docs can shoot for \"90% and above\" API documentation. Don't want something doc'ed? Fine, mark it as `@private` and you're off scott free.\n\nThere are a few things I would want to add, such as stricter detection for types ( _i.e._ a parameter of type `Stirng` would be wrong; linking to a class/method that does not exist is wrong), but by and large codo has everything a proper API generation tool needs. Fuck docco.\n#### Serious stuff\n\nThe difficult part for me is arranging what's actually relevant, public information; meaning, like, Coffeescript doesn't have `$` prefixes for function names, typically indicating utility or unexposed functions. Which methods are the most absolute important to get done first?\n\nOn top of that, I worry about _which_ code is going to change, for example, with node-webkit bindings.\n\nSo, what would be helpful for me to get started is like a basic list of \"important shit.\" Based on class names I can probably guess the starting points: Editor, EditSession, Range--all super important. What might be good also for everyone is just to come up with [an ERD, as was done for Ace](http://ace.ajax.org/doc/template/resources/images/Ace_ERD.png).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/221","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/221/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/221/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/221/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/221","id":10523409,"number":221,"title":"Creating GitHub_Dark and GitHub_Light.","user":{"login":"jonrohan","id":54012,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/54012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonrohan","html_url":"https://github.com/jonrohan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonrohan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonrohan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonrohan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonrohan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonrohan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonrohan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonrohan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonrohan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonrohan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":16,"created_at":"2013-02-01T00:03:07Z","updated_at":"2014-06-15T19:39:58Z","closed_at":"2013-02-01T21:53:20Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/221","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/221","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/221.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/221.patch"},"body":"This base is right now stolen from Twilight/IR_White.

I'm not super particular on what the bindings are, but I think the current ones should go. I think Vim's `ctrl-w s` and `ctrl-w v` bindings would be good to have, but I know it's important to @defunkt to limit window manipulation bindings to a single keystroke. Ideas?
