There are many tools on the market that allow git interaction without the command line (GitHub for Windows and Visual Studio to name a couple big ones) so not all users have git.exe installed.  For those that do have it insalled, they may be interacting with it through a front-end (git extensions) so they may not have git on the path and/or setup to work from the command line.\n\nFor such users, publishing is a bit of a headache.

I see the same error if I open base-minimal project in VS Studio Express and trigger a build.\n\nI tried building an older version of Atom (e.g. Atom 0.192.0), and that took me past building apm and past installing packages, all the way to [this error](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6415). But that's another problem, and makes me believe this problem was introduced after 0.192.0. Also, I just tried cloning https://github.com/atom/node-chromium-pickle to a folder closer to the root and running `npm install` in that folder and that worked just fine -- no long file name problems.\n\nAnyone else seeing the problem above when building the latest master on Windows?  /cc @kevinsawicki @zcbenz @paulcbetts Perhaps somehow related to https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/6313?\n\nPossible cause of problems: that path above which is reported as too long looks very suspicious as well. Notice the duplicated `base\\third_party\\dynamic_annotations` part in the path near the end. As far as I can tell, that's happening [here](https://github.com/zcbenz/base-minimal/blob/383005fc9673e8f603cffc7ae653a74d160f9d07/src/base/third_party/dynamic_annotations/dynamic_annotations.c#L38). Notice that `dynamic_annotations.h` and `dynamic_annotations.c` are actually in the same folder. After I changed that line from:\n\n```\n#include \"base/third_party/dynamic_annotations/dynamic_annotations.h\"\n```\n\nto\n\n```\n#include \"dynamic_annotations.h\"\n```\n\nI was able to build chromium-pickle without the long file name problems.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6436/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6435","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6435/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6435/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6435/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6435","id":69402027,"number":6435,"title":"Unicode chars broken","user":{"login":"rumpelsepp","id":1961699,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1961699?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumpelsepp","html_url":"https://github.com/rumpelsepp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumpelsepp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumpelsepp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumpelsepp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumpelsepp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumpelsepp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumpelsepp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumpelsepp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumpelsepp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumpelsepp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-04-19T08:56:34Z","updated_at":"2015-04-19T15:07:37Z","closed_at":"2015-04-19T15:07:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"In recent atom releases I have massive problems with unicode chars.

#5771\n\nWhen we change config values rapidly, we end up detecting our own changes to the user config file, causing a load to be requested. If we have made changes to the config since the last write that haven't yet been saved, our changes end up getting clobbered when the stale values are loaded. My simple solution is to just never load values from disk when there are unsaved changes pending.\n\nThis is actually a pretty nuanced problem to get right in the general case, and reminds me of the kinds of problems databases deal with. The sync API backed by async persistence is especially tricky.

I think it would also be useful to have a 'popover' panel layer. This would be an absolutely positioned layer above all other window content (except modal panel layer). Panels are absolute positioned within it. Benefits include:\n1. A standard place (using existing panel API) for inserting overlay elements. Now it seems the common practice is for packages to insert popover UI arbitrarily into the DOM.\n2. Support more use cases then TextEditor 'overlay' decorations, because the popover panel layer would allow popovers anywhere in the Atom window, not just within a text editor. This layer might also be a place to solve https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5469.\n3. Optionally implement popover layout logic once instead of having each package implement it badly once. Popover layout logic is somewhat complex since generally popovers want to be positioned relative to an existing element while also not being clipped by screen edges.\n\nThis pull request is a minimal start. It defines the popover layer and API for adding panels. But it doesn't perform any positioning logic. Assuming people like this idea I would also like to add positioning options and logic with the basic goal being:\n1. Uses should be able to position panel at arbitrary position on screen\n2. Or users should be able to position panel relative to an existing element on screen similar to Cocoa's [NSPopover](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/AppKit/Reference/NSPopover_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSPopover/showRelativeToRect:ofView:preferredEdge:).\n\nThoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6419/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6418","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6418/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6418/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6418/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6418","id":69150373,"number":6418,"title":"Large lines causing horizontal scroll turns editor unresponsive","user":{"login":"nokrosis","id":130460,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/130460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokrosis","html_url":"https://github.com/nokrosis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokrosis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokrosis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokrosis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokrosis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokrosis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokrosis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokrosis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokrosis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nokrosis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-04-17T14:31:56Z","updated_at":"2015-04-17T14:36:07Z","closed_at":"2015-04-17T14:33:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Pasting or opening a file with the following code, turns the editor unresponsive.\n\n``` html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    _characterList =  {\"R01-S01-T01\":[{\"id\":\"Chloe Flower\",\"name\":\"Chloe Flower\",\"imageUrl\":\"/media/5801/SPKS2_PNGs_FRUIT__VEG_Chloe-Flower.png\",\"bio\":\"A bit of a hippy, I'm all about 'Flower Power' but I'm loyal to the end!

I haven’t found out why that is or how to fix it:\n![atom sidebar](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/925062/7202151/e91efc70-e50f-11e4-8d34-c2545807470f.png)\n- 3rdparty is a git submodule – perfectly searchable\n- .git and .idea are hidden folders, not searchable – also fine\n- apps is also a normal folder with a few differences:\n  - most of the subfolders are separate git clones of apps – they are grey and none of them are searchable\n  - even the subfolders which are not git clones, there by default and not greyed out are _not_ searchable\n  - the folder is owned by my user but by the webserver group – that’s not a problem for another folder though where stuff is searchable\n\nDigging further it might have something to do with the .gitignore? [Our .gitignore](https://github.com/owncloud/core/blob/master/.gitignore) has this part:\n\n```\n# ignore all apps except core ones\n/apps*/*\n!/apps/files\n!/apps/files_encryption\n!/apps/encryption\n!/apps/encryption_dummy\n!/apps/files_external\n!/apps/files_sharing\n!/apps/files_trashbin\n!/apps/files_versions\n!/apps/user_ldap\n!/apps/user_webdavauth\n!apps/provisioning_api\n```\n\nSo that might be a factor. However as I said above\n\n> even the subfolders which are not git clones, there by default and not greyed out are _not_ searchable\n\nAnd as you can see, these are also un-ignored in the .gitignore. Maybe that isn’t correctly parsed?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4840","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"DDF2:366E:705C2A:ECBA6A:59D92BAD","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=313>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=311>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"0a52f2daa9637d26d06b703619386065\"","status":"200 OK"}}
