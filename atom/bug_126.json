window to view the underlying editor.  However, maximizing the window causes the same behavior, which I think is unexpected.  Could a better solution be to add a toggle button for the editor?\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. `window:run-package-specs`\n2. Maximize the window\n\n**Expected behavior:** Spec window to visually remain the same as the un-maximized version\n\n**Actual behavior:** Editor appears\n### Versions\n\n```\nAtom    : 1.10.0-dev-9705b3d\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\n```\n\n```\napm  1.10.0\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.11\ngit 2.8.3.windows.1\nvisual studio\n```\n\nWindows 10 x64.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12046","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12046/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12046/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12046/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12046","id":162297148,"number":12046,"title":"Spec stacktrace cut off","user":{"login":"50Wliu","id":2766036,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2766036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu","html_url":"https://github.com/50Wliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false},{"id":193722981,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/ui","name":"ui","color":"99cc00","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-06-25T20:01:41Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T19:11:15Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T19:11:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nWhen running specs through the UI, the stacktraces have the potential to be cut off, like so:\n![spec-stacktrace-cut-off](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2766036/16358793/4dfee28e-3aed-11e6-9503-73f08a737efa.png)\nIn that picture the column number isn't visible.  In more extreme cases the line number or even parts of the filename can be cut off as well.\n(the stark white/black contrast also looks really ugly)\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Have a sufficiently long directory structure to where the specs are located\n2. Purposely create a failing test\n3. `window:run-package-specs`\n\n**Expected behavior:** Being able to view the entire stack trace without having to resize the window (maybe by clicking on the stack trace)\n\n**Actual behavior:** Stack trace is cut off at the end\n### Versions\n\n```\nAtom    : 1.10.0-dev-9705b3d\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\n```\n\n```\napm

on a file in some general directory, Atom complains bitterly every time I save something because there's not a `package.json` file. Most of the things I'm working on are text files or personal bits of code that are never going to see a package manager or somebody else's computer and have no need for version or dependency information. While I appreciate Atom's ability to access and utilize the package information, I don't think it's appropriate that it assumes that I need a `package.json` file in every single directory. The dev tools console should only pop up when there's an _actual_ error.\n### Versions\n\n```\nWindows 10\nAtom 1.8.0\napm  1.9.2\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.11\ngit 2.8.2.windows.1\nvisual studio 2015\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12042/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12041","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12041/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12041/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12041/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12041","id":162167921,"number":12041,"title":"Invisible characters break ruby code","user":{"login":"h-salazaro","id":20116975,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/20116975?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/h-salazaro","html_url":"https://github.com/h-salazaro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h-salazaro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h-salazaro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h-salazaro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h-salazaro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h-salazaro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h-salazaro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h-salazaro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h-salazaro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h-salazaro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-06-24T15:09:13Z","updated_at":"2016-12-15T16:09:03Z","closed_at":"2016-12-15T16:09:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\n\nI love Atom interface and functionality, but sometimes it creates an invisible character that breaks my code.
