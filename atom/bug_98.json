Although this introduced many benefits, it carried several tradeoffs too.\r\n\r\nIn particular, we started duplicating some of the style sheets (`{context: 'atom-text-editor'}`) inside each shadow root so that package and theme authors could still be able to explicitly target the editor visual elements. An alternative solution to this problem that we suggested (before the shadow DOM spec was finalized) was to use `/deep/` and `::shadow` pseudo selectors, which unfortunately are now [being deprecated](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=489954).\r\n\r\nEven more importantly, this architecture was getting in the way of making `atom-text-editor` a reusable component, because it made it even more coupled to Atom and its ecosystem. Other problems involved things like #4590, and a more complex user experience for package and theme authors in general. Ultimately, we started feeling like the extra complexity of the shadow DOM wasn't worth its benefits.\r\n### Removing shadow DOM from `atom-text-editor`\r\n\r\nThis pull request aims at removing the shadow DOM in a way that prevents elements within `atom-text-editor` that we don't fully control (i.e. the grammar scopes applied as CSS classes to every line's inner `<span>`) from being mistakenly styled from the outside. Specifically, every syntactic class name will now be prepended with `syntax--`; styling a JavaScript operator, for example, should now look like the following:\r\n\r\n``` css\r\n.syntax--source.syntax--js .syntax--operator {\r\n  color: green;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven the wide scope of this change, we are trying to reduce package breakage to a minimum by [transforming deprecated selectors automatically](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/as-deprecate-shadow-dom/src/style-manager.js#L251-L306) and emitting a deprecation in [deprecation-cop](https://github.com/atom/deprecation-cop). Applying these transformations can be quite onerous and therefore we have introduced a layer of caching in 07d56b2 to ensure their performance impact stays low after the first time Atom is launched. \r\n\r\nOther notable changes include:\r\n- Block decorations rendering has been rewritten from scratch (it previously worked only with the shadow DOM).\r\n- When the editor is focused, `document.activeElement` will now return the hidden `<input>` inside `atom-text-editor`, instead of `atom-text-editor` itself. I could find only one third party package relying on this behavior, and I am going to submit a pull request shortly to use `document.activeElement.closest('atom-text-editor')` instead.\r\n- Any Grim or style sheet deprecation will now cause specs to fail, see [`ensureNoDeprecatedFunctionCalls`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/as-deprecate-shadow-dom/spec/spec-helper.coffee#L121) and [`ensureNoDeprecatedStylesheets`](ensureNoDeprecatedStylesheets).\r\n- Rendering flashes for decorations has been broken for a long time, but removing the shadow DOM highlighted the cause of the issue, and so they have been fixed in 1091b0e.\r\n  \r\n  ![flash](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/19191430/b0e90580-8ca2-11e6-8272-c2d47fa4c8e5.gif)\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nRemoving the shadow DOM is an important step for the editor's future, as doing so will allow us to extract it, clean it up and optimize it. Considering the invasive nature of this change, we are planning to :ship: it after rolling the railcars next week, so that everyone can build it from master and extensively test it for an entire release cycle.\r\n\r\nBefore merging this, we will also need to merge the following core package pull requests, so that we stop using any deprecated API or selector, and make the test suite green

This was partially addressed in https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus/pull/782, which disables symbol indexing for large files.

resizing the pane, the highlight will _visually_ be in the incorrect position, but it still is actually where the original highlight was.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. The easiest way to reproduce this is by creating a new pane, such as through Markdown Preview, though simply splitting the current pane works as well.\n2. Open a `.md` file.\n3. Highlight some text\n4. `markdown-preview:toggle`\n5. The text should still be highlighted at this point\n6. `markdown-preview:toggle`\n7. ?!\n8. You can verify that the highlight is still in the correct place through a variety of ways: using the arrow keys to move the cursor, cutting the highlighted text, etc.\n\n![incorrect-selection-on-pane-resize](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2766036/19156576/5ffa4bb8-8bb0-11e6-9dbc-1b7ab4ea60c6.gif)\n\n**Expected behavior:** The highlight to visually stay in the correct place.\n\n**Actual behavior:** The highlight moves! :ghost:\n### Versions\n\nYou can get this information from executing `atom --version` and `apm --version` at the command line.

cannot be disabled - or more clearly, the checkbox that is on by default can be unselected, but the effect of cursor skipping over soft tabs does not change.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Ensure that \"soft tabs\" and \"show invisibles\" settings are on, and Tab Type is set to auto/soft.\n2. Create a new file, and press the tab key to indent.\n3. Observe that 4 \"dots\" appear to represent the tab as four spaces, i.e. a soft tab.\n4. move the cursor using the keyboard, and observe if the cursor skips over the spaces as a whole, or allows the cursor to move over each space one by one. Also try and select a middle space using the mouse cursor.\n\n**Expected behavior:** with the 'Atomic Soft Tabs' setting off, I would expect the cursor to be able to select spaces within a soft tab.\n\n**Actual behavior:** the cursor skips over all the spaces, i.e. Atomic Soft Tab behaviour.\n### Versions\n\nRHEL7.2\n\n$ atom --version\nAtom    : 1.10.2\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\n\n$ apm --version\napm  1.12.5\nnpm  3.10.5\nnode 4.4.5\npython 2.7.5\ngit 1.8.3.1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12884/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12883","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12883/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12883/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12883/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12883","id":181238808,"number":12883,"title":"Always return Disposable from maintain{Config,Grammar}","user":{"login":"maxbrunsfeld","id":326587,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/326587?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld","html_url":"https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-10-05T19:04:17Z","updated_at":"2016-10-05T19:49:02Z","closed_at":"2016-10-05T19:49:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/12883","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12883","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12883.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12883.patch"},"body":"Fixes https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/377\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12883/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12882","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12882/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12882/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12882/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12882","id":181206504,"number":12882,"title":"Uncaught Error: Cannot read property 'object' of undefinedTypeError: Cannot read property 'objec...","user":{"login":"MarcinWieczorek","id":3466984,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3466984?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcinWieczorek","html_url":"https://github.com/MarcinWieczorek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcinWieczorek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcinWieczorek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcinWieczorek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcinWieczorek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcinWieczorek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcinWieczorek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcinWieczorek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcinWieczorek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcinWieczorek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-10-05T16:41:22Z","updated_at":"2016-10-05T18:16:58Z","closed_at":"2016-10-05T16:44:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I don't know how I caused this, I was editing a bash script.

Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nWhen the file matches the VCS ignore conditions but is still present in the repository (due to being forcefully added), it is still excluded from the view.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Create a git repository, add it to Atom project.\n2. In Atom, enable the Exclude VCS Ignored Paths.\n3. Create a .gitignore file, add some condition.\n4. Create a file matching the condition from previous step. Using `git add -f`, add it to the repository.\n\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]\nThe file is displayed in Atom.\n\nThe rationale is: all VCS-controlled files are definitely a part of the project; the .gitignore contains the rules what files should not bother me suggesting to add it to the commit; but if I've added it already, it is the part of the project since that moment. Since the moment I've added it via `git add -f`, Git now tracks the changes in that file; whenever the file is changed, its changes are now reflected in the `git status`; that is, from the Git viewpoint, using `git add -f` overrides the .gitignore rule. Atom should behave accordingly to Git.\n\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\nThe file is not displayed in Atom.\n### Versions\n\nmacOS 10.12\n\n~:$ atom --version\nAtom    : 1.10.2\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\n\n~:$ apm --version \napm  1.12.5\nnpm  3.10.5\nnode 4.4.5\npython 2.7.12\ngit 2.8.4\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12881/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12880","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12880/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12880/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12880/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12880","id":181166535,"number":12880,"title":"script/build error \"Cannot find module 'internal/fs' ","user":{"login":"Aakash1312","id":10784031,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10784031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aakash1312","html_url":"https://github.com/Aakash1312","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aakash1312/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aakash1312/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aakash1312/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aakash1312/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aakash1312/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aakash1312/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aakash1312/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aakash1312/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aakash1312/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98407029,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/build-error","name":"build-error","color":"f7c6c7","default":false},{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-10-05T14:14:31Z","updated_at":"2016-10-05T19:01:53Z","closed_at":"2016-10-05T19:01:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [Y ] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n- [Y ] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [ Y] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [Y ] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [ Y] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [Y ] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\n[script/build error \"Cannot find module 'internal/fs' \"]\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nI cloned atom repo, installed all the mentioned repositories, then script/build gave this error:\n\n```\nNode:   v7.0.0-pre\nNpm:    v3.10.8\nInstalling script dependencies\nnpm ERR!
