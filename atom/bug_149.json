I recommend this to be addressed, because **it inhibits the portability** of the application.\n\n**It would be expected** that the `~/.atom` directory may be created when running the application, but not when installing, because it is necessary to change `$ATOM_HOME` environment variable to create portability, and in a portable environment, we cannot assume that the `~/.atom` has been created on first run.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nAtom is not installed, and your computer is in the state of never having Atom installed.\n1. Using Regshot take a snapshot of the files of the drives and the registry\n2. Run Atom's `\"script/build\" --install-dir ../atom-install --build-dir ../atom-build`\n3. Regshot after build and install to notice that the `~/.atom` directory has been created.\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n\nThe only directories created are the build and install directories.\n\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\n\nThe `%USERPROFILE%\\.atom` / `~\\.atom` folder is created with:\n- `~/.atom/.apm`\n- `~/.atom/compile-cache`\n- `~/.atom/.node-gyp`\n- `~/.atom/packages`\n### Versions\n\nmaster@f1cf66\n#### ATOM\n\n```\nAtom    : 1.8.0-dev-f1cf66b\nElectron: 0.36.8\nChrome  : 47.0.2526.110\nNode    : 5.1.1\n```\n#### APM\n\n```\napm  1.9.2\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.11\ngit 2.8.0.windows.1\nvisual studio 2015\n```\n#### OS\n\nWindows 10 - Version 1511\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11358","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11358/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11358/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11358/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11358","id":145543285,"number":11358,"title":"Modified files remain marked in Atom after repo is commited","user":{"login":"adamreisnz","id":490562,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/490562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreisnz","html_url":"https://github.com/adamreisnz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreisnz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreisnz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreisnz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreisnz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreisnz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreisnz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreisnz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreisnz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamreisnz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":247105569,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/git","name":"git","color":"fef2c0","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":13,"created_at":"2016-04-03T21:34:43Z","updated_at":"2016-07-15T09:21:12Z","closed_at":"2016-07-15T09:21:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"In Atom 1.8.0-dev-435dcc7, modified files remained marked as modified (e.g. coloured in the tabs and in tree view) even after a commit.\n\nTo reproduce: edit some files, commit the repository, go back to atom.

realize that this would take a major effort to implement, but I'd like to ask you to [give it five minutes](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes) instead of rejecting it out of the get go. Please thoughtfully consider this:\n\nI propose implementing Vim-style pane splitting / tab management in Atom.\n\nIn Vim, all pane splits are contained to a single tab. Changing the tab results in a having a different split configuration on screen which allows one to organize more efficient.\n\nImagine I have the following arrangement where I work on the redux data flow of a react app:\n\n<img width=\"1370\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-04-02 at 10 50 45\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/306633/14225138/e0be934a-f8c0-11e5-9857-1a5be0040e1f.png\">\n\nImagine now, that I want to start tweaking css in two different files, without disturbing the current pane split setup.\n\n<img width=\"1427\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-04-02 at 11 03 53\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/306633/14225195/a20647a4-f8c2-11e5-92e9-e6164cd2c022.png\">\n\nThere's no easy way to do this in the same Atom window. The reason for this fact is that in Atom, tabs are created for each pane, instead of for each pane container. \n\nIn Vim, creating a new tab would generate a fresh workspace with a fresh pane splitting context.\n\n**When we code, we conceptually split work into logically separate sections of the project, each of which involves working with multiple files at once: Data flow, Styling, UI components, etc.**\n\nAtom's current tab model sadly makes it difficult to map this way of working to the workspace. I think we would all benefit immensely from changing it. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11349/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11348","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11348/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11348/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11348/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11348","id":145326860,"number":11348,"title":"Update Electron to 0.36.12","user":{"login":"50Wliu","id":2766036,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2766036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu","html_url":"https://github.com/50Wliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":163641905,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/atom","name":"atom","color":"f7c6c7","default":false},{"id":193722948,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-review","name":"needs-review","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":45,"created_at":"2016-04-02T02:24:56Z","updated_at":"2016-04-30T07:20:04Z","closed_at":"2016-04-30T07:19:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/11348","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11348","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11348.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11348.patch"},"body":"Continuation of #10983.\n\nCloses #10983.\nFixes #11198.\n\n/cc @drewmnoel \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11347","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11347/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11347/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11347/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11347","id":145310252,"number":11347,"title":"Data loss when trying to save read-only file","user":{"login":"EvanGoss","id":8098376,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8098376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanGoss","html_url":"https://github.com/EvanGoss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanGoss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanGoss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanGoss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanGoss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanGoss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanGoss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanGoss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanGoss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanGoss/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-04-01T23:41:27Z","updated_at":"2016-04-02T06:56:38Z","closed_at":"2016-04-02T00:10:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\n\nTrying to overwrite read-only file when closing a file results in the file closing without successfully saving.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.

This continues the investigation started on #11326 and attempts to fix it using a different approach.\n\nIt turns out that the issue with pinch-to-zoom occurs only under certain circumstances; on my MacBook, it happens only whenever I do the following:\n1. Start Atom with my MacBook closed and my external monitor on;\n2. Open my Macbook, so that both displays are on;\n3. Try to pinch the tree-view;\n4. :boom: \n\n_(The above never happens if my MacBook is open when Atom is launched)_\n\nAs soon as a new display gets added or removed, in facts, the zoom level limit of the web frame is reset to the default and hence the page becomes zoomable again. This doesn't happen when changing the display's metrics (e.g. screen resolution), so I assume it must be something related to adding/removing displays. I have verified this arises also when enabling/disabling mirroring, which is considered by OS X as adding/removing one display.\n\nElectron provides two events which allow us to detect when a display gets added or removed, so that we can reset the zoom level limits to `(1, 1)` every time this happens. I suspect this is what is happening in #8850, and this PR should fix it once for all.\n\n/cc: @joshaber @nathansobo @mnquintana @atom/feedback for extra :eyes: :eyes: :eyes:.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11344","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11344/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11344/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11344/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11344","id":145187376,"number":11344,"title":"Azerty keyboard support broken","user":{"login":"Mikarnage","id":1443408,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1443408?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mikarnage","html_url":"https://github.com/Mikarnage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mikarnage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mikarnage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mikarnage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mikarnage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mikarnage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mikarnage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mikarnage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mikarnage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mikarnage/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true},{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-04-01T13:56:02Z","updated_at":"2016-04-01T15:47:44Z","closed_at":"2016-04-01T15:47:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\n\nSome very common (for a developper) characters of the azerty keyboard (\"]\", \"}\") don't work with default bindings.\nTyping \"}\" doesn't do anything, and typing \"]\" collapses the current block and doesn't write \"]\".\n\nIs it possible to disable the binding associated with it?\nAnyway, it shouldn't be the default setting..\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.

The project is on a sparsedisk image (this was needed in order to have a case-sensitive filesystem) and is about 1.8G in size.\n\nWhen I alt-tab to another application (e.g. iTerm2)  and then get back to atom for a few seconds the editor is unresponsive and these two Atom Helper processes go to 100% CPU. This behaviour was even worse before I deleted ~45G of data that was stored in the project folder (I can live leaving the data on a remote server, but it was nice to be able to test the code directly on my laptop...)\n\nI'm including a startup CPU profile and two profiles during which I alt-tabbed to get the issue at least twice during the time spent profiling.\n\n**Expected behavior:** [What you
