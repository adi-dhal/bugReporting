(Surprisingly, it is not possible to get this information programmatically\ntoday, though ServiceHub could potentially be expanded to provide this. However,\nit would only work for providers statically declared in `package.json`, but not for\nthose that are registered dynamically, so it might not be worth it.)\n\nWhen a `Directory` is created via a `DirectoryProvider`, the correspoding Atom\npackage via `DirectoryProvider::getHostPackage()` is recorded as part of the `Project`\nso it can be serialized along with the `Project`'s paths.\n\nThis way, when `Project` is deserialized, paths that have a corresponding \"host package\"\ncan be filtered from ones that do not. Paths without a corresponding host package will\nbe loaded normally. Those with a host package will have their package activated so\nthe `DirectoryProvider` can be restored, which will hopefully be able to recreate the\nroot folder from the previous session.\n\nWhen a new `DirectoryProvider` is registered, the `Project` checks to see whether\nthere were any paths from the previous session that correspond to its host package.\nIf so, each path is fed to the provider's async `directoryForURI` method. Assuming it\nreturns a `Promise` that returns a non-null value, the path will be added to the\n`Project` via `atom.project.addPath()`. This allows the provider to do any async I/O\nor network communication it needs to do to recreate the `Directory` (which it should\ncache) before its synchronous `directoryForURISync()` method is invoked as a side-effect\nof `atom.project.addPath()`. Assuming the provider caches the path->`Directory` mapping\nduring the async invocation, it can return it immediately as part of the sync invocation.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5812","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5812/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5812/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5812/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5812","id":59586828,"number":5812,"title":"Add Workspace::onWillOpen ","user":{"login":"benogle","id":69169,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/69169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle","html_url":"https://github.com/benogle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2015-03-03T02:41:39Z","updated_at":"2015-04-15T17:09:37Z","closed_at":"2015-03-03T19:44:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/5812","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5812","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5812.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5812.patch"},"body":"This will add an `Workspace::onWillOpen` event to allow fixing https://github.com/atom/welcome/issues/26.
