Install atom-ide-ui package\r\n2. Open the diagnostics pane\r\n3. Switch from One Light to One Dark or vice-versa\r\n4. Observe wrong color for table column header\r\n\r\nActual part of the css is\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.nuclide-ui-table-header {\r\n  font-weight: bold;\r\n  background-color: @pane-item-background-color;\r\n  border-bottom: 1px solid @base-border-color;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `@pane-item-background-color` is still resolving to the old value.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### UI theme\r\n\r\nThis can especially be seen when switching from white to black themes or reverse:\r\n![themeswitching](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11966684/11130908/f63e6bf8-8987-11e5-9162-00a59b8124d8.PNG)\r\n![themeswitching2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11966684/11131319/70b2a4ec-898a-11e5-94ce-19dd86b7d37b.PNG)\r\n\r\nWhen restarting Atom the theme is correctly applied. However at least one package also often ignores a restart and show the wrong colour. This is:\r\n- editor-stats as reported [here](https://github.com/atom/editor-stats/issues/28) already previously where this issue only was about this single addon\r\n\r\nAnd FYI when switching back to the theme you switched from everything is displayed normally (or as before you switched - `editor-stats` still looks like it looked always)\r\n\r\nThis is similar to the issue https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8860 which was fixed before, but Atom does not show any warnings in the developer console.\r\n### Syntax theme\r\n\r\nI can also see this happening with the sytax theme. However here it only applies to `markdown-preview` (same issues as above; works when restarting Atom) and the editor seems to be changed correctly.\r\nHowever when looking more carefully even here sometimes it does also not correctly change the font colour of a file (reproduced with a markdown file). When switching to a dark syntax theme the text stays grew. In this case also the global font setting is not applied correctly and does not change the font (note that it was correctly applied to a file opened after changing the theme).\r\n\r\nOne time it also did not changed the colour of the line numbers:\r\n![linenumbers](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11966684/11131689/2eeb2c6c-898c-11e5-9bf6-56956492bb67.PNG)\r\n\r\nAtom 1.1.0\r\nWindows 7\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9550/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9549","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9549/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9549/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9549/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9549","id":116630470,"number":9549,"title":"Scrolling through document is sluggish","user":{"login":"danielbonnell","id":8513877,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8513877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielbonnell","html_url":"https://github.com/danielbonnell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielbonnell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielbonnell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielbonnell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielbonnell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielbonnell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielbonnell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielbonnell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielbonnell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielbonnell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":52925411,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/performance","name":"performance","color":"d4c5f9","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":20,"created_at":"2015-11-12T20:11:30Z","updated_at":"2017-09-29T02:57:38Z","closed_at":"2016-01-10T21:20:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, I just upgraded to Atom v1.1.0 and have noticed an issue with scrolling.

has a delay of ~1 second to respond to input when re-focusing. Seems to only affect Atom when a project folder is in a git repository.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\nOpen Atom\nAdd a directory to your project that is a git repository or a subfolder of a git repository.\nOpen a file or create a new document in the same Atom session.\nSwitch to a different application.\nClick back on Atom and wait for your input to be accepted.\n\nWhen you click back on Atom there is a delay of 1~1.5 seconds before your action is performed (tab switch if you clicked a tab, cursor to start blinking if you clicked in the text of a document).\n\nI ran the profiler during the task switching and I got the following data (rename the file to .json if necessary):\n[TimelineRawData-20151112T091728.txt](https://github.com/atom/atom/files/32999/TimelineRawData-20151112T091728.txt)\n\nI am able to solve the issue only by removing the git folder from my project.\n\nI'm not versed in reading the profiling data but it looks like a call to `git-repository.js` is taking a lot of time up when the re-focus happens.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9544/reactions","total_count":33,"+1":33,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9543","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9543/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9543/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9543/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9543","id":116571141,"number":9543,"title":"Failed to activate the org package","user":{"login":"wolves","id":552507,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/552507?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolves","html_url":"https://github.com/wolves","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolves/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolves/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolves/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolves/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolves/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolves/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolves/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolves/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolves/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722939,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"e6e6e6","default":true},{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-11-12T15:22:45Z","updated_at":"2015-11-12T20:22:04Z","closed_at":"2015-11-12T20:21:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[Enter steps to reproduce below:]\n1.

It accepts a `callback` which must return a `Promise`: when this resolves or gets rejected (or the `callback` throws an error) we complete the transaction.\n\nI am not super happy with the name I've chosen for this API, as it would have probably been better to follow Node's conventions (i.e. rename `::transact` to `::transactSync` and name the new one `::transact`): unfortunately that method name was already taken and it's part of the public API.\n\nAnother thought was to include this feature right inside the existing `::transact` method: although possible, the resulting method would need to conform to two different contracts based on the return type of `callback`, which feels somewhat misleading for clients. In the end having a separate method felt somewhat cleaner.\n\nFeedback super welcome! :bow:  \n\n/cc: @nathansobo @joshaber @atom/feedback
