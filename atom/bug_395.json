script/grunt install\n```\n\nwhen i do this, i get back --\n\n```\n/usr/bin/env: node: No such file or directory.\n```\n\nafter getting this, i went and looked in the `script/grunt` file and found this on the very top line --\n\n```\n!#/usr/bin/env: node\n```\n\nso it's expecting node to be in the `/usr/bin/env`. however, my install of node is _not_ there. i installed node using the final method in [this article with instructions for installing node on ubuntu, via the nvm version manager](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-an-ubuntu-14-04-server). my node install for node v.0.10.32 is in --\n\n```\n/home/faddah/.nvm/v0.10.32/bin/node\n```\n\nso i went in with `vi` and changed the `script/grunt` file so the first line is --\n\n```\n!#/home/faddah/.nvm/v0.10.32/bin:

The `ScopedDescriptor`s returned from the editor can contain the file path, which config can deal with accordingly. \n\nThis is added in a pretty non intrusive way.
