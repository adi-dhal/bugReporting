Selecting groups of lines and pasting them at column zero now works as expected.\n\nNote that the relative indentation of the copied text is still preserved on paste, as before.\n\nThis change removes one 'Public' method - `Selection::normalizeLines`. I thought of deprecating it, but it implemented a behavior that this PR removes, and no package calls it.\n\nCloses #4272.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4288/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4287","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4287/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4287/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4287/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4287","id":49800075,"number":4287,"title":"Main menu keyboard shortcut conflicts?","user":{"login":"rakkarage","id":962340,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/962340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakkarage","html_url":"https://github.com/rakkarage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakkarage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakkarage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakkarage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakkarage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakkarage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakkarage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakkarage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakkarage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakkarage/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":62363277,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-11-22T18:13:03Z","updated_at":"2014-11-30T18:41:27Z","closed_at":"2014-11-30T18:41:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"when i press alt the F in the File menu is underlined yet when i press ALT+F i get editor:move-to-end-of-word?\nand when i press ALT+H to supposedly access the help menu i get editor:delete-to-beginning-of-word?\nthe rest of the menu keyboard shortcuts work\nconflict only happens when an editor window has focus i guess\nit works fine when for example all files are closed or no editor has focus\ni am on windows\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4287/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4286","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4286/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4286/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4286/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/4286","id":49793904,"number":4286,"title":"Wrong Reactionary dependence","user":{"login":"m0x72","id":5238290,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5238290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/m0x72","html_url":"https://github.com/m0x72","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m0x72/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m0x72/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m0x72/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m0x72/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m0x72/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m0x72/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m0x72/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m0x72/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m0x72/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-11-22T15:03:18Z","updated_at":"2014-11-25T20:20:43Z","closed_at":"2014-11-25T20:20:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/4286","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/4286","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/4286.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/4286.patch"},"body":"`exports/atom.coffee` requires package `reactionary` while atom only has `reactionary-atom-fork` as a dependence (https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/package.json#L53).
