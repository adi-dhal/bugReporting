packages with `apm list --installed --bare > package-list.txt` (for backup or to install same packages on several computers with `apm install --packages-file package-list.txt`).\r\nWould be greatly appreciated a `--enabled` parameter to list only enabled installed packages, the ones we really use. With the huge amount of packages out there is very common to install/try some and then just disable them to give another try later instead of uninstalling it, so the difference between the list of installed and the subset of enabled could be really big.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

My main problem is that I don't know where to start looking since I don't get any error messages from `atom`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14960/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14959","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14959/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14959/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14959/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14959","id":240722005,"number":14959,"title":"⬆ github@0.3.8","user":{"login":"BinaryMuse","id":189606,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/189606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse","html_url":"https://github.com/BinaryMuse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-07-05T17:29:32Z","updated_at":"2017-07-13T23:15:09Z","closed_at":"2017-07-13T23:14:50Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/14959","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14959","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14959.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14959.patch"},"body":"### [github](https://github.com/atom/github)\r\n\r\nv0.3.3...v0.3.8\r\n\r\n* [atom/github#916 -

Happens even in safe mode. I've checked many threads and none of them had a solution for my problem, nor did they fit my description well. I've already uninstalled and reinstalled atom, tried the beta, cleared the window state, deleted my .atom folder, upgraded my graphics drivers, disabled and uninstalled all packages, commented out my entire init file, and disabled my anti-virus.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Start atom without any project folders or files open.\r\n2. Click around and open settings, switch tabs, write some code; no freezing, works flawlessly.\r\n3. File > add project folder (Happens with every folder I have tried)\r\n4. Step 2 again, every 10 seconds or so, haven't timed it, Atom will just freeze completely.\r\n5. Remove project folder that was added in step 3\r\n6. Repeat step 2 again and find that the results are the same as those from step 4.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\nNo freezing\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\nFreezing\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\n50% of the time I have a project folder\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nAtom    : 1.18.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.15\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\napm  1.18.1\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython 3.6.1\r\ngit 2.8.0.windows.1\r\nvisual studio\r\nWindows 10 64bit\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nBelow is the cpuprofile I saved when I was reproducing the issue. In this profile, atom froze up 4 times, which I think is conveyed through the cpu profile if that helps. I also get the error `Failed to clear temp storage: It was determined that certain files are unsafe for access within a Web application, or that too many calls are being made on file resources. SecurityError` whenever I start up Atom.\r\n\r\n[CPU-20170701T155442.zip](https://github.com/atom/atom/files/1117469/CPU-20170701T155442.zip)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4201","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507404130","x-github-request-id":"90B8:366F:BD67D0:1713B32:59D92778","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=31>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=29>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"1c3a49c48f123dc5538de797409675b3\"","status":"200 OK"}}
