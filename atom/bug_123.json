request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\nI can cause the python syntax highlighting to render everything as a string (in green, by default) with the following python code:\n\n```\nclass SomeClass:\n\n    \"\"\"This is a docstring with 'DELETE' in the first line.\n\n    If the docstring contains another single quote anywhere in the body the\n    rest of this file will be highlighted correctly.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def foo(self):\n        pass # this should not be rendered in green!\n```\n\nAtom renders this like so:\n\n![broken screenshot](http://static.inky.ws/image/5776/Screenshot%20from%202016-07-12%2013-21-57.png)\n\nThe key here seems to be that you need the word `DELETE` in either single quotes, double quotes, or backticks. `DELETE` by itself (i.e.- unquoted) is not enough to break the syntax highlighting. I've not found any other words that seem to produce this behaviour (I thought perhaps it was all HTTP methods, but PUT, GET, HEAD, etc don't trigger the same behaviour).  It's also curious that `DELETE` is rendered as a keyword here, when it probably shouldn't be.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Copy the above snippet into a file ending in '.py'\n2. Open the file in atom.\n\n**Expected behaviour:** \n\nI expect everything past the first docstring to render correctly (i.e.- not as if it were all one large string).\n\n**Actual behaviour:** \n\nSee screenshot above.\n### Versions\n\nAtom    : 1.8.0\nElectron: 0.36.8\nChrome  : 47.0.2526.110\nNode    : 5.1.1\n\napm  1.9.2\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.11+\ngit 2.7.4\n\nOperating system

Atom running, I am unable to open any other files/directories from the command line. If there isn't an existing instance of Atom running, I'm able to open files/directories as normal with `atom -a dir/` or `atom filename`.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open Atom\n2. Attempt to open a file/directory using `atom -a dir/` or `atom filename`\n\n**Expected behavior:** \n\nExpect that when Atom is open, I can open a new file or directory using `atom filename` or `atom -a dir/`.\n\n**Actual behavior:**\n\nWhen I try to open up a file or directory, Atom doesn't do anything at all. It looks like Atom is opening on my system, but then the app quickly closes. Note, this is independent of the existing running instance of Atom.\n\nHere is the stack trace from `/var/log/system.log`\n\n```\nJul 11 13:46:52 SIA-MC-W01PG3QC loginwindow[91]: -[SFLListManager(ServiceReplyProtocol) notifyChanges:toListWithIdentifier:] Notified of item changes to list with identifier com.apple.LSSharedFileList.RecentApplications\nJul 11 13:46:52 SIA-MC-W01PG3QC iTerm2[42729]: Time to encode state for window <PseudoTerminal: 0x7fe60062d500 tabs=1 window=<PTYWindow: 0x7fe60072a0c0 frame=NSRect: {{-1080, 60}, {1074, 1881}} title=1. tmux alpha=1.000000 isMain=0 isKey=0 isVisible=1 delegate=0x7fe60062d500>>: 0.00199204683303833\nJul 11 13:46:52 SIA-MC-W01PG3QC Atom[6463]: App load time: 320ms\nJul 11 13:46:52 SIA-MC-W01PG3QC Atom[90817]: Unexpected end of input\nJul 11 13:46:52 SIA-MC-W01PG3QC Atom[90817]: SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input\n            at Object.parse (native)\n            at Socket.<anonymous> (/Users/nland/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/src/browser/atom-application.js:244:28)\n            at emitOne (events.js:77:13)\n            at Socket.emit (events.js:169:7)\n            at readableAddChunk (_stream_readable.js:146:16)\n            at Socket.Readable.push (_stream_readable.js:110:10)\n            at Pipe.onread (net.js:523:20)\nJul 11 13:46:52 SIA-MC-W01PG3QC Atom[90817]: Unexpected token r\nJul 11 13:46:52 SIA-MC-W01PG3QC Atom[90817]: SyntaxError: Unexpected token r\n            at Object.parse (native)\n            at Socket.<anonymous> (/Users/nland/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/src/browser/atom-application.js:244:28)\n            at emitOne (events.js:77:13)\n            at Socket.emit (events.js:169:7)\n            at readableAddChunk (_stream_readable.js:146:16)\n            at Socket.Readable.push (_stream_readable.js:110:10)\n            at Pipe.onread (net.js:523:20)\n```\n### Versions\n\napm version `1.9.2`\natom version `1.8.0`\n\nRunning on osx `10.11.5`\n\nYou can get this information from executing `atom --version` and `apm --version` at the command line.

I've lost good chunks of code for not realizing my undos are clearing lots of others things too than just my latest debug session.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open a document\n2. Type something (and save)\n3. Close Atom\n4. Open Atom\n5. Open the same doc as in step 1\n6.

This means removing the following atom-specific dependencies:\n- [x] Config\n  \n  Instead of each `TextEditor` internally observing the config and updating its behavior accordingly, the `TextEditorRegistry` (an atom-specific class) will observe the config and update text editors from outside, using new public APIs like `setUndoGroupingInterval`.\n  \n  In order to handle settings like `nonWordCharacters` which can vary according to the cursor's position, the `TextEditor` will have an optional 'scoped settings delegate', which will allow the editor to query for settings at particular scopes. Example:\n  \n  ``` js\n  editor.setScopedSettingsDelegate({\n    getCommentStartString (scopes) {\n      if (languageLooksLikeC(scopes)) {\n        return \"//\"\n      } else {\n        return \"#\"\n      }\n    },\n  \n    getNonWordCharacters (scopes) {\n      // logic ...\n    }\n  })\n  ```\n- [x] GrammarRegistry\n\nThis also removes a duplicate call to `DisplayLayer::reset` that was happening in the `TextEditor` constructor. For a big file like `text-editor-component-spec.js`, this makes the editor visible about  120 ms sooner 🎉 .\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12125/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12124","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12124/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12124/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12124/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12124","id":164582893,"number":12124,"title":"\"Atom installation on Windows 7 produced no shortcut or OS integration\"","user":{"login":"DingBEN","id":20358705,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/20358705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DingBEN","html_url":"https://github.com/DingBEN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DingBEN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DingBEN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DingBEN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DingBEN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DingBEN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DingBEN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DingBEN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DingBEN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DingBEN/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":176631763,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/installer","name":"installer","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":62363277,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":16,"created_at":"2016-07-08T17:55:23Z","updated_at":"2017-07-23T14:43:35Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"UPDATE July 29th, 2016\n\n---\n\n**WIN 7 Pro  ...
