I use Unity as my window manager. Atom version is 0.188.0. \n\nIf I open a file from Nautilus file manager by pressing \"Enter\" or by double-clicking, Atom often doesn't come to foreground. (Its icon wobbles in Unity dashboard.) To see it, I have to switch to Atom manually. Only after that, I can work on the file. \n\nI made some tests. It happens when Atom is already open and if I use Alt+Tab key combination. If I never use Alt+Tab to switch between windows, then there's no problem. Otherwise, first I've to open file, then manually switch to Atom window. Unfortunately It's inefficinet way to work.\n\nWhat I want is, Atom should always come to foreground, if I open a file.

Note how it is up against the window, and it is shifted horizontally and flipped vertically to keep within the window.\n\n![autocomplete-recompute-better](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/69169/6933332/8b437e92-d7da-11e4-8e81-8485c5cc1968.gif)\n### Notes\n- The overlay parent is the `atom-text-editor`. The editor and containing pane are now both `overflow: visible`. This allows the pane item the flexibility to have things jump out if necessary.\n- When bumping up against the left or right edge of the window, the overlay will _shift_ horizontally, not flip. This always keeps it in the window frame. Shifting felt more natural than flipping.\n- When bumping up against the bottom edge of the window, the overlay will flip. It will not necessarily be always visible in the window frame (due to scrolling), but does its best with the flip.\n- A `left-margin` is supported on the overlay. It will take the margin into account when doing the window bounds-checking. Note the blue box in the first image has a `-250px` left margin.\n- In the future, it would be nice to allow configuration of the shift or flip, or bounds checking at all, but for right now, keeping it simple.\n### TODO\n- [x] Make it work\n- [x] Clean up the overlay caching :art:\n- [x] Move specs to the presenter\n- [x] All specs passing\n\ncc @nathansobo @bolinfest \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6197/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6196","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6196/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6196/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6196/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6196","id":65585017,"number":6196,"title":"Sync update of overlay decorations with editor's DOM update/read lifecycle","user":{"login":"benogle","id":69169,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/69169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle","html_url":"https://github.com/benogle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-04-01T02:02:20Z","updated_at":"2015-04-02T01:24:28Z","closed_at":"2015-04-02T01:24:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The overlay decoration updates happen out of phase with the editor update/read cycle.

Could we provide another method? `editor.onWillUpdateDocument()`?
