Searching for `e` in `jquery.js` now blocks the UI thread for ~1 second instead of ~3.2 seconds. Inserting newlines in this file with the markers present now takes ~10 ms instead of ~35 ms.\n\nI still need to make the changes to find-and-replace backwards compatible and merge them after merging these changes.\n## API Changes\n### Marker Layers\n\nA huge problem with our existing implementation is that creating markers emits synchronous events to support existing packages and core APIs. We needed a way to opt out of these event handlers for high-volume use cases, and marker layers were a good way to do this.\n- `TextBuffer`\n  - `.addMarkerLayer({maintainHistory})` Creates and returns a `MarkerLayer` object. If `maintainHistory` is `true`, markers will be restored on calls to undo/redo.\n  - `.getMarkerLayer` Retrieve a marker layer based on its id.\n- `MarkerLayer` Some highlights:\n  - `.markRange` Creates a marker.\n  - `.getMarker` Gets a marker by id.\n  - `.findMarkers` Queries the marker layer.\n  - `.onDidUpdate` Called asynchronously whenever markers are created, updated, or destroyed. Can be used without being a drag on performance, but you'll have to re-query any state you're interested in between calls.\n  - `.onDidCreateMarker` This is needed to support our current synchronous selection APIs, but it shouldn't be used on layers that will contain a large number of markers because it slows down insertion.\n  - `.copy` Create and return a new marker layer with all the same markers.\n- `TextEditor`\n  - `.addMarkerLayer({maintainHistory})` Creates and returns a `TextEditorMarkerLayer`.\n  - `.getMarkerLayer` Retrieve an editor-level marker layer based on its id.\n- `TextEditorMarkerLayer` This is a wrapper around a buffer-level `MarkerLayer` object and shares the same id.\n  - `.markBufferRange` Create a marker.\n  - `.markScreenRange` Create a marker.\n  - `.findMarkers` Query markers with the same API as `TextEditor.prototype.findMarkers`\n### Marker Layer Decorations\n\nAnother huge source of slowness in find and replace is that we decorated each marker individually. Now that we have marker layers, we can decorate an entire layer in the same way, avoiding a ton of allocations.\n- `TextEditor`\n  - `.decorateMarkerLayer(layer, properties)` Accepts a `MarkerLayer` or `TextEditorMarkerLayer` and the same properties that `decorateMarker` takes. It creates a decoration for every marker in the layer based on these parameters. This won't work for custom gutter decorations or overlay decorations, but _will_ work for highlights, line, and line number decorations. Returns a `LayerDecoration`.\n- `LayerDecoration`\n  - `setPropertiesForMarker(marker, properties)` This can be used to override the properties of a particular marker in the layer. We needed this to support the \"current result\" in find and replace without major changes to the package code. Pass `null` to clear the override.\n## New Marker Index\n\n![marker-binary-tree](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1789/10924350/062ead24-823b-11e5-85ee-ffd1e77df82f.png)\n\nThis PR also incorporates a new binary-tree-based [marker-index](https://github.com/atom/marker-index), which replaces the previous b-tree-based index in text-buffer. It offers better and more predictable performance... about 33% faster on my insertion tests (from 1.6 second to 1 second) and an order of magnitude faster at splicing. 1 second is still too long to block the UI thread, so we may still need to background the index population. I would like to experiment with a C++ implementation and see what it buys us, since it's a straightforward implementation that should be fairly easy to port.\n## Performance Improvements\n\nNow on to the good part... the improvement. This shows results from 3 implementations. The current version, marker layers with the old index, and marker layers with the new index.\n### Without marker layers (current implementation)\n#### Inserting ~20k markers:\n\n~3.2 seconds\n\n<img

having an issue where git on the command line doesn't report a file as changed, but Atom is showing the file as changed in the tree view.\n\nOpening the file shows +22, -22 in the stats indicator in Atom, but doesn't show any individual line in the file as changed. (There are no bars indicating changed lines on the left.) If I change the file, the changed lines are shown as changed in the bars on the left, but no other lines in the file are shown as changed (as the stats indicator would have you believe).\n\nShowing hidden characters lets me see that the line endings in the file are indeed different, but these changes are ignored by git, as per my settings.\n\nNow here's something weird I discovered in the process of debugging this issue. This might actually be a bug in git...\n\n``` text\n$ git config core.autocrlf\ninput\n$ git config --global core.autocrlf\n$ git config --local core.autocrlf\n$ git config --system core.autocrlf\n```\n\ngit seems to think my `core.autocrlf` setting is set to \"input\", but I don't have it set to that anywhere in my settings. Why? I have no idea. Anyone know if this is a bug in git? And if so, where do I report it?\n\nSetting `core.autocrlf` explicitly seems to resolve the inconsistency, causing Atom to once again ignore changes to line endings:\n\n``` text\n$ git config --global core.autocrlf input\n```\n\nThis difference of behavior is confusing though. Is this a bug in Atom? Or perhaps a bug in git, git-utils, or maybe libgit2?\n\nNote I'm running `git version 2.6.2.windows.1` on Windows 10, and Atom v1.1.0.\n\nNote: _Issue migrated from
