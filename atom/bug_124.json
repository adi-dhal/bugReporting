Sometimes you want to set a value which might be equal to the \"original\" default value. However, atom detects that and removes it automatically, causing the actual default value (in \"*\") to be used.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Set default (\"*\") tab length to 4\n2. Try to set other language's tab length to 2\n\nSince 2 is the default value, it's automatically removed and causes the \"*\" default of 4 to be used.\n\nBefore save:\n\n``` coffee\n\"*\":\n  editor:\n    tabLength: 4\n\".coffee.source\":\n  editor:\n    tabLength: 2\n\".c.source\":\n  editor:\n    tabLength: 2\n\".cpp.source\":\n  editor:\n    tabLength: 2\n\".go.source\":\n  editor:\n    tabLength: 2\n\".python.source\":\n  editor:\n    tabLength: 2\n```\n\nAfter save:\n\n``` coffee\n\"*\":\n  editor:\n    tabLength: 4\n\".c.source\":\n  editor:\n    tabLength: 4\n\".coffee.source\":\n  editor:\n    tabLength: 4\n\".cpp.source\":\n  editor:\n    tabLength: 4\n\".go.source\":\n  editor:\n    tabLength: 4\n\".python.source\":\n  editor:\n    tabLength: 2\n\n```\n\nNote: this is not a mistake, Python actually does preserve the desired value of 2. Why? Because its default value is 4, not 2.\n### Versions\n\nTested with Atom 1.8.0, using a completely clean, freshly created .atom directory in Windows 10 64bit.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12103/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12102","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12102/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12102/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12102/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12102","id":163864210,"number":12102,"title":"Unable to select text or move cursor with keyboard shortcuts CMD+Arrow/CMD+Shift+Arrow using keyboard","user":{"login":"StephenOTT","id":1994838,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1994838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenOTT","html_url":"https://github.com/StephenOTT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenOTT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenOTT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenOTT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenOTT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenOTT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenOTT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenOTT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenOTT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenOTT/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":171329633,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-reproduction","name":"needs-reproduction","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-07-05T14:27:54Z","updated_at":"2016-07-13T16:05:33Z","closed_at":"2016-07-13T16:05:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nUnable to select entire field / unable to move cursor to start and end of field using keyboard shortcuts native to mac when in Save dialog\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. open file\n2. open save dialog window.  \n3. in the file name text field attempt to move the cursor using the keyboard from start of field or end or vice versa (CMD+Arrow Left or CMD+Arrow Right)\n4.

Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nAtom crashes with an \"Editor not responding\" message when loading a /dist/main.js file in a React.js project. If you're familiar with the React.js framework, main.js is a JavaScript file generated by tools like gulp, browserify and reactify to merge all libraries into one JavaScript file in order to be browser friendly. It is important to note that in this instance, the resulting file is approximately 21,000 lines of code.\n\nProcess information from top. Over 100% cpu being consumed by Atom Helper\n\n```\n53222  Atom Helper  101.0 01:31.25 21/1  0    124   250M   0B     0B     52624 52624 running  *0[2]            0.00000 0.00000    501  135808    1575\n```\n\nProblem is reproducible 100% of the time and occurs in safe mode.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Launch Atom\n2. File -> Add Project Folder -> Add folder with 21k line (1.8MB) main.js file\n\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]\nCPU usage remains stable. Ability to edit and scroll through files as large or larger than 21k of code with given hardware (see versions).\n\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\nA few seconds to a minute after adding the project folder containing a 21k line main.js file CPU usage from an Atom helper process exceeds 100%. Error message \"Editor not responding\" occurs.\n### Versions\n\n```\nAtom    : 1.8.0\nElectron: 0.36.8\nChrome  : 47.0.2526.110\nNode    : 5.1.1\napm  1.9.2\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.10\ngit 2.7.4\nMac OS X: 10.11.4\nMacBookPro Retina 15-Inch\n2.5 GHz Intel Core i7 (4 Core)\n16GB RAM\nnVidia GPU\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12094/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4107","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507404130","x-github-request-id":"9912:3670:9F2977:199D9DC:59D928EE","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=125>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=123>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"943c093acd11937609521d822db37c0e\"","status":"200 OK"}}
