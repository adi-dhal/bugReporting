2.0.0 exports jquery so let's use it through there instead of from `vendor/`\n\nThis upgrades us from jquery `1.7.1` to `2.0.3`.\n### Things learned\n- jquery focused rules changed a bit and a couple specs needed to be updated to be attached to the DOM. [:link:](http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#order-of-triggered-focus-events)\n- [triggerHandler](http://api.jquery.com/triggerHandler/) has to be used for triggering focus/blur events on the `window` in specs.\n- The old hacks for getting jquery to work headless no longer work.  We used to have a fake window object in `task-bootstrap` that shimmed just enough to have it requireable without throwing an error.  These shims no longer work and we shouldn't be used jquery tasks anyway so this has been removed.\n- Doing `$(window).trigger 'beforeunload'` in specs causes jquery 2.0 to blow up, wrapping it up in a legit event works.\n### Going forward\n\nPackages should now feel free to rely on `space-pen` directly in their `package.json` since it now exports `$`/`jQuery` complete with all [these](https://github.com/atom/space-pen/blob/master/src/jquery-extensions.coffee) extensions.\n\nRefs #950\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/977/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/976","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/976/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/976/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/976/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/976","id":21046993,"number":976,"title":"Tab indents way too far, requires lots of backspacing","user":{"login":"cobyism","id":296432,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/296432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobyism","html_url":"https://github.com/cobyism","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobyism/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobyism/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobyism/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobyism/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobyism/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobyism/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobyism/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobyism/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobyism/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2013-10-15T21:50:01Z","updated_at":"2014-01-17T23:09:37Z","closed_at":"2014-01-17T23:09:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Encountered this when working in a nested `link_to` block.

This also upgrades us to the latest underscore release, `1.5.2`.\n\nThis also replaces the `MessageChannel` based implementation of  `_.nextTick` with a shim to `setImmediate` since that original method predates us having node support. `_.nextTick` should no longer be used\n\nNew packages should depend on this library directly when needed.\n\n:mega::mega::mega:\nThe only thing that was weird upgrading was that `_.max` now returns a different value if multiple values in the same array produce the same value and that value is the max.  Previously it returned the last element with the max value, now it returns the first element.  We only had one place this mattered, when selecting a grammar in one spec we were relying on the last grammar in the list having precedence when they both generated the same path score.\nhttps://github.com/jashkenas/underscore/pull/1124\n:shell::shell::shell:\n\nRefs #950 \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/973/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/972","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/972/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/972/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/972/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/972","id":21025996,"number":972,"title":"Installed Packages show up in Available Packages","user":{"login":"bnferguson","id":47749,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/47749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnferguson","html_url":"https://github.com/bnferguson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnferguson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnferguson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnferguson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnferguson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnferguson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnferguson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnferguson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnferguson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bnferguson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"kevinsawicki","id":671378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/671378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinsawicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"assignees":[{"login":"kevinsawicki","id":671378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/671378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinsawicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2013-10-15T16:01:49Z","updated_at":"2013-11-14T01:09:07Z","closed_at":"2013-11-14T00:59:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The Available packages tab seems to show all packages, installed and not.

Batches of typing can be repeated, undone, and generally messed with atomically. For example:\n\n`2iabc<esc>` will enter insert mode, let you type `abc`, and when you leave insert mode, `abc` will appear a second time, having been entered twice.\n\nMuch more usefully:\n\n`iabc<esc><move around>.` will enter insert mode, type `abc`, leave insert mode, move to a new location, and repeat the last insert at the new location. Great for things like strings in tests.\n\nI poked around at adding this tonight. Up in vim-mode land it's actually not that complicated, but  I ran into the weeds when I started to look at the telepath library SharedString underlying text buffers. It sure looks like these classes are just _aching_ to support this kind of thing, what with their patches and transactions, but the transactions I see in the undo history are all associated with particular locations.\n\nIs it possible to expose the concept of patches somehow?
