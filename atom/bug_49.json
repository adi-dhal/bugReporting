Have a directory with a directory that has spaces in the name as one of it's parent folders.\r\n    * For example: `C:\\foo bar\\foo`\r\n2. From the CLI (`cmd.exe` or PowerShell) attempt to open the folder with a trailing slash in the command.\r\n    * For example: `atom 'C:\\Temp\\foo bar\\foo\\'`\r\n3. Note that Atom has opened the _parent_ folder, with the desired folder name open as a \"file\" with an `\"` on the end.\r\n    * For example: Atom open to `C:\\foo bar` with an empty \"file\" of `foo\"` open.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nAtom opens the desired folder, regardless of whether there was a trailing `\\` on the path.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\nAtom opens the _parent_ folder, with an empty file named after the desired folder with a `\"` on the end open.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/427137/25925238/38cb37c8-359c-11e7-9b06-3f58f081a577.png)\r\n_The window on the left is the behavior of the first command, the window on the right is the second command (and the expected behavior)._\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:**\r\n\r\n100% of the time.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nTested on Windows 10 x64 on:\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.17.0-beta5\r\nElectron: 1.3.15\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso tested on:\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.18.0-dev-fb9fd2fbf\r\nElectron: 1.3.15\r\nChrome  :

the following variations...\r\n\r\nWorking:\r\n* Anything that doesn't have the `\\`, or doesn't have a space in any parent folder\r\n\r\nFailing under both PowerShell and old fashioned `cmd.exe`:\r\n* `PS C:\\Temp> atom '.\\foo bar\\foo\\'`\r\n* `PS C:\\Temp> atom 'C:\\Temp\\foo bar\\foo\\'`\r\n* `PS C:\\Temp> atom \"C:\\Temp\\foo

Reproduce\r\n\r\nOpen Atom on a project directory that contains saved state:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ atom .\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem also occurs in safe mode. Using `--clear-window-state` suppresses it for that run, but it reappears immediately afterward.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Atom should launch successfully and display the tree view and background tips, restore saved state, and so on.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Window remains blank and there's an exception in the console.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100% on workspaces that were serialized recently (within the last day or so), never on workspaces that I haven't opened for a while.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nMacOS Sierra, 10.12.4\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ atom --version\r\nAtom    : 1.18.0-dev-5d57ecb8c\r\nElectron: 1.3.15\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n$ apm --version\r\napm  1.18.1\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.13\r\ngit 2.12.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI'd guess that this is just an incompatible change in the way that editor state is serialized to IndexDB, but I'm suspicious because it reoccurs after a `--clear-window-state`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14381/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14380","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14380/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14380/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14380/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14380","id":227343883,"number":14380,"title":"How

This overrides the exclusion of `*.cc` and `*.h` sources from the packaged app for this specific, odd case, allowing native dependency builds to succeed again.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nI tried to find a way to modify the existing regexp to prevent `EXCLUDED_PATHS_REGEXP` from matching this file, but unfortunately JavaScript doesn't support negative lookbehind and I was concerned about the risk of an explosion in computational complexity with the workarounds.\r\n\r\nI also considered splitting the `*.(cc|h)` exclusion rule into more specific exclusion rules, but there are too many of each that we _do_ want to exclude (all of the others; currently about 375 *.cc and 1000 *.h files). That would also cause a maintenance issue when adding any new dependencies with native components in the future.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nThat's where the build scripts are :wink:\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nAttempting to build native dependencies on Windows machines fails with an error containing the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nc1xx : fatal error C1083: Cannot open source file: 'C:\\Users\\foo\\AppData\\Local\\Atom x64\\app-dev\\resources\\app\\apm\\node_modules\\node-gyp\\src\\win_delay_load_hook.cc': No such file or directory [C:\\Users\\foo\\Documents\\GitHub\\xyz\\node_modules\\keytar\\build\\keytar.vcxproj]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese builds now succeed.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nJuggling multiple inclusion and exclusion patterns with precedence can quickly gets confusing (see: .gitignore files).\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nMy previous attempt to fix this was in atom/apm#716, merged in atom/atom#14331.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14366","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14366/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14366/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14366/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14366","id":226675952,"number":14366,"title":"Prepack

Observe that the snippet dropdown appears after a delay\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Snippet dropdown should open immediately\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Snippet dropdown takes a few seconds to appear\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Every time I use a snippet in a large file\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ atom --version\r\nAtom    : 1.16.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\n$ apm --version\r\napm  1.16.1\r\nnpm  3.10.5\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.12\r\ngit 2.11.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI can understand why autocomplete in general would take a while to load, but snippets shouldn't need to read the whole file to load -- they should appear immediately.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14365/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14364","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14364/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14364/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14364/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14364","id":226650019,"number":14364,"title":"\"Search in Directory\" no longer appears in the context menu when right-clicking on project tree entries","user":{"login":"hughlomas","id":187210,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/187210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughlomas","html_url":"https://github.com/hughlomas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughlomas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughlomas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughlomas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughlomas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughlomas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughlomas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughlomas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughlomas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughlomas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-05-05T18:09:24Z","updated_at":"2017-05-05T18:16:47Z","closed_at":"2017-05-05T18:16:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/187210/25758275/e7a10e6c-319b-11e7-900f-1ce71eb31308.png)\r\n\r\nSomewhere in the last 2-4 weeks, my \"Search in directory\" option has disappeared from the context menu on the project tree.\r\n\r\nThis featured heavily in my workflow, I use it constantly throughout the day.

I have found if you cut all the text out of the file, then past it into a new file, scroll to the top, it will highlight correctly (but not once you save and open the file again). The only way I can get the highlight to work consistently is when I physically shrink the file to ~50k lines.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. [First Step]\r\nOpen a large C, Java, XML, or some other syntax aware file (150,000 lines or more)\r\n2. [Second Step]\r\nNote that the text has no syntax highlighting even though the correct language is detected\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\nWhen opening a large text files (150k+ lines) the text is highlighted correctly based on the selected syntax.\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\nAll text has no highlighting, only when shrinking the file to ~50k lines did highlighting start to function again.\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\n100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n1.17.0-Beta4 c64\r\nWindows 7

response.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4182","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507404130","x-github-request-id":"9655:366E:6F2EEF:EA54BE:59D927C3","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=50>;
