#7337.\n\nWe caught another :bug: related to #7320. Basically, when multiple `TextEditorComponent`s were created for the same instance of `TextEditor`, we weren’t removing some event listeners from the recycled gutter DOM node which, in turn, had multiple handlers listening and acting when a certain event was fired (e.g. `onMouseDown` and `onMouseClick`).\n\n@maxbrunsfeld: could you give this a shot and look out for the bug you reported? I am quite confident this is going to fix it but I’d like to have your feedback as well. :bow: \n\nI think this is likely to be the last fix for all the so-called “global state” issues that we have encountered over the last days. However, I won’t feel very confident about changing these areas of the code without introducing new :beetle:s. I like @jssln's proposal :bulb: of having a `1:1` correspondence between `TextEditorComponent` and `TextEditor` and I think we have two ways of handling it:\n1. When panes are split, always create a new instance of `TextEditor`.\n2. When `TextEditorElement` is detached, avoid creating a new instance of `TextEditorComponent` and simply use the previous one.\n\n@nathansobo: this PR can be merged without addressing the above proposal, but I am curious about your :thought_balloon: on this. My two cents are that we should go for 2), as it’s kinda pointless to always create new instances as proposed in 1). I am sure, though, that there are good reasons for that behavior to exist  and it’d be great if you could share your thoughts about them.\n\nThanks everyone! :bow: \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7341/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7340","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7340/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7340/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7340/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7340","id":89505168,"number":7340,"title":"strange behaviour when pasting","user":{"login":"PierBover","id":226483,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/226483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBover","html_url":"https://github.com/PierBover","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBover/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBover/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBover/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBover/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBover/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBover/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBover/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBover/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBover/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":84710475,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/editor-rendering","name":"editor-rendering","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-06-19T08:29:49Z","updated_at":"2017-08-29T18:52:14Z","closed_at":"2017-08-29T18:52:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm copying and pasting text from a PDF.\n(I will post images because it seems the Github's textarea also converts characters)\n\nThis is the text on the PDF\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/226483/8249657/33c6e550-1632-11e5-917c-edc6457a8eae.png)\n\nLook at the word `podría`.\n\nThis is what I get when pasting in Sublime\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/226483/8249663/3f3f8ff4-1632-11e5-9427-91a66723f379.png)\n\nThis is what I get when pasting in Atom\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/226483/8249678/680fd8d0-1632-11e5-80a0-f519f7b0d599.png)\n\nThe problem is that this character  `i´` that you can see in Sublime breaks something in Atom.

So I don't need automatical update checking at each startup.\nIt consumes about 2MB of data. Since I restart atom a lot, it piles up quickly.\n\nI searched through the forum, looked around settings, but could not find anything similar of disabling update checking.\n\nCan an option be added to the settings page? It would be greatly appreciated. \nSometimes, when I'm home, does not bother much this additional internet usage.\n\nI hope you appreciate my feature request.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7339/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7338","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7338/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7338/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7338/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/7338","id":89488631,"number":7338,"title":"styles.less examples","user":{"login":"simurai","id":378023,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/378023?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simurai","html_url":"https://github.com/simurai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simurai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simurai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simurai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simurai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simurai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simurai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simurai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simurai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simurai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-06-19T07:11:16Z","updated_at":"2015-06-19T16:10:19Z","closed_at":"2015-06-19T16:10:16Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/7338","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/7338","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/7338.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/7338.patch"},"body":"This PR adds some examples (commented).

This made us experience _orphaned line numbers_, caused by two instances of `LineNumberGutterComponent` mutating `.line-numbers` at the same time.\n\nThis is a typical race condition which I would normally address by understanding and possibly locking the correct order in which operations should happen. However, I believe in this situation we shouldn’t actually care about ordering at all, since I think views should be kept “local”, thus avoiding to expose them to the world and/or reusing them across other views (either accidentally as in this case or on purpose).\n\n@jssln @nathansobo: I assume the `ViewRegistry` came into play because it was handy to get the view straight from `atom.views.getView`. If this is the use case and I am not missing something, we may expose a method under `TextEditorElement` which, in turn, would interrogate `TextEditorComponent` to fetch the related DOM node.
