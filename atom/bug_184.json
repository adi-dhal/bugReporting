When creating files sometimes I get the name wrong and, for whatever reason, I'd rather delete the file and re-create than just rename it. Atom adds friction by prompting \"Are you sure you want to delete the selected item?\" – this gets old. There's no real consequence for deleting an empty file, so the prompt would be great to remove. Adjusting the behavior would also be great when removing files you don't end up needing after scaffolding a project.\n\nTLDR: the prompt gets to be a bit much.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10313/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10312","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10312/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10312/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10312/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10312","id":125317351,"number":10312,"title":"OSX: Inconsistent cmd+D behavior","user":{"login":"jmeas","id":2322305,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2322305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeas","html_url":"https://github.com/jmeas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":98445015,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/mac","name":"mac","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":19,"created_at":"2016-01-07T04:00:14Z","updated_at":"2016-12-06T15:49:13Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system**: OSX El Capitan v10.11.2 (15C50)\n**Atom**: v1.3.2\n\n**Description of problem**:\n\n`cmd+D` does not always work as intended. The expected behavior is that it selects the next instance of the highlighted occurrence. For instance, if `sandwiches` is selected, and `cmd+D` is entered, then the next instance of `sandwiches` should be selected. There should be no circumstance where any text aside from `sandwiches` become highlighted after typing `cmd+D`.\n\nSometimes – seemingly when `D` is pressed too quickly after pressing `cmd` – Atom gets confused and highlights _up until_ the next instance of the text.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n\n**Update: [Follow the steps here](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10312#issuecomment-170034796)**\n# \n\nHere are some screenshots:\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nTo reproduce these screenshots, press `cmd` and then `d` with at least 100ms of timing between them.\n\nImage 1: this is after pressing `cmd+D` once:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2322305/12161839/ac9c2d48-b4c8-11e5-891c-3ceb684ef8f0.png)\n\nImage 2: this is after pressing `cmd+D` twice:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2322305/12161828/932d761e-b4c8-11e5-9e89-ffa9dc4c552f.png)\n\n**Unexpected behavior**\n\nTo reproduce these screenshots, type `cmd` and then `D` very quickly. A non-scientific guess is to try to get it down to ~5ms between them.\n\nImage 1: this is after pressing `cmd+D` once:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2322305/12161857/cbb63c3c-b4c8-11e5-8968-28c4dc6a7d58.png)\n\nImage 2: this is after pressing `cmd+D` twice:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2322305/12161860/d3600ea4-b4c8-11e5-90d9-64c93db8d820.png)\n\nIs this a bug, or is it intention behavior where it functions differently when the keys are pressed too closely together? I've used Sublime Text for years, and I use this hotkey so frequently that I type it very, very quickly; ST behaves the same way whether there's an appreciable delay or not.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10311","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10311/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10311/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10311/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10311","id":125316506,"number":10311,"title":"OSX: Crashes when closed as full screen app","user":{"login":"jmeas","id":2322305,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2322305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeas","html_url":"https://github.com/jmeas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmeas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-01-07T03:47:42Z","updated_at":"2016-01-07T04:01:32Z","closed_at":"2016-01-07T03:58:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9584 is once again a problem in 1.3.2.

If not, repeat steps 1 through 4 until it does (shouldn't take more than a few tries!)\n\nCrash data [here](https://gist.github.com/jmeas/e52b40212d2b57dcd375)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10310","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10310/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10310/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10310/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10310","id":125310745,"number":10310,"title":"Handle EAGAIN and ETIMEDOUT errors on open/save","user":{"login":"kuychaco","id":7910250,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7910250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuychaco","html_url":"https://github.com/kuychaco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuychaco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuychaco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuychaco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuychaco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuychaco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuychaco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuychaco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuychaco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuychaco/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-01-07T02:47:40Z","updated_at":"2016-01-08T00:49:18Z","closed_at":"2016-01-08T00:49:14Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/10310","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10310","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10310.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10310.patch"},"body":"Also extract helper for mapping error codes to friendly messages\n\n/cc @kevinsawicki \n\nCloses #10299 \nCloses #10300 \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10310/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10309","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10309/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10309/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10309/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10309","id":125304960,"number":10309,"title":"Problems with accented characters in syntax highlighting","user":{"login":"lee-dohm","id":1038121,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1038121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm","html_url":"https://github.com/lee-dohm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2016-01-07T01:55:39Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T19:11:29Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T19:11:29Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"It looks like we may have a problem with accented characters with syntax highlighting.

in the project pointing to directories within the project cause atom to get stuck in a loop (case 1) or report duplicate search matches (case 2).\n### Case 1\n\nSay there are the following entries in the project:\n\n```\ndir1\ndir1/dir2\ndir1/dir2/file1\ndir1/dir2/symlink1 -> ..\n```\n\nThe `symlink1` points to the parent directory. This creates a loop in the project filesystem and causes several issues:\n- Atom gets stuck in a loop when reindexing the project. The reindexing will never finish\n- When searching for matches within the project atom will again get stuck in a loop and keep reporting matches in the same files over and over\n### Case 2\n\nConsider the following project entries:\n\n```\ndir1\ndir1/dir2\ndir1/dir2/test.txt\nsymlink1-> dir1/dir2\n```\n\nIn this case the `symlink1` points to a project directory further down the three. As a result the file test.txt is encountered **twice** when traversing the filesystem tree and any search matches will be reported twice.\n### Fix\n\nI think this should be handled cleanly by checking the target of symlinks in the project. If they point to other directories within the project they should not be followed when traversing the tree during reindexing/searching.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10286/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4968","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"BFE4:366F:BE9D27:1738E66:59D929DF","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=185>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=183>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"7f63ee5df0793687dc84f7f2b0f6762b\"","status":"200 OK"}}
