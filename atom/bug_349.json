me start off by describing my use case. I'm writing a package where the version number is prominately displayed in the main view. Something like \"Welcome to this awsome Atom Package v-X.Y.Z\". In order to find the version number of the installed package, I have to write out this really long ugly line of code:\n\n``` coffeescript\nversionNum = atom.packages.getLoadedPackage('my-package').metadata.version\n```\n\nand it got me thinking that it would be really nice to have a free variable that refers to _this_ package, much like the node free variable `module` refers to _this_ module. So instead of that long, ugly monster I could instead write:\n\n``` coffeescript\nversionNum = package.metadata.version\n```\n\nwhich would mean _my_ package's version number or even better:\n\n``` coffeescript\nversionNum = package.version\n```\n\nPlease note that this is not a vital request, and I can live without it. I simply think it would be convenient and much more elegant. Also note that I have no idea where to even begin implementing this, or if it's even possible to begin with. But I can't be the only one using my own package's metadata progmatically, so if it is possible, hopefully there's someone out there who could make it happen and make life on us package developers just that much easier! :smile: \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5318","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5318/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5318/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5318/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5318","id":56042806,"number":5318,"title":"Cursor disappears after switching tags (Awesome WM)","user":{"login":"muchweb","id":7157049,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7157049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muchweb","html_url":"https://github.com/muchweb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muchweb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muchweb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muchweb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muchweb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muchweb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muchweb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muchweb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muchweb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muchweb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-01-30T14:57:45Z","updated_at":"2017-08-10T14:45:24Z","closed_at":"2017-08-10T14:45:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Cursor disappears after switching between tags in [Awesome WM](http://awesome.naquadah.org/).\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

example if i am at the middle of the list, i have to scroll again and find my position. \n\nAlso another thing is that if i click (in the same menu) multiple times the \"Settings' button, i can not

I updated Atom from 0.175.0 to 0.176.0 yesterday. Today, I noticed a new folder in my Start Menu Programs called \"Paul Betts\". The folder is empty. The creation time is just 13 seconds after the creation of the folder atom/app-0.176.0/resources and before the creation time of the rest of the files in atom/app-0.176.0.\n\nThis seems like a bug. In case it's relevant, I do remember closing Atom during the update process.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4803","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"D61F:2B9A:3EBD9A:8BC3D5:59D92C2D","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=350>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=348>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"ae4117b68d0ff56f2e2ad496120de9b4\"","status":"200 OK"}}
