Reproducible - also in safe mode.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. open atom\n2. create some text in \"untilted\"\n3. close atom\n\n**Expected behavior:** being prompted to save - or at least creating an autosave\n\n**Actual behavior:** file contents are lost\n### Versions\n\nOS: Mac OS X 10.11.4\n\n```\n$ atom --version\nAtom    : 1.7.1\nElectron: 0.36.8\nChrome  : 47.0.2526.110\nNode    : 5.1.1\n\n$ apm --version\napm  1.9.2\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.10\ngit 2.8.1\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11510/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11509","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11509/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11509/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11509/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11509","id":149142714,"number":11509,"title":"Did a lot of hard work on installation, finally the editor keeps crashing soon i open/create a new file on arch linux.

allows newer listeners to be prioritized based on when they are added.\nThis is useful as more recent contexts often have to be resolved first.\n\nFor example, when `core:move-down` is called in a `find-and-replace` editor, it will go through its history.\nBut when an autocompletion listener is added later, it should move through the possible autocompletions.\n\nI am curious how this use case is handled in for plain DOM listeners, as they will always be called [in the order of their registration](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents/#event-flow). It seems possible that listeners can be backed up, and restored after the context is resolved. I'm not very experienced in front-end development though, do you guys have insight?\n\ncc @nathansobo \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11506/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11505","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11505/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11505/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11505/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11505","id":148985234,"number":11505,"title":"Fedora Dependency Problem for 1.7 Upgrade, nothing provides libffmpeg.so()(64bit) needed by atom-1.7.0-1.*.x86_64","user":{"login":"johnthomas00","id":4084713,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4084713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnthomas00","html_url":"https://github.com/johnthomas00","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnthomas00/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnthomas00/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnthomas00/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnthomas00/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnthomas00/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnthomas00/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnthomas00/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnthomas00/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnthomas00/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":176631763,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/installer","name":"installer","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":97577987,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/linux","name":"linux","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-04-17T19:24:03Z","updated_at":"2016-04-18T11:38:13Z","closed_at":"2016-04-18T11:38:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n\nNone, \n### Description\n\nCannot install Atom 1.7 on Fedora 22 or 23, but can install 1.6.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n```\n[root@dev02 ~]# dnf install atom-1.7.0-1.fc22.x86_64\nLast metadata expiration check performed 0:52:20 ago on Sun Apr 17 07:09:52 2016.\nError: nothing provides libffmpeg.so()(64bit) needed by atom-1.7.0-1.fc22.x86_64\n(try to add '--allowerasing' to command line to replace conflicting packages)\n\n[root@dev02 ~]# dnf --allowerasing install atom-1.7.0-1.fc22.x86_64\nLast metadata expiration check performed 0:52:36 ago on Sun Apr 17 07:09:52 2016.\nError: nothing provides libffmpeg.so()(64bit) needed by atom-1.7.0-1.fc22.x86_64\n\n[root@dev02 ~]# dnf list ffmpeg\nLast metadata expiration check performed 0:52:45 ago on Sun Apr 17 07:09:52 2016.\nAvailable Packages\nffmpeg.x86_64                                               2.6.8-1.fc22                                               rpmfusion-free-updates\n```\n\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]\nAtom 1.7 to install\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\nAtom 1.7 install fails\n### Versions\n\nSee above\n# reference:\n\nMentioned the problem at the link below.

At the very least all associated files should have a generic file icon separate from Atom's stock icon.\n\nIdeally all file type icons should be changeable depending on the file extension thus conveying a visual difference between for example a .txt and a .py by visual recognition; however, starting with a separate generic associated file type icon would be significantly better than what is in place as of 1.7.\n\nAn example of files associated with Atom 1.7 on Windows 10 desktop:\n![2016-04-17](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11142424/14588863/ae1dd722-0499-11e6-9cc1-e2a70c7fa6c2.png)\n\nAn example of the proposed generic file icon next to an Atom shortcut:\n![2016-04-17 1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11142424/14588947/0566d16c-049c-11e6-8b75-60e7aa33cc1c.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11504/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11503","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11503/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11503/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11503/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11503","id":148946546,"number":11503,"title":"Editor freezing when editing a markdown file","user":{"login":"puranjayjain","id":5458094,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5458094?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/puranjayjain","html_url":"https://github.com/puranjayjain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puranjayjain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puranjayjain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puranjayjain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puranjayjain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puranjayjain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puranjayjain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puranjayjain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puranjayjain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puranjayjain/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-04-17T12:21:10Z","updated_at":"2016-04-19T07:10:49Z","closed_at":"2016-04-19T07:10:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nFreezing or crashing of the editor when editing links or images in a markdown file (*.md)\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.

more verbosity to the output or figure out what is making it so slow.\n\nAtom is not that big of a text editor and i've seen plenty of applications including but not limited to \"Sublime Text\" build and install faster and all of them actually show output of them doing something.\n\nIt gets annoying every time i go to update arch and atom has an update because of this.\n\nI'm tempted to just uninstall atom and never install it

After the updater failed to work (still/again) I manually downloaded and installed Atom using this process:\n- Download from atom.io\n- unzip\n- close Atom\n- drag new Atom to Applications, replace existing Atom with new \n- relaunch Atom\n\nWhen I relaunched Atom the unsaved files I was working on were gone replaced with two blank files, and the saved file I had open was replaced with a blank file. I tried to look in the editor cached files to recover what I had been working on. Unfortunately one of those files is a little more than 1.6 MB, which when I try to load it and scan through in Atom, it chokes. It doesn't seem to be able to handle the very file that it created -- making recovering from the failed update process all the more painful.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Try to update\n2. Manually update when first step fails\n3. Open newly updated Atom\n4. Try to review cache since previously opened files were blown away\n5. Cry because one of the files is too big to deal with in Atom\n6. File issue on Github\n\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]\nOne of two things...maybe three:\n1. Atom actually updates itself like the menu option suggests is possible (despite it never working)\n2. Atom would recover from cache files \n3. Atom could actually handle a file that it generates so a user can manually recover from problems\n\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\n1. Updater failed\n2. Manual install blew away open files from previous session\n3. Can't manually retrieve prior work because .atom/storage editor cache file is larger than what Atom can handle (my file is 1621797, not sure what the limit is for Atom stability).\n### Versions\n\nI am on OS X version 10.11.4. I started with Atom version 1.6, and updated to 1.7 (1.7.1 to be exact).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11497/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11496","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11496/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11496/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11496/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11496","id":148858295,"number":11496,"title":"Atom crashes on startup from finder.

Rose/AppData/Local/atom/bin/../app-1.7.1/resources/cli/atom.sh: line 2: /c/Users/Kevin: No such file or directory\n```\n\nThe code in [/resources/win/atom.sh](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/resources/win/atom.sh) was recently shortened by @damieng, if I replace this newer code with the previous version, then it runs fine from Git Bash. \n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. In Git Bash on Windows (10), navigate to any directory\n2. Run `atom .`\n3. Observe the error\n\n**Expected behavior:** It should open Atom at the specified directory.\n\n**Actual behavior:** It errors out.\n### Versions\n\n```\nAtom    : 1.7.1\nElectron: 0.36.8\nChrome  :
