reproduction steps described below. problem appears related to the hover bubble over files  in the file tree._\n\nAfter some time of running `atom --safe` (1.10.2) it crashes. The nature of the crash is that the window remains open but when I resize the window the canvas does not update. I am no longer able to scroll in the tabs open or do anything with atom other than forcefully quit it. The system I am running on in Ubuntu 14.04.4LTS with Gnome 3.12.2.\n\nI've had this issue consistently through various atom versions. Because atom does an okay job in recovering the previous open state, and because most of my projects involve git which means I'm saving a lot, it doesn't bother me too much. But often I'll get frustrated and update my atom (compiling from latest stable) in hopes it is fixed. \n\nI would love to figure out how to reproduce this but I haven't found it yet. It seems to happen only when I'm working on a tree of files, and have a few tabs open at least. Then after about 10 or 15 minutes I will be scrolling and it will lock up.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12832/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12831","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12831/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12831/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12831/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12831","id":180372260,"number":12831,"title":"Fixes

search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\n`window:focus-pane-on-right` and `window:focus-pane-on-left` don't work when the window is greater than the breakpoint between the `minimum` and the largest `even` tab sizes when the setting is `auto`.\n\nIt seems to only be a problem with `-left` and `-right`, `focus-pane-above`, `focus-pane-below`, `focus-previous-pane`, and `focus-next-pane` work fine in all sizes.\n\nSmall window, minimum-style tabs, `window:focus-pane-on-left/right` works correctly:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3939997/18998792/be070904-86ff-11e6-915e-b2e19926d400.png)\n\nWide and short window,
