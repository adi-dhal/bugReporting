on #11897. This is the [actual diff](https://github.com/atom/atom/compare/mkt-use-apm-with-npm3-and-node-4...as-circle-ci).\n\nThis pull-request tries to supplant Travis and replace it with CircleCI. After trying it out for a while, the build process seems more reliable and faster as well. Moreover, if CircleCI enables parallelism for macOS containers in the future, we could be able to speed up our test suite very easily.\n\nRight now the build fails because of some flaky tests that are not related to CircleCI at all (i.e. Janky and Travis fail too for the same specs), but overall I think we might be able to 🚢 this and let it run alongside Travis for a while so that we can assess how well it performs. If after the test-drive everything looks good, we can :fire: Travis and use CircleCI only.\n\nThis is the plan we're on right now:\n\n![screen shot 2016-07-20 at 20 47

consider **Growth** too if we run out of minutes.\n\n/cc: @nathansobo @iolsen @atom/core

search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nWhen editing a text file, any changes including new lines that are applied using the redo option appear to be coerced to LF endings instead of CRLF endings as one might expect on Windows. I've only noticed this recently while editing files with some linter packages, which immediately highlight inconsistencies with line endings.\n\nSee my screen capture below for an illustration of this problem.\n\n![redoproblem](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2031402/16984950/df07d2ce-4eaf-11e6-8c07-4e8b300ec2a9.gif)\n\nI had a quick poke around the Atom code base but nothing stood out to me. It's probably something to do with the `text-buffer` dependency.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nEnabling invisible characters will help visualise this problem.\n1. Open a new file in Atom and add some lines using the <kbd>ENTER</kbd> key.\n2. Undo all the lines (i.e. <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd>).\n3. Redo all the lines (i.e. <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>Y</kbd>).\n\n**Expected behavior:** All the line endings inserted by the redo action should use CRLF endings instead of LF.\n\n**Actual behavior:** Redo actions insert LF endings.\n### Versions\n- Atom 1.8.0\n- apm 1.9.2\n- Windows 10 Pro\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12198/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12197","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12197/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12197/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12197/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12197","id":166424419,"number":12197,"title":"Uncaught

is `undefined`, which breaks Atom on startup (at least on Mac). Interesting that it is `undefined` even when I explicitly set this variable in `.bashrc`.\n\nThe patch is a one-liner for simplicity:\n- It checks, if `ATOM_HOME` is falsy. If it is:\n  - It checks if `HOME` is truthy. If it is:\n    - It sets `ATOM_HOME` to `path.join(HOME, '.atom')`.\n  - Otherwise it sets it to an empty string.\n\nThe description above dwarves the code.\n\nI don't know what caused the problem, because I saw it before intermittently, but recently I updated node to 6.3.0, and Mac to 10.11.6. The combined change made the problem persistent.\n\nBefore debugging the code I tried to reinstall Atom 1.8.0, and 1.9.0-beta0 &mdash; both fail the same way (`undefined` is passed to `path.join()`).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12195","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12195/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12195/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12195/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12195","id":166375229,"number":12195,"title":"linux ubuntu build failure on gyp_main.py no such option --no-parallel","user":{"login":"darrenleeweber","id":240623,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/240623?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/darrenleeweber","html_url":"https://github.com/darrenleeweber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darrenleeweber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darrenleeweber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darrenleeweber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darrenleeweber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darrenleeweber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darrenleeweber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darrenleeweber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darrenleeweber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darrenleeweber/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98407029,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/build-error","name":"build-error","color":"f7c6c7","default":false},{"id":97577987,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/linux","name":"linux","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-07-19T16:27:36Z","updated_at":"2016-07-20T17:33:24Z","closed_at":"2016-07-20T17:33:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"``` sh\n$ git checkout $(git describe --tags `git rev-list --tags --max-count=1`)\nNote: checking out 'v1.8.0'.\n... snipped ...\nHEAD is now at f89b273...

Save As...\n2. Select a directory using the Save As.. Dialog expansion. Navigate to a chosen directory\n3. Press Save\n4. File is saved at the same level as the selected directory and NOT within it.\n\n**Expected behavior:** Save to the proper directory selected within the Save As.. dialog\n**Actual behavior:** Only seems to happen when the Save As.. Dialog is expanded to allow Finder like navigation.  Saves at the same level as the directory selected and not within the directory itself. \n\nHave gotten it to work by not expanding and using the default Finder toolbar directory pull down only. Tricky. Workaround is of course to move the file in Terminal or the Finder etc..\n### Versions\n\nmacOS Sierra Public Beta 10.12 Beta (16A238m)\n\natom --version\nAtom    : 1.8.0\nElectron: 0.36.8\nChrome  : 47.0.2526.110\nNode    : 5.1.1\n\napm  1.9.2\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.10\ngit 2.8.4\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12193","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12193/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12193/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12193/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12193","id":166316871,"number":12193,"title":"Atom UI elements with selectable text don't respect system default copy/paste keys","user":{"login":"petetnt","id":7641760,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7641760?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/petetnt","html_url":"https://github.com/petetnt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petetnt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petetnt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petetnt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petetnt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petetnt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petetnt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petetnt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petetnt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petetnt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-07-19T12:17:41Z","updated_at":"2016-07-24T11:00:34Z","closed_at":"2016-07-24T11:00:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nSome UI elements with text in Atom can be selected/highlighted and then copy pasted. Some examples of this are some of the texts in the Settings-menu and errors messages on Linter panels.\nThe usually use-case for me is taking an error message spat out by the linter (or other checker) from a panel and Googling it.  On MacOS, unlike on Windows, the default copy-paste combinations are `cmd`-based, `cmd-c`, `cmd-v` (while the Windows ones are `ctrl-c, ctrl-v`). However, the only way to copy selected text from Atom UI is through the `ctrl`-key, despite `cmd` being the preferred key on MacOS.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. On MacOS X...\n2. Open Settings\n3. Highlight some text\n4. Copy the text with `cmd-c` and paste it\n5. Copy the text with `ctrl-c` and paste it\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n\nClipboard contains the copied text during step 3, nothing is copied during step 4.\n\n**Actual behavior:** \n\nNothing is copied to clipboard during step 3, text is copied during step 4.\n### Versions\n\nMacOS X El Capitan (10.11.6)\nAtom    : 1.8.0\nElectron: 0.36.8\nChrome  : 47.0.2526.110\nNode    : 5.1.1\napm  1.9.2\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.11\ngit 2.8.2\n\nQuite a minor issue, but still an annoyance. 🐈 \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12192","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12192/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12192/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12192/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12192","id":166139069,"number":12192,"title":"Upgrading to Electron v1+?

Any guidance for writing specs for this would be super helpful.\n### TODO:\n- [ ] Write specs\n- [ ] Cleanup, including old commented code and extra space around new code\n- [ ] Decide if the `home` and `end` keys should act on the screen or buffer line.

changes that haven't been saved is overlapping the file name. This causes some very annoying problems:\n- it's so easy to miss that I sometimes forget to save file changes\n- makes it harder to read the file name\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/452219/16897895/4a615ca8-4b76-11e6-9ee5-d7113052c26b.png)\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. make a change to any file\n2. try reading the text in the tab, you'll see a blue dot on top of the text\n\n**Expected behavior:** Blue dot should have a margin so you can clearly see it and also be able to clearly read the file name.\n\n**Actual behavior:** Blue dot is on top of the text, making it not obvious which files have changed, causing me to forget to save file changes.\n### Versions\n\nAtom    : 1.8.0\nElectron: 0.36.8\nChrome  : 47.0.2526.110\nNode    : 5.1.1\n\nMac OSX El Capitan\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4110","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507404130","x-github-request-id":"AEE8:3670:9F2379:199CB77:59D928E1","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=122>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=120>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"6a195cf5a4a47fba01b1dd62d8de25f3\"","status":"200 OK"}}
