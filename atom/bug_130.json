If you have automatic updates turned on, it will also re-download the update every few hours, wasting bandwidth.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Log in as a non-administrator on OS X.\n2. Install Atom anywhere, it doesn't matter if you use `~/Applications` or `/Applications`\n3. Let Atom check for updates\n4. Click \"Restart and install\" in the About dialog.\n\n![swzuygqf](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/769083/15906276/24eb541e-2d86-11e6-80c1-d7c44712572a.png)\n\n**Expected behavior:** Atom should close, and a dialog should prompt you for administrator credentials if necessary. The Atom.app bundle should be replaced.\n\n**Actual behavior:** Nothing happens when you click the button. If you have automatic updates turned on, Atom will also re-download the update every few hours, wasting bandwidth.\n\n![z2040ies](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/769083/15906335/5bdec348-2d86-11e6-8b09-a59853f4999c.png)\n### Other Notes\n\nLogging in as an administrator is not a solution. It's unwise to use OS X daily as an administrator, and many IT policies forbid it. Other apps correctly prompt you to provide administrator credentials when you want to make system changes.\n\nPutting Atom in `~/Applications` doesn't fix this issue, but it's also not a long-term solution if fixes are made. Users should be able to install Atom in `/Applications`.\n\nThe GitHub Desktop app has this exact same problem, and I've reported it to them twice. It may be an issue with ShipIt.\n### Versions\n\n```\n$ atom --version\nAtom    : 1.7.4\nElectron: 0.36.8\nChrome  : 47.0.2526.110\nNode    : 5.1.1\n```\n\n![ae95mneo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/769083/15906232/fe7c3f32-2d85-11e6-8f69-3589dda8b391.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11939/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11938","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11938/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11938/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11938/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11938","id":159241685,"number":11938,"title":"MSI installer starts and then disappears Windows 7","user":{"login":"amaltson","id":167443,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/167443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaltson","html_url":"https://github.com/amaltson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaltson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaltson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaltson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaltson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaltson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaltson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaltson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaltson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaltson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":176631763,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/installer","name":"installer","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":62363277,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":15,"created_at":"2016-06-08T18:42:01Z","updated_at":"2017-02-06T19:12:28Z","closed_at":"2016-06-13T20:28:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n\nFor more information on how to write a good [bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) or [enhancement request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\nWhen I try installing using the MSI fir Atom 1.8 (which became available since #11087), I find that the installation starts and then disappears.

Click on Atom's Dock icon, Launchpad icon or the .app file within the Finder\n### Versions\n\n``` shell\nAtom    : 1.8.0\nElectron: 0.36.8\nChrome  : 47.0.2526.110\nNode    : 5.1.1\n```\n\n``` shell\napm  1.9.2\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.10\ngit 2.7.4\n```\n\n```\nOS: Latest OS X (10.11.5)\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11937/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11936","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11936/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11936/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11936/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11936","id":159156867,"number":11936,"title":"atom -d command does not open text editing window","user":{"login":"KiYugadgeter","id":7894040,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7894040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KiYugadgeter","html_url":"https://github.com/KiYugadgeter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KiYugadgeter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KiYugadgeter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KiYugadgeter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KiYugadgeter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KiYugadgeter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KiYugadgeter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KiYugadgeter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KiYugadgeter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KiYugadgeter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":171329633,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-reproduction","name":"needs-reproduction","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-06-08T12:57:29Z","updated_at":"2016-10-10T18:15:52Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\n\n`atom -d` command does not open text editing window.\n\nI attempted to execute `atom -d .` to develop package.\nBut Atom does not open editing window \nWhen executed it, There is a just atom application menu and Quit sub menu like attached picture.\n\n![2016-06-08 20 11 21](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7894040/15894760/a3ea1b38-2dc2-11e6-9ace-471fb4f239ca.png)\n##### Expected behavior\n\nOpen Editing window with dev mode\n### Versions\n\nOS X 10.11.5\nAtom 1.8.0\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11935","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11935/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11935/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11935/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11935","id":159149955,"number":11935,"title":"Uncaught Error: Cannot read property 'object' of undefinedTypeError: Cannot read property 'objec...","user":{"login":"jplatte","id":951129,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/951129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplatte","html_url":"https://github.com/jplatte","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplatte/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplatte/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplatte/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplatte/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplatte/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplatte/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplatte/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplatte/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplatte/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-06-08T12:21:24Z","updated_at":"2016-06-08T13:38:04Z","closed_at":"2016-06-08T13:38:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This just popped up a few minutes after starting and using Atom today, I don't think I did anything special.

Description\n\nIf Atom is running and an update is downloaded and ready to be installed, opening a new file from an external application (like Finder) will fail - rather than opening that file in the existing application instance a new instance of the application starts up, without any files. Worse yet, after closing the second instance and restarting the initial one the update is not installed and has to be downloaded again.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Install Atom 1.8.0-beta4\n2. Run Atom\n3. Go to Atom menu, click \"Check for Update\" if that menu item is present.\n4. Wait for the update to be downloaded (Atom menu will show something like \"Restart to install Atom 1.9.0-beta0\") but don't restart Atom.\n5. Run from command line: `open -a 'Atom Beta' ~/.atom/init.coffee`\n\n**Expected behavior:** A new tab is opened in the running Atom instance, allowing to edit the Atom init script.\n\n**Actual behavior:** A second Atom instance starts up, without any tabs. Closing that instance and restarting the initial instance won't install the update, the update has to be downloaded again instead.\n### Versions\n\nAtom 1.8.0-beta4 on Mac OS X 10.11.5.

When a PHP multi-line comment goes over a PHP environment tag, Atom appears to malfunction. It ignores the comment in the new PHP environment (and, in my instance, commented out all the javascript code subsequent to closing the comment as well). Additionally, all subsequent PHP code appears in italics.\n\nI tried changing the grammar to HTML from PHP and it fixes the comment issue but, of course, the PHP code is not colored so it doesn't serve the

Open Developer Tools\n\n**Expected behavior:**\nAll files are correctly identified to their proper location, meaning _all_ package files are identified and shown properly in the Source tree.\n\n**Actual behavior:**\n\nFiles that are recognized as under the `file://` domain are split between `C:\\Users\\User Name\\` and `C:\\Users\\User%20Name\\`.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/427137/15867853/f6bb0b12-2c99-11e6-9b4b-01e6b20e9a5f.png)\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/427137/15867871/108ab6c8-2c9a-11e6-8b66-316d1564aab7.png)\n\nThe files under `file://C:/Users/Landon%20Abney/` also exhibit the odd behavior that the path is duplicated, but a few package's path's aren't:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/427137/15868263/f29ca048-2c9b-11e6-87e6-27d11e8beff8.png)\n\nWhile many files are only listed under the `(no domain)` categorization.\n\nOne group of these are shown as `/C:/Users/Landon%20Abney/.atom/packages/...`:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/427137/15867942/556b99f6-2c9a-11e6-814a-5b19323f585c.png)\n\nThe majority of files are shown as `C:\\Users\\Landon Abney\\.atom\\packages`:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/427137/15867998/92d16fe6-2c9a-11e6-9dca-b113a7f3e618.png)\n\nI would expect _all_ of these files to be recognized as coming from the same folder, and shown properly in the Source tree. Often when working on a package the source file isn't listed under the `file://` domain, and I have to hunt through the huge list of `(no domain)` files, if it's even listed there.\n### Versions\n\nOS: Windows 10 x64 Enterprise\n\n`atom --version`:\n\n``` text\nAtom    : 1.9.0-beta0\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\n```\n\n`apm --version`:\n\n``` text\napm  1.10.0\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.11\ngit 2.7.4.windows.1\nvisual studio 2015\n```\n\nNote that I've seen this since before Atom hit 1.0 till current, so it's been a long standing issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11923/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11922","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11922/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11922/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11922/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11922","id":158967118,"number":11922,"title":"Commenting selection comments out entire line instead of selection","user":{"login":"jsgv","id":2798097,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2798097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsgv","html_url":"https://github.com/jsgv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsgv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsgv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsgv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsgv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsgv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsgv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsgv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsgv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsgv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-06-07T16:26:39Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:07:06Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [ ] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode)?\n- [ ] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [ ] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [ ] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [ ] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [ ] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n\nFor more information on how to write a good [bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) or [enhancement request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\nI only want to comment out a selected part of a line.
