For example, ${1}4 does not result in the first backreference being followed by a 4, but rather the literal string \"${1}4\". \r\n\r\nThe last paragraph (two sentences) in the first section at the following link describes the behavior I expect:\r\nhttp://www.regular-expressions.info/replacebackref.html\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a value in the editor like \"1, 2, 3\"\r\n2. Press CTRL+F and turn on regex search\r\n3. Paste in the pattern (\\d, \\d, )\\d, and make sure it matches correctly\r\n4. Now, in the replace field past in the pattern ${1}4\r\n5. Note that the highlighting looks like all literals, with no highlighting to indicate a backreference (remove the curly braces to see what I mean, then replace them.)\r\n6. Do the replace, note the unexpected result of \"${1}4\"\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** When I have a backreference that needs to be immediately followed by a number literal, I expect wrapping the backreference's number in curly braces to isolate it from any immediately following number literals. For example, ${1}4 should give me the value of the first backreference followed immediately by a 4.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** replace string ${1}4 replaces the found text with the literal string \"${1}4\", completely ignoring the backreference, when curly braces are added.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Every attempted use of this pattern.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.16.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI don't have any packages installed which should have anything to do with this part of Atom's functionality.

https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen dock was hidden, it **force** focus on workspaceCenter's active pane( Ignore original focus ).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14143/commits/73f04fdaed30b774d1f5134a1df05eba30202aab\r\n\r\nSo hiding dock means \"focus is taken away from originally focused element\".\r\nI want hiding dock not cause focus change unless hidden dock was originally focused.\r\n\r\nWhen package-author try to implement action which hide dock and want to keep focus on `select-list` or mini-editor.\r\nIt's unnecessarily difficult since hiding dock force focus to workspaceCenter's active pane.\r\n\r\n- Actual situation\r\n\r\nIn my [project-folder](https://atom.io/packages/project-folder) package, user can add/remove multiple project with keeping focus on select-list.\r\nThe `space` key in `select-list` is keymapped as \"confirm and continue\" action which confirm current item on select-list and keep focus on `select-list` so that user can continuously remove/add project folder.\r\nFrom atom v1.17(which introduced dock), when project paths get emptied, tree-view destroy itself and tree-view's dock is hidden.\r\nAt this point, **focus is taken away from select-list to workspaceCenter's active pane** and `blur` event is fired on `select-list`'s element. which cause `cancel()` of select-list.\r\nI don't want `cancel`, or `blur`, just want focus kept on originally focused `selec-list`'s mini-editor.\r\n\r\nThis is new issue from atom v1.17.0. Was not problem in v1.16.0.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/t9md/atom-project-folder/issues/9#issuecomment-298679687\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Set following commands and keymap.\r\n\r\n- `init.coffee`\r\n\r\n```coffeescript\r\natom.commands.add 'atom-workspace',\r\n  'user:focus-taken-away-repro': ->\r\n    for dir in atom.project.getPaths()\r\n      atom.project.removePath(dir)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `keymap.cson`\r\n\r\n```coffeescript\r\n'.select-list':\r\n  'space': 'user:focus-taken-away-repro'\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Start atom-beta(v1.17) with at least one project-folder listed on tree-view.\r\n3. `cmd-t` to start `fuzzy-finder`.\r\n4. type `space`, which invoke `user:focus-taken-away-repro` comands.\r\n\r\n- In atom 1.16.0: focus remain in `select-list`'s mini-editor.\r\n- In atom 1.17.0-beta3: focus taken away from `select-list` to activePane.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\n\r\nWant atom not take away original focus when dock was hidden.\r\nWant keep focused on `select-list`'s mini-editor.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\n\r\nOriginal focus was taken away from `select-list` to activePane.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\n\r\n100%, allways.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```coffeescript\r\nAtom    : 1.17.0-beta3\r\nElectron: 1.3.14\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14338/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14337","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14337/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14337/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14337/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14337","id":225648082,"number":14337,"title":"Strange background-color artifacts in TextEditor in Atom 1.17-beta4","user":{"login":"jgebhardt","id":632968,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/632968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgebhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/jgebhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgebhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgebhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgebhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgebhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgebhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgebhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgebhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgebhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgebhardt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-05-02T10:00:42Z","updated_at":"2017-05-02T10:49:54Z","closed_at":"2017-05-02T10:49:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nIn Atom 1.17-beta4, the text editor shows strange background color artifacts when Atom is shown on an external monitor:\r\n\r\n![atom-1-17-screen-issue](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/632968/25613273/8c0502de-2f25-11e7-9673-e1cf9d09e69d.gif)\r\n\r\nThese artifacts don't show up on my macbook's retina display; only on the external monitor (In the gif above, you can see me dragging the Atom window from my retina screen to the external monitor.\r\n\r\nThe issue goes away if I remove either the `transform` or `background-color` properties of the 6-line `<div/>` element in the text editor.

https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWhenever I seach in my project files, there is a strange and incorrect difference between a normal 'Find in project' search and entering a project folder to search into.\r\n\r\nI have two project folders in Atom. When search and leave the path field empty, it is done in about a second and returns an X number of search results.\r\nWhen I then search within the directory of just one of the projects, the search takes much longer and returns many more results. What i looks like (but there are too many files and folders to be able to make sure), is that when I search within a project directory, it also searches within greyed out subfolders, so folders that are supposed to be excluded from the search. The option 'Exclude VCS ignored paths' is ticked.\r\nI have a .gitignore and .dockerignore file in the project root directory that lists the subfolders that should be ignored.\r\n\r\nI updated Atom to the newest version (1.16.0) and removed all packages that aren't there by default. I checked with someone else who is using 1.12.0 and he has the same issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14331","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14331/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14331/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14331/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14331","id":225334586,"number":14331,"title":"Bump
