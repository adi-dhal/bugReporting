Type `alt-n` in the editor with the keybindings-resolver open to see for yourself.\n\nOne possible fix for this is to set type `password` on the hidden input since these characters can't be typed into password fields in this manner and so the key events go back to \"normal\" and `alt-e` and `alt-n` can now be used again in keymaps.\n\nThis PR adds a preference `editor.enableI18nSupport` that toggles the hidden input between `text` and `password`.\n\nOther ideas/approaches are welcome, this is just an initial stab at it after @benburkert reported not being able to use `alt-n` in his keymaps file.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1290","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1290/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1290/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1290/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/1290","id":24132322,"number":1290,"title":"Cannot Install the gfm Plugin","user":{"login":"benburkert","id":77,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/77?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benburkert","html_url":"https://github.com/benburkert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benburkert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benburkert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benburkert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benburkert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benburkert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benburkert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benburkert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benburkert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benburkert/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-12-11T19:45:25Z","updated_at":"2013-12-11T20:06:30Z","closed_at":"2013-12-11T20:06:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It looks like atom is trying to install an old version of the gfm plugin.\n\n![screen shot 2013-12-11 at 11 46 43 am](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/77/1727277/b803716c-629c-11e3-8636-b644059beb47.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1290/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1289","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1289/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1289/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1289/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/1289","id":24127057,"number":1289,"title":"Save tree view scroll position on close","user":{"login":"garand","id":82437,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/82437?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garand","html_url":"https://github.com/garand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-12-11T18:28:53Z","updated_at":"2013-12-11T18:31:24Z","closed_at":"2013-12-11T18:31:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"What do you think about adding the ability to save the scrolled position in the tree view when Atom is closed, so when that project is reopened you are back to where you were when you closed?
