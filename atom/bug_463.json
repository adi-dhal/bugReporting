It deletes the newline AND the folded code. Probably not the behavior most people are expecting (caught me by surprise the first time).\n\nCurrently, I can't reproduce exactly this behavior. However, deleting folded code does not work as I would expect either -- when I press backspace, not only is the folded code deleted, but also the whole line containing the ellipsis representing the folded code as well.\n\nHere's a GIF of me pressing backspace once to delete some folded

The same is true for `alt-shift-up` and `alt-shift-down`.\n\nAs far as I can tell, SublimeText3 uses `alt-up/down` to jump to the beginning/end of the line, and `shift-alt-up/down` to select to the beginning/end of the line. Might this be a good default in Atom as well?\n\nThis behavior of jumping to the beginning of the line is currently bound to `ctrl-a` (`editor:move-to-beginning-of-line`), while `cmd-left` jumps to the beginning of the physical line (`editor:move-to-first-character-of-line`).\n\nHowever, `ctrl-shift-a` doesn't select to the beginning of the logical line but to the beginning of the physical line (`editor:select-to-first-character-of-line`), which is the same thing as `cmd-shift-left`.\n\nIn other words, if `ctrl-shift-a` was consistent with `ctrl-a`, it would select like this:\n\n![screen

We can optimize the shit out of our JS, but if we read from the DOM after touching it, performance is going to suck. If we want to be fast. It's critical that we batch all reads and writes in a reflow-minimizing way, and the less we access the DOM the better. The DOM needs to be treated with kid gloves.\n\nAnother hurdle in optimization is the complexity of the original editor implementation. To minimize DOM updates, we had a headache-inducing region invalidation routine. Combine that with lots of ad-hoc DOM updates for various aspects of the view that have evolved over time, and it's pretty difficult to reason about the behavior of the editor.\n\nThe editor is one of Atom's most essential components. It needs to be as fast as possible, and we can't afford to get mired in complexity every time we work on it.\n### How React.js helps\n\nThe core idea behind React is that you express the state of the DOM at a given point of time declaratively, allowing React to compute a minimal set of DOM updates based on a diff with the previous state. This is great, because one source of confusion in the old editor is the sequence of actions that update the DOM. Now that's all abstracted away. React makes DOM programming similar to traditional server-side web programming, where you get to assume a page refresh in between view states.\n\nRewriting the editor view was also an opportunity to make other improvements, which were easier thanks to the simplicity afforded by starting with a clean slate and using a superior tool:\n- Autoscroll is handled entirely in the model layer, which will avoid expensive DOM reads when moving the cursor and allow us to implement page up, page down, etc as methods on the model.\n- The model is now aware of the display width of characters, allowing pixel positions to be computed in the model and paving the way for optimization of extremely long lines. We'll be able to break long lines into smaller chunks and only render what's on screen, just like we only render what lines are on screen in the vertical direction. This is only possible if we know how wide characters are. This also paves the way for soft-wrap based on pixel dimensions rather than wrapping at a specific number of characters, which will address a number of issues with soft wrap with non latin characters. It would also make Atom viable as a more general word processor with first class support for variable width fonts.\n- The \"plate glass window\" called the overlayer has been removed. It was present to capture mousewheel events so velocity scrolling didn't jerk to a halt when the target of the scroll event was removed. We now delay removal of lines until after mousewheel events stop firing. Now users can access tokens directly with the DOM inspector, and a bunch of complexity involved in relaying click events between layers can be removed.\n- The hidden input is now absolutely positioned relative to the scroll view rather than the content inside it and is never allowed to stray out of the visible bounds of the scroll view. This eliminates code required to avoid Chromium's native autoscroll behavior when the input is focused.\n- Detecting of insertion of accented characters has been simplified.\n### Deployment plan\n\nChanging editor rendering is a pretty huge deal and there are bound to be issues. This editor view has a superior design for the future, but the existing editor view has been battle tested and is stable. We need feedback about the new editor without forcing people to use it, so my plan is to initially deploy it behind a feature flag. The new editor will only be used if `core.useReactEditor` is true.\n\nSteps:\n- [x] Get the test suite green with the feature flag turned off. There were a few small changes to the model layer that affect the original editor that need to work.\n- [ ] Get the test suite green with the feature flag turned on. This ensures that shims are in place to at least support Atom's default packages. We can learn what else is missing based on feedback from users.\n- [x] Do an optimization pass on the React editor. I satisfied myself that React could be fast enough early on, but then added a bunch of features without paying attention to performance. I don't want to roll it out until it's faster than what exists, so we provide an incentive for people to try it.\n- Merge this PR, with some features missing\n- Implement additional features in subsequent PRs\n  - Invisibles\n  - IME character composition support\n  - fold decoration\n  - page up / page down / etc\n- Make the react editor the default when it's stable\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1862","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1862/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1862/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1862/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/1862","id":31350664,"number":1862,"title":"Serialization
