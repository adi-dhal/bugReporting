I still think this is the \"correct\" behaviour, but in 1.0.3, this changed - so, the consumer was activated, commands were ran, and **only then** the packages that provided that service were being fired.\n\nIs this expected?

In the most recent release of Nuclide (v0.0.26), there are 17 such packages to install: https://github.com/facebooknuclideapm/nuclide-installer/blob/v0.0.26/lib/config.json.\n\nThe way `nuclide-installer` works is that it starts up and then runs `apm install` for each package in that `config.json` file. On my machine (where `~/.npm` was already populated with all of the dependencies used by these packages), it took `nuclide-installer` 6 minutes to install all 17 Atom packages and the resulting `~/.atom/packages` directory was 903M! That's enormous! This is bad for several reasons:\n- 903M is an order of magnitude more disk space than is necessary if dependencies could be de-duped.\n- The installation process is much slower than it has to be.\n- Much more JavaScript code has to be loaded at runtime.\n- I suspect that the JavaScript in `~/.atom/packages` is not loaded as efficiently as the JavaScript in `/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar`, putting third-party code at even more of a disadvantage.\n\nI suspect that the only thing I can do right now without any changes to Atom is have `~/.atom/nuclide-installer` create a special directory structure under itself. Maybe something like:\n\n```\n~/.atom/nuclide-installer/node_modules/\n~/.atom/nuclide-installer/node_modules/atom_packages/\n```\n\nwhere npm packages common to multiple Nuclide Atom packages would be written to `~/.atom/nuclide-installer/node_modules/` (obviously there could only be one version per common dependency) and then each Atom package would be in its own directory under `~/.atom/nuclide-installer/node_modules/atom_packages/`. Under that scheme, only an npm dependency that already had an entry under `~/.atom/nuclide-installer/node_modules/` would also have to exist under `~/.atom/nuclide-installer/node_modules/atom_packages/<ATOM PACKAGE>/node_modules` if a different version were required.\n\nOnce everything was in place, `nuclide-installer` would run `apm link` for each entry in `~/.atom/nuclide-installer/node_modules/atom_packages`.\n\nWhile I'm [rubber ducking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging), I would probably add another directory of indirection so that the directory structure would be parameterized by version number:\n\n```\n~/.atom/nuclide-installer/v0.0.26/node_modules/\n~/.atom/nuclide-installer/v0.0.26/node_modules/atom_packages/\n```\n\nThis way, `nuclide-installer` could be writing out v0.0.27 and would not switch over until all of the files were in place.\n\nThis is really important for Nuclide, so I'm willing to hack this into `nuclide-installer`, but it would be nice if there were a way for Atom to support this natively so that others could also provide package bundles efficiently for Atom.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8217/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8216","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8216/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8216/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8216/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8216","id":99015372,"number":8216,"title":"Browser preview inside Atom?","user":{"login":"santosh","id":1515991,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1515991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/santosh","html_url":"https://github.com/santosh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santosh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santosh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santosh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santosh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santosh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santosh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santosh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santosh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santosh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-08-04T17:09:17Z","updated_at":"2017-08-29T18:52:08Z","closed_at":"2017-08-29T18:52:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Atom is based on Chromium, right?

There,\n\nI have projects which encoding is utf8 and iso88591, and is annoying having to change the default encoding for reading and writing files in Core Settings, each time I switch from one project to another. I think besides Core Settings, the project folder itself should have a \"Project Settings\" that should overload the Core Settings. One of the setting in Project Settings should be Default Encoding for the project files. May be some other project specific settings could be present in Project Settings. Well, this is just an insight. You guys know what is better for Atom. Any way I love Atom as it is. \n\nBest regards,\n\nMiguel Mello\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8211","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8211/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8211/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8211/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8211","id":98950398,"number":8211,"title":"Atom crashed multiple times","user":{"login":"francdore","id":2630949,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2630949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/francdore","html_url":"https://github.com/francdore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francdore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francdore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francdore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francdore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francdore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francdore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francdore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francdore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francdore/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":62363277,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2015-08-04T11:50:52Z","updated_at":"2015-10-09T21:59:45Z","closed_at":"2015-10-09T21:59:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I've installed Atom recently and it has crashed multiple times.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2630949/9060015/cc62389a-3aaf-11e5-8fc8-bc630a929b23.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8211/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8210","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8210/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8210/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8210/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8210","id":98944358,"number":8210,"title":"Normal mode switches to different keyboard layout","user":{"login":"atd","id":26228,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/26228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/atd","html_url":"https://github.com/atd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-08-04T11:10:55Z","updated_at":"2015-08-04T11:34:46Z","closed_at":"2015-08-04T11:28:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'am using a Spanish keyboard layout.

Previously, as soon as selections started overlapping we merged them, but this led to unintuitive behavior when dragging with the mouse, where existing selections would snap to the current pointer location. It also created inconsistencies when the first selection was wordwise or linewise.\n\nIn this PR, we defer selection merging during dragging. You can drag a new selection to overlap an existing one, then change your mind and still leave the old selection intact. As soon as you release the mouse button, selections are merged as normal.\n\n![selection-merging](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1789/9052814/584d7860-3a29-11e5-8255-09fe72a04433.gif)\n\nThis is the first time we've ever allowed overlapping selections to

I assume this is happening because Atom is trying and failing to open the link externally, but I don't know how that works so I don't know if I need to set a default browser or if I'm missing a helper program or something else.
