Both steps lead to the same result so I will describe symptoms for observed behavior when building 32-bit Atom locally as this may be more pristine state.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. I was able to successfully compile Atom on Ubuntu using `script/build --create-debian-package` command. DEB package is successfully created and build is clean with no errors. \r\n2. Installing Atom.deb - success, no issues\r\n3. Atom --version\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.13.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** I would expect editor to launch\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Atom editor is dark (black), nothing can be seen within text area. Title bar shows \"Welcome Guide -- Atom\" but whole text area is black and nothing can be seen. Moving mouse within the text area changes cursor pointer from time to time so it seems that pane boundaries within the text area are properly recognized but not properly rendered (everything is black as mentioned above). Attempt to close all tabs through menu option (File\\Close Tab) does not solve the issue, while tabs are closed which can be observed by text changing within Atom's window Title bar, but whole text area continues to be black\\dark.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Every time Atom is launched\r\n\r\n## Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.13.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThis is how Atom screen looks like:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8009260/21987607/87f2e806-dc04-11e6-975e-8d956088c3c1.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13635/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13634","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13634/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13634/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13634/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13634","id":201036986,"number":13634,"title":"Losslessly optimize all images with imgult.","user":{"login":"ryanpcmcquen","id":772937,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/772937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpcmcquen","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanpcmcquen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpcmcquen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpcmcquen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpcmcquen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpcmcquen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpcmcquen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpcmcquen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpcmcquen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpcmcquen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanpcmcquen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true},{"id":97577987,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/linux","name":"linux","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":150782082,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wontfix","name":"wontfix","color":"ffffff","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":20,"created_at":"2017-01-16T14:43:53Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T23:38:39Z","closed_at":"2017-01-20T00:11:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/13634","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13634","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13634.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13634.patch"},"body":"https://imgult.github.io\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Ryan P.C.

This interferes with the typing of legitimate proper code in many languages. In C/C++ the impact is less serious because a line is *usually* terminated with a `;` (but midstatement line breaks are possible and sometimes used for formatting, so this could also lead to user frustrations). However, for languages where an identifier can regularly be at the end of the line, as for example in lua or when assigning one variable to another in Python, this is potentially very wrong and frustrating.\r\n\r\nThe autocompletion should be configured in a way that if the user doesn't actively interact (e.g. choose something out of the list with active key presses) it will never mess up what the user typed, unless it is most likely a proper useful macro (e.g. \"pdb\" in Python) which is intended to be expanded in special ways.\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

It's something that a [package](https://atom.io/packages/no-title-bar), theme or `styles.less` could provide when `custom-inset` is used.\r\n\r\nAnother example with the `tool-bar` package taking the role of a \"title bar\":\r\n\r\n![title-bar-custom 2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378023/18807177/79a71afc-827b-11e6-8bc9-68ec69338e59.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nNeeds access to the `BrowserWindow` API.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\n- Provides more title-bar variations.\r\n- Themes can adapt to the different title-bar modes. Before there was no way to tell.\r\n- Allows packages/themes to customize even further, like hide the title-bar but keep the traffic lights.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nWhen hiding the title-bar, managing the window needs to be done with the keyboard or from the menu. Dragging the window needs to be done with the status-bar. Not really a drawback since it's a choice and not the default.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nThis PR contiues from https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10208 (Hide title bar on OS X) and https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11790 (already merged).\r\n\r\n/cc @atom/feedback @atom/design ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13616/reactions","total_count":106,"+1":57,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":29,"confused":0,"heart":20}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13615","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13615/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13615/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13615/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13615","id":200757275,"number":13615,"title":"GIRL Emoji with the FITZ-3 modifier rendering as two separate characters","user":{"login":"TELunus","id":2502960,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2502960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TELunus","html_url":"https://github.com/TELunus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TELunus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TELunus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TELunus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TELunus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TELunus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TELunus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TELunus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TELunus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TELunus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-01-13T23:28:18Z","updated_at":"2017-01-14T01:02:49Z","closed_at":"2017-01-14T01:02:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[Description of the issue]\r\n\r\nThe GIRL Emoji with the FITZ-3 modifier, which renders correctly according to the Unicode specification in Chromium as a FITZ-3 GIRL , renders as default GIRL emoji followed separately by a square showing the FITZ-3 skin tone.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n0. Have an Emoji font that supports the Fitzpatrick modifiers installed.  I'm using Google's Noto Color Emoji from https://noto-website-2.storage.googleapis.com/pkgs/Noto-hinted.zip\r\n1.

Description of the Change\r\n\r\nCurrently atom creates two buffers for the same file if passed paths use difference case for disk drive letter, e.g. `d:\\file.txt` and `D:\\file.txt`\r\n\r\nThis change ensures that the absolute path always has disk drive letter in uppercase. \r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nThe other place where this fix could be applied is [findBufferForPath](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/project.coffee#L331) function. However the used function [resolvePath](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/project.coffee#L229) already has some path normalization code, so I think this is the best fit.\r\n\r\nActually Windows interpreters `file.txt` and `File.txt` as the same file. Maybe it makes sense to extend this patch and make Atom to do the same on this operation system, but I'm not sure because it can be file system specific. Any suggestions are welcome!\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nI believe the current behavior of the editor is wrong for Windows users, so it makes no sense to create a plugin to fix that.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nThe main benefit I would like to get is the ability to click on parsed backtrace in my terminal emulation app (ConEmu). Right now it works, but atom opens second buffer for the same file because it doesn't normalize disk drive letter.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nThe possible drawback is some broken tests, but I've checked that and it seems everything works.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nHere is the related issue #8221. It's not exactly about my problem, but it's very near.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13612","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13612/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13612/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13612/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13612","id":200687418,"number":13612,"title":"Arabic sentences between double quotations are rendered out of the quotations","user":{"login":"MMayla","id":4347943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4347943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMayla","html_url":"https://github.com/MMayla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMayla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMayla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMayla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMayla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMayla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMayla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMayla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMayla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MMayla/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":84710475,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/editor-rendering","name":"editor-rendering","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":505038679,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-01-13T17:42:57Z","updated_at":"2017-01-29T12:29:47Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

Description\r\n\r\nAfter starting build 1.13.0-beta8 and clicking ```Restart and install``` to update to build 1.14.0-beta0 Atom restarted but prompted me to update again. Without checking the version number I clicked update again and just after doing so noticed I was on the version I intended to update to. The one listed that I was now going to update to was a lower version number. This resulted in the Atom shortcut in Windows being changed from ```AppData\\Local\\atom\\Update.exe --processStart \"atom.exe\"``` to ```AppData\\Local\\atom\\atom.exe``` and breaking the shortcut as that file does not exist.\r\n\r\nTo temporarily workaround this issue I had to restore both my Atom install folder and my desktop from a windows shadow copy created before the Atom update took place. Then disable the auto download and update within Atom to prevent it from entering the broken state again.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Launch Atom 1.13.0-beta8\r\n2. Select Restart & Install Update to update to Atom 1.14.0-beta0\r\n3. Once Atom restarts observe it prompts a notification to update to a \"newer\" version again\r\n4. Observe the \"newer\" version, which appears to be listed as the current stable branch version, is lower than currently installed version (if Atuomatically download updates is checked, in my case it is) observe that Atom will begin to download the \"new update\" automatically.\r\n5. Select Restart and install\r\n6. Once Atom restarts, exit it and observe the Windows shortcut is now directing to an invalid path\r\n7. Go to where Atom's shortcut is now pointing to: ```AppData\\Local\\atom\\atom.exe``` and observe that there is no atom.exe and both versions of Atom are listed in the directory.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Atom does not incorrectly prompt to update to an older version of Atom that ends up breaking your install.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Atom fails to install the older version and breaks the current install.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** The initial issue happened once (unable to recreate the situation to do it again. However, selecting to \"update\" when prompted to after directly running Atom from ```AppData\\Local\\atom\\app-1.14.0-beta0\\atom.exe``` results in the same failed update and continues to keep the install broken.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nAtom    : 1.14.0-beta0\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\nWindows 7 Ultimate 64bit\r\n\r\n### Additional
