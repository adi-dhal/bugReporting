The code will hit an infinite loop when presented with a certain directory structure:\n\n```\nalpha/\n  foo/\n    bar.txt\nbeta/\n  foo/\n    bar.txt\n  something-else/\n    bar.txt\n```\n\nIf all three `bar.txt` files are opened in Atom, when the third one is opened and `getLongTitle()` is called, it will hit an infinite loop.\n\nThe method takes the file path for the tab being opened, and compares it to the others already open. If it finds colliding base filenames (i.e. `bar.txt`), and attempts to find the first parent directory that differs by stripping off one segment from each file path, until it finds a unique directory. The problem is that by comparing the paths this way, one level at a time, you can have one path collide at one level, and another path collide at a different level, resulting in no unique directory for all paths being found.\n\nThe problem becomes apparent when we step through the logic while attempting to open `beta/foo/bar.txt` with the other two `bar.txt` files already open.\n1. All three file paths are selected for disambiguation since they all have the same basename (`bar.txt`).\n2. Strip one layer off (now at `beta/foo`), and check if the lowest directory is unique. It's not, because of `alpha/foo/bar.txt` (whose path is now `alpha/foo`, colliding with `beta/foo`).\n3. Strip off another layer (now at `beta`), and check if the lowest directory is unique. It's not, because of `beta/something-else/bar.txt` (whose path is now `beta`).\n4. Repeat, but now all the paths are the same because we hit the root of the project.\n\nEventually, all the paths are reduced to `/`, and the while loop gets stuck.\n\nHappy to try submitting a PR, but feels like this could use some discussion about what the actual goal is. I'm not sure the current algorithm would work, even with a different implementation. There is no single ancestor directory that could disambiguate all three file paths, so it seems like a different approach is needed.\n\nHere's a zip with a reproduction project:\n[atom-bug-repro.zip](https://github.com/atom/atom/files/61770/atom-bug-repro.zip)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10060/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10059","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10059/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10059/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10059/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10059","id":122125506,"number":10059,"title":"Proposal: Add an \"API Changes\" section to change log information in Releases","user":{"login":"lee-dohm","id":1038121,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1038121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm","html_url":"https://github.com/lee-dohm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":274751644,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/proposal","name":"proposal","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-12-14T20:35:48Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T19:09:10Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T19:09:10Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"With the huge glut of new information in the change log on Releases, it is unclear for package authors where they can go to get information specifically on API changes.

Create the following folder and file structure outside of Atom. Files do not need to have any content.\n\n```\nroot/\n      folder1/ \n             sub1/\n                  file.txt\n             sub2/\n                  file.txt\n      folder2/ \n             sub1/\n                  file.txt\n             sub2/\n                  file.txt\n```\n\n**2**. Open the folder `root` in Atom using File -> Open Folder\n**3**. Open any three files by clicking on them in the Tree View\n\n**Expected behavior:**\nAtom opens up all three files in their own tabs\n\n**Observed behavior:**\nAtom editor stops responding on trying to open the third file, a few seconds later a dialog pops up asking to wait or close. Wait never resolves so closing is the only cause of action. The developer console shows no exception.\n\n**Atom version:** 1.3.1\n**OS and version:** Windows 7\n\n**Installed packages:**\nNone\n\n**Additional information:**\nThis bug occurs on a fresh install of atom with zero config changes or package installs.\nI believe this has something to do with how the tabs are named with files that have the same name. \nWhen opening two files you get one of the following tab names\n- `folder1\\...\\file.txt` | `folder2\\...\\file.txt`\n- `sub1\\file.txt` | `sub2\\file.txt`\n\nHowever when you open a third file, Atom doesn't know how to name the 3rd tab because if it tries to follow one of the formats above, it will have two files that have identical tab names. e.g.\n\n`folder1\\...\\file.txt` (Meaning folder1\\sub1\\file.txt) | `folder2\\...\\file.txt` (Meaning folder2\\sub1\\file.txt) | `folder1\\...\\file.txt` (Meaning folder1\\sub**2**\\file.txt)\n- Problem can be reproduced in safe mode: **Yes**\n- Problem started happening recently, didn't happen in an older version of Atom: **Yes**\n  - Can't reproduce this problem in 1.2.3 Windows 7 or 1.2.0 Linux Debian. It's worth noting that 1.2 formats the tab names differently (`file.txt - folder1\\sub1`)\n- Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: **Yes**\n- Problem happens with all files and projects, not only some files or projects: **Yes**\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10043/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10042","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10042/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10042/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10042/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10042","id":121934665,"number":10042,"title":"\"Atom\" crashs on open minify css file.","user":{"login":"dslpp056193","id":11080873,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11080873?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dslpp056193","html_url":"https://github.com/dslpp056193","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dslpp056193/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dslpp056193/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dslpp056193/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dslpp056193/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dslpp056193/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dslpp056193/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dslpp056193/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dslpp056193/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dslpp056193/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-12-13T18:11:41Z","updated_at":"2015-12-13T18:26:25Z","closed_at":"2015-12-13T18:26:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Then i opened minify css file (where all code in one line), \"atom\" crashs.\n## Versions\n- **Atom:**       1.3.1\n- **Atom-Shell:** \n- **OS:** Windows 7\n- **Misc**\n  - apm  1.4.1\n  - npm  2.13.3\n  - node 0.10.40\n  - python \n  - git \n  - visual studio \n\n---\n\n<small>This report was created in and posted from the Atom editor using the package `bug-report` v0.7.1.</small>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10042/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10041","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10041/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10041/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10041/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10041","id":121905959,"number":10041,"title":"Cannot delete files through atom on Windows","user":{"login":"elebumm","id":6053155,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6053155?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elebumm","html_url":"https://github.com/elebumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elebumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elebumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elebumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elebumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elebumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elebumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elebumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elebumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elebumm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true},{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-12-13T07:55:15Z","updated_at":"2015-12-13T16:33:34Z","closed_at":"2015-12-13T16:33:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I am currently running Windows 7.
