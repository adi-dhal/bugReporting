Prerequisites\n- [X] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode)?\n- [X] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [X] Did you check the [debugging guide](flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [X] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [X] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [X] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n\nFor more information on how to write a good [bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) or [enhancement request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\nThis is very likely a very low priority issue caused by a race condition in the deduper (@lee-dohm  theory) but it is possible (if you are fast enough) to open the same tab multiple times (I managed twice at least).\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open tab from tree view by clicking on it.\n2. Immediately after step 1 press enter.\n3. Observe you have 2 tabs of the same file open, in the case where pending pane items option is true you have the one pending tab and one confirmed tab, without pending pane items option you have 2 confirmed tabs.\n\nFor me this was easier at my work computer and with the first tab that i open in that atom window, as the first tab takes several seconds to load you have a bigger window to execute the 2nd step.\nAt home I can reproduce it but I have to try for a long time.\n\n**Expected behavior:** Atom to switch to already open tab at all times.\n\n**Actual behavior:** Atom opens multiple (at least 2 confirmed) tabs of the same file.\n### Versions\n\n1.6.X\nWindows

I do not see where in the settings this can be removed, since it is visually unappealing and distracting.\n\nThis problem is reproducible, both in and out of safe mode.

Lee asked me to try in safe mode and to try after closing the application and deleting `~/.atom/storage`\n\ni've been seeing some strange behavior in atom (v1.6.2) the last 3 days on my mac(10.10.5) -- the editor starts overheating my laptop, cpu just gets overloaded.  Couldn't figure out what it was and today I long-clicked on the atom icon in my doc and I'm seeing this -- it shows that I have a bunch of buffers open, however, i do not have any buffers open at all.  Any idea how to reset this? I think this is causing the problem.\n\nHere's a link to the image I posted on slack: https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T043R3J9D-F0YAGBL8Z/pasted_image_at_2016_04_05_08_44_pm.png\n\nYou'll see a list of files that it says I have open. I have no files open.  I believe there is a connection between references to those files and the CPU spike.  Any suggestion how to kill those pointers would be awesome.\n\nI've also tried re-installing the application; this did not fix the issue.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\ni have no steps to reproduce.  This is happening when I open the editor to any file, any project, or even an empty file.  Just leaving the editor open without doing anything will cause the cpu to spike and the editor will become unresponsive and a force quit is required.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11378","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11378/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11378/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11378/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11378","id":146176861,"number":11378,"title":"Failed to load C:\\Users\\mohamads\\.atom\\keymap.cson","user":{"login":"msaiyaff","id":17147255,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/17147255?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaiyaff","html_url":"https://github.com/msaiyaff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaiyaff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaiyaff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaiyaff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaiyaff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaiyaff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaiyaff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaiyaff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaiyaff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaiyaff/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722939,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"e6e6e6","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-04-06T03:35:23Z","updated_at":"2016-04-06T13:05:28Z","closed_at":"2016-04-06T13:05:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"error message in atom - \n[stdin]:34:36: error: missing '\n  'Ctrl-alt-l': 'editor:auto-indent'\n                                   ^\n\nkeymap.cson file - \n# Your keymap\n# \n# Atom keymaps work similarly to style sheets.

See the\n# Debugging Guide for more information:\n# \\* https://atom.io/docs/latest/hacking-atom-debugging#check-the-keybindings\n# \n# This file uses CoffeeScript Object Notation (CSON).\n# If you are unfamiliar with CSON, you can read more about it in the\n# Atom Flight Manual:\n# https://atom.io/docs/latest/using-atom-basic-customization#cson\n\natom-text-editor':\n  'Ctrl-alt-l': 'editor:auto-indent'\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11377","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11377/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11377/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11377/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11377","id":146176456,"number":11377,"title":"Failed to load C:\\Users\\mohamads\\.atom\\keymap.cson","user":{"login":"msaiyaff","id":17147255,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/17147255?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaiyaff","html_url":"https://github.com/msaiyaff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaiyaff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaiyaff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaiyaff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaiyaff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaiyaff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaiyaff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaiyaff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaiyaff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msaiyaff/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-04-06T03:32:56Z","updated_at":"2016-04-06T03:36:03Z","closed_at":"2016-04-06T03:36:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [ ] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode)?\n- [ ] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [ ] Did you check the [debugging guide](flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [ ] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [ ] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [ ] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n\nFor more information on how to write a good [bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) or [enhancement request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\n[Description of the bug or feature]\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.

When the diacritic menu is used, there are two `textInput` events, with no `keypress` in between. Therefore, when no `keypress` has occurred just prior to a `textInput`, the editor model can select the previous character to be replaced by the new accented character.\n- Track a flag for `compositionstart` events. When a user is in IME mode, the diacritic menu cannot be used, so the editor can skip the backward selection.\n\nTest Plan:\n\nTested in a plaintext file.\n- Type Latin characters, verify proper character insertion.\n- Press and hold <kbd>a</kbd>. Diacritic menu appears. Select an option using the keyboard or mouse. Verify that the `a` is replaced by an accented `a`, with no extra characters.\n- Type test strings in Katakana, 2-Set Korean, Telex (Vietnamese), Simplified Pinyin. Verify that characters are inserted correctly while composing, and after committing strings.\n\ncc @ssorallen @nathansobo \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11368","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11368/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11368/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11368/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11368","id":145742326,"number":11368,"title":"Launching from Terminal with path argument doesn't restore previously open windows","user":{"login":"mcdado","id":898057,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/898057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcdado","html_url":"https://github.com/mcdado","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcdado/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcdado/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcdado/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcdado/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcdado/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcdado/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcdado/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcdado/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcdado/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-04-04T16:56:51Z","updated_at":"2016-04-23T18:05:20Z","closed_at":"2016-04-23T18:05:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When launching from command line tool `atom` with a path argument while the app isn't open, any previously open window will not be restored.\n\n**Reproduction Steps:**\n1.
