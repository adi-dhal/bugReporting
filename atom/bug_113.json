New editors (ie those that are opened after Atom loads the existing project) do.  In addition, closing the existing editors and reopening them will cause them to start showing indent guides.  I believe this started after the TextEditor extraction PR, though I'm not completely sure.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open Atom and add a project folder (making sure the indent guides option is enabled)\n2. Open some files\n3. Close Atom\n4. Open Atom again, making sure it restores the project folder and files added in step 1\n5. Note that no indent guides are shown\n6. Open a different file and note that indent guides are shown on that file only\n7. Close one of the existing files and reopen it and notice that indent guides are now shown on that file as well\n\n**Expected behavior:** Indent guides to always show if the option is enabled\n\n**Actual behavior:** Indent guides do not show on existing editors until they are reopened\n### Versions\n\n```\nAtom    : 1.11.0-dev-351bad4\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\n```\n\n```\napm  1.12.5\nnpm  3.10.5\nnode 4.4.5\npython 2.7.12\ngit 2.9.2.windows.1\nvisual studio 2015\n```\n\nWindows 10 x64.\n\n/cc @lee-dohm\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12450","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12450/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12450/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12450/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12450","id":171739351,"number":12450,"title":"Atom 1.9.8 freezes everytime when an opened large file gets updated under Windows 10","user":{"login":"bailuding","id":1885382,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1885382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bailuding","html_url":"https://github.com/bailuding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bailuding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bailuding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bailuding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bailuding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bailuding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bailuding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bailuding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bailuding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bailuding/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":171329633,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-reproduction","name":"needs-reproduction","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":52925411,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/performance","name":"performance","color":"d4c5f9","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2016-08-17T19:24:46Z","updated_at":"2017-02-27T16:22:19Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [ ] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [ ] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n\nFor more information on how to write a good [bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) or [enhancement request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\nI opened two files in Atom, one is 3MB large.

When instantiating an editor with this parameter, the `width` of the `<atom-text-editor>` element will be automatically adjusted to the width of its content (+ the width of the gutter, if present).\n\n![autowidth](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/17744937/27e4ed64-64aa-11e6-92cf-6214fcb32847.gif)\n\nSince we explicitly assign a `width` to text editors that have enabled `autoWidth`, there's no need to resort to CSS hacks on the parent component (e.g. `style.minWidth = '1em'`) or on the element itself (i.e. `display: inline-block`). This option will be off by default, meaning that editors will inherit the parent element's width, exactly like a `display: block` element. Because this will be an opt-in behavior it shouldn't introduce any regression and, thus, we might hot-fix stable and beta (respectively 1.9 and 1.10, as of this pull-request) with this new parameter.\n\n/cc: @nathansobo @maxbrunsfeld

we attempted to automatically determine whether the editor’s height should be based on the editor’s content or the height of its container. Unfortunately, DOM APIs are insufficient to make this determination in a complete way, leading to unpredictable behavior.\n\nThis PR deprecates the automatic determination of this behavior. By default, editors base their height on their content. If an editor has an explicit height assigned via its style or is positioned absolute with an explicit top and bottom, we disable the content-based height calculation and log a deprecation warning telling the user to assign `autoHeight` explicitly in the future.\n\nThis paves the way to add an `autoWidth` setting to address https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12441, which will default to `false` but be overridable in this same way.\n\nWe intend to move this PR through the entire release cycle because it's a pretty big change, then open a separate PR for the more additive `autoWidth` setting that we can hotfix to 1.9.x to fix Nuclide's issue without as much risk.\n\nTasks:\n- [x] Deprecate automatic auto-height determination and get tests green\n- [x] Ensure we only issue one deprecation warning per editor\n- [x] Add test coverage for auto-height property\n- [x] Add test coverage for deprecations\n- [x] Remove remaining deprecations from core specs\n- [x] Remove remaining deprecations from package specs\n- [x] Fix broken package specs\n\n/cc @atom/facebook @as-cii \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12445/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12444","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12444/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12444/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12444/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12444","id":171628377,"number":12444,"title":"Loading mouse cursor is displayed after running Atom","user":{"login":"aruseni","id":372098,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/372098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aruseni","html_url":"https://github.com/aruseni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aruseni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aruseni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aruseni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aruseni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aruseni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aruseni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aruseni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aruseni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aruseni/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":97577987,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/linux","name":"linux","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-08-17T10:49:49Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T19:10:37Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T19:10:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\n\nWhen I open Atom, loading/waiting mouse cursor is displayed for about 30 seconds.\n\n![loading](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/372098/17733561/ee9ff44c-647f-11e6-9d09-d354c077989a.png)\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.

Description\n\nIt would be great if the `atom-text-editor` element sized itself according to its contents. We rely on this behavior in Nuclide to provide syntax highlighting inside [type-hints](https://nuclide.io/docs/languages/flow/#type-hinting), which uses an atom-text-editor inside a marker overlay. This used to work fine in Atom ≤1.8.x, although it relied on the `min-width: 1em` trick documented in the init script below. In 1.9.x, `.lines` elements inside the atom-text-editor shadow DOM don't have an explicit pixel width set anymore, which causes this behavior to break.\n\nIdeally there would be an attribute that would make the text editor reliably auto-size itself according to its contents.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nUse the following init script (`init.js` in ~/.atom):\n\n``` es6\n'use babel';\n\nimport {TextBuffer} from 'atom';\n\nfunction setupTextEditor(props) {\n  const textEditorParams = {\n    buffer: props.textBuffer,\n    lineNumberGutterVisible: false,\n  };\n  const textEditor = atom.workspace.buildTextEditor(textEditorParams);\n  if (props.grammar != null) {\n    textEditor.setGrammar(props.grammar);\n  }\n  return textEditor;\n}\n\nasync function setup() {\n  const buffer = new TextBuffer('const f = {a: 123};'); // dummy JS code\n  const [jsGrammar] = atom.grammars.getGrammars().filter(g => g.name === 'JavaScript'); // hack to get JS grammar\n  const textEditor = await atom.workspace.open();\n  const range = textEditor.setText('test');\n  const marker = textEditor.markBufferRange(range, {invalidate: 'never'});\n  const datatipElement = document.createElement('div');\n  const floatingEditor = setupTextEditor({\n    grammar: jsGrammar,\n    textBuffer: buffer,\n  }); // floatingEditor is expected to size itself according to ints contents.\n  datatipElement.style.border = '1px solid red';\n  datatipElement.style.minWidth = '1em'; // hack to auto-size in 1.8.x and prior. Auto-sizing does not work in 1.9.x\n  datatipElement.appendChild(floatingEditor.getElement());\n  textEditor.decorateMarker(\n    marker,\n    {\n      type: 'overlay',\n      position: 'tail',\n      item: datatipElement,\n    },\n  );\n  return datatipElement;\n}\natom.packages.onDidActivateInitialPackages(setup); // wait for grammar package to activate\n```\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n1.8.x: The text-editor element (highlighted with red border) expands to fit its contents:\n<img width=\"327\" alt=\"screenshot 2016-08-16 18 28 15\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/632968/17721528/ad35a52e-63df-11e6-8ae3-03f6c8d9ee4c.png\">\n\n**Actual behavior:**\n1.9.x: text-editor element does not set its width; it is `0` by default (1em in the screenshot due to applying the `min-width: 1em` trick):\n<img width=\"455\" alt=\"screenshot 2016-08-16 18 28 34\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/632968/17721526/a9aaff3a-63df-11e6-8c86-c8fabfdc8dfe.png\">\n### Versions\n\nBroken in ≥ 1.9.x.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12440","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12440/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12440/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12440/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12440","id":171534638,"number":12440,"title":"Serialize active pane item using index instead of URI","user":{"login":"matthewwithanm","id":126263,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/126263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm","html_url":"https://github.com/matthewwithanm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-08-16T22:38:43Z","updated_at":"2016-08-19T17:02:33Z","closed_at":"2016-08-19T11:10:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/12440","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12440","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12440.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12440.patch"},"body":"Under the current behavior, which item is active won't be restored unless it implements `getURI()`.

 Just last week I started trying to use Atom on MacOS 10 (Yosemite), and my main interest right now is in the languages ruby and crystal.\n\nWhen Atom.app starts up, it creates a directory \"Atom Crashes\":\n\n``` cr\n# ls -l /tmp/Atom\\ Crashes/\ntotal 8\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 gad  wheel  68 Aug 14 21:42 completed/\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 gad  wheel  68 Aug 14 21:42 new/\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 gad  wheel  68 Aug 14 21:42 pending/\n-rw-r--r--  1 gad  wheel  40 Aug 14 21:46 settings.dat\n```\n\nThe problem is that this is created with a generic name, but it is owned by the active user and no other users can modify it (which **is** how it should be -- in fact, it could be argued that no other users should be allowed to read it).\n\nThe problem comes when I try to switch users in MacOS 10, using fast-user switching.  If I try to start up Atom on a second userid, and if I have the console.app running, I'll see an endless stream of error messages:\n\n``` cr\n<timestamp> PM crashpad_handler[<pid>]: [0814/212739:ERROR:file_io_posix.cc(153)] open /tmp/Atom Crashes/settings.dat: Permission denied\n```\n\nI have to switch back to the first userid, bring up Terminal, and `rm -rf /tmp/Atom*`.  And of course this means that Atom.app cannot be left running on two different sessions at the same time, which is disappointing.\n\nIf Atom is going to create a directory in /tmp, then it should include the userid (or the user's UID) in the name of the directory.  I think the directory should also be created with permissions 700, not 755.\n\nI notice that in MacOS 10, the directory has the attribute:\n\n``` cr\n# ls -ld@ /tmp/Atom\\ Crashes\ndrwxr-xr-x@ 6 gad  wheel  204 Aug 14 21:42 /tmp/Atom Crashes/\n    org.chromium.crashpad.database.initialized    1 \n```\n\nif that helps to track this down.\n\nFWIW:\n\n``` cr\n# atom --version\nAtom    : 1.9.8\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\n\n# apm --version\napm  1.10.0\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.10\ngit 2.9.1\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4118","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507404130","x-github-request-id":"DA01:429B:912D57:132955C:59D928C3","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=114>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=112>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"0f1e2b3de875fb60b5e381bcf612be19\"","status":"200 OK"}}
