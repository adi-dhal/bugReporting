I would like it to place the single cursor at the original selection.\n\nExplanation:\nI got used to Sublime positioning the single cursor at the original cursor location.  At first, I thought it was an arbitrary decision and that I would adjust to atom's way of doing it.  Now I've decided that it's not entirely subjective.  In many cases, my original cursor was intentionally placed at the original position, and that's where I would like it to return to.  For example, maybe I was editing something in-line and thought that this particular word (variable name) I was editing should be edited in a few places at the same time.  After doing this, I would like to return to my original train of thought - editing that line that I was on before creating multiple selections.  I would also think that in any cases where I didn't intentionally place my cursor on a particular instance, the decision is arbitrary whether it takes me to the original or final cursor upon pressing `esc`, so this might be a safe change to make for all use cases.  At least an option for altering this behavior would be much-appreciated.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7738/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7737","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7737/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7737/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7737/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7737","id":93361519,"number":7737,"title":"Sometimes
