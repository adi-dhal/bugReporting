It would be useful to have another command to \"Stage Updates\" similar to `git add --update` which will only stage files which are already under version control and have been modified.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open a project with a git repository\r\n2. Modify some version controlled files and create some new files\r\n3. Open the git user interface\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** A \"Stage Update\" command allows staging the modified files only, while \"Stage All\" does what it does currently.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Only a \"Stage All\" command exists\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.19.2\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\nDebian Sid\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nNone","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15773","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15773/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15773/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15773/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15773","id":261572272,"number":15773,"title":"Configure Atom to always open files in new windows","user":{"login":"Feuermurmel","id":50332,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/50332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Feuermurmel","html_url":"https://github.com/Feuermurmel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Feuermurmel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Feuermurmel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Feuermurmel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Feuermurmel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Feuermurmel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Feuermurmel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Feuermurmel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Feuermurmel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Feuermurmel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-09-29T08:46:55Z","updated_at":"2017-09-29T18:19:43Z","closed_at":"2017-09-29T18:19:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

It seems that there is currently no way to configure Atom to open files in a separate windows instead of an already existing one. \r\n\r\nThis even happens when there's no Atom window in the current Space but there's one on another Space. Then I'm inadvertently switched to that other Space (which breaks my workflow) and the file is opened in a window there.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open one file from Finder\r\n2. Open a second file from Finder\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\n\r\nI now have two windows, each having one of the files opened.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\n\r\nBoth files are opened in a single window instead.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nI'm running OS X 10.11.6.\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.20.1\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15773/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15772","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15772/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15772/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15772/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15772","id":261557259,"number":15772,"title":"Installation failed Windows10","user":{"login":"killerdevildog11","id":16379786,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/16379786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/killerdevildog11","html_url":"https://github.com/killerdevildog11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/killerdevildog11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/killerdevildog11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/killerdevildog11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/killerdevildog11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/killerdevildog11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/killerdevildog11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/killerdevildog11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/killerdevildog11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/killerdevildog11/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-09-29T07:43:01Z","updated_at":"2017-09-29T08:24:29Z","closed_at":"2017-09-29T08:24:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Tried to install Atom using the executable from atom.io , ran for about 20 mins. closed then tried running it again\r\n\r\n[SquirrelSetup.log](https://github.com/atom/atom/files/1343465/SquirrelSetup.log)\r\n![screenshot 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16379786/31005785-0ab8b270-a4af-11e7-9386-be0cf8aa492c.png)\r\n\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15772/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15771","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15771/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15771/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15771/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15771","id":261506374,"number":15771,"title":"How can I use stdin in java?","user":{"login":"goojungpotato","id":28240079,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/28240079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/goojungpotato","html_url":"https://github.com/goojungpotato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goojungpotato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goojungpotato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goojungpotato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goojungpotato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goojungpotato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goojungpotato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goojungpotato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goojungpotato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goojungpotato/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":175213356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/question","name":"question","color":"ededed","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-09-29T01:24:59Z","updated_at":"2017-09-29T04:59:17Z","closed_at":"2017-09-29T04:59:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

(If I watch the cursor, it will blink 5 times, then pause 2, then start again.) Obviously see this when coding -- lag then type appears. If I leave the editor open, in the background while I'm working in other apps, it will eventually crash, after ~20mins.\r\n\r\nWorth noting:\r\n- I have latest stable release installed (1.20.1), with only the core packages installed and enabled.\r\n- I've wiped my machine of Atom and all hidden files and reinstalled. Same result.\r\n- I've tried safe mode. Same result.\r\n- I've tried clearing saved state. Same result.\r\n- I've reset to factory settings. Same result.\r\n- Following a crash, I've looked in Console for a crash report. There is never one.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open Atom\r\n2. Start working in any file, or even just working in the app at all\r\n3. Notice the lagging\r\n4. Leave app open, wait for the crash after ~20 mins\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** I would expect to work in the editor with no lag and no intermittent crashes.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** It lags every 5 secs, for 2 secs; crashes after being open for ~20 mins.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Every time I have it open.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.20.1\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  :

Simply regenerating the `.icns` files based on the PNG master files using `iconutil` fixes the issue. I am however not able to verify if they still look as intended on macOS 10.12 (and older).\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\nWill have to ship separate icon set for macOS 10.13 if this does not work as intended on older releases of macOS.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\nIcon resources reside in this repo.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\nApplication icons look like they should â€” not washed out.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\nMight break icons on macOS versions older than 10.13.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\nFixes

Both show up in the 'Applications' folder but I find Launchpad is an easier way to open programs that are not in my dock.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Install Atom\r\n2. Install Atom beta\r\n3. Open Launchpad\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** \r\n\r\nTo see a green Atom icon and a gold Atom Beta icon\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\nThe last version you install is the only icon that displays. So if I installed Atom and then Atom Beta all I see is the gold Atom Beta icon in Launchpad.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:**\r\n\r\nSeems to be all the time.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom:

It is not possible for the `shift-alt-b` key combination to resolve properly in my editor anywhere. This started occurring in the past week. It is only occurring in Atom as I have this globally setup as a keybinding on my Mac to be `select-backwards-by-word` via the KeyBindingsEditor app, and that is continuing to work globally (I have tried turned this off to confirm that it's no conflict). \r\n\r\nI've used the Keybinding Resolver to find out that `shift-alt-b` => `shift-i`, but now I'm stuck. Due to running in safe mode, I've confirmed this isn't a 3rd party package causing a problem. I'd like to debug this further, but I am not sure of what next steps to take. If someone can give me that next thing to try then I'd be happy to give it a go as this is an important keybinding in my workflow and it's driving me nuts. \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nI believe this to be a local issue with my machine, but in case it's not: \r\n1. Add the following to your keymap.cson: \r\n```coffeescript\r\n'atom-workspace':\r\n  'alt-shift-B': 'editor:select-to-beginning-of-word'\r\n```\r\n2. Try typing `shift-alt-b` in editor.\r\n3. View in resolver that this resolves to `shift-I`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** I except my keybinding to work and have the correct keys resolved. \r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Resolving to incorrect keys. \r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Consistently on my machine.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\n ~  Â» atom --version   \r\nAtom    : 1.20.1\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\n\r\n ~  Â» apm --version\r\napm  1.18.4\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.13\r\ngit 2.11.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI believe I've covered it all.
