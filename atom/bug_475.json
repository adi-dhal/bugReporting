Not sure how to be more detailed here without spending a ton of time on it.\n\nI suspect this has to do with the number of files in the project since I see it happen a lot more with github/github.\n\nProject find is still trolling me hard, frequently showing old content and deleted/moved files. It's also still a pain to bounce back and forth without tabs turned on. If there's already a \"Project Find Results\" \"tab\" open, why do I have to hit <enter> in the panel as if I'm searching again?\n\nAtom Version: 0.48.0\nUser Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac
