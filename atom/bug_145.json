Build atom:\n   \n   ```\n   $ git fetch -p --all\n   $ git checkout $(git tag --sort=\"version:refname\" | grep -v -E \"alpha|beta\" | tail -n 1)\n   $ script/build\n   $ script/grunt install --install-dir /…/atom-install\n   $ /…/atom-install/bin/apm update\n   ```\n   \n   (/…/atom-install/ is empty before starting grunt)\n2. Remove atom config from home:\n   \n   ```\n   mv ~/.atom ~/.atom-backup\n   ```\n3. Start atom:\n   \n   ```\n   atom --safe\n   ```\n4. Clean \n   \n   ```\n   rm -rf /…/atom-install/*\n   ```\n5. Repeat steps 1. to 3., but now checkout version 1.6.2 in step 1. → Atom starts as expected.\n\n**Expected behavior:** Atom starts like in versions <= 1.6.x\n\n**Actual behavior:** See Description (fails since 1.7.0)\n### Versions\n\nI'm running on Debian Stretch aka testing.

I've recently came back to atom, I updated it to 1.7.0 (now to 1.7.1) and opened atom in the current directory by `atom .`. This works correctly. But when I want to open another window in different directory `atom .` doesn't work anymore. I also tried the new `atom -a .` command and it doesn't work either.\n\nI realised that `atom .` command works only when the editor is completely closed. Only when there is no instance running, I'm able to open it from CLI. But when it's already running, I'm unable to open a new window, or add it as a project to existing one.\n\nTo be precise, it looks like something happens there, atom starts opening, but then it quits. Atom just blinks in menu bar for a few ms and then disappears.\n\nI also tried this with the recent beta. I found an error that happens there. When I open beta in CLI like this `$ /Applications/Atom\\ Beta.app/Contents/MacOS/Atom`, the atom opens:\n\n```\n$ /Applications/Atom\\ Beta.app/Contents/MacOS/Atom\n2016-04-15 11:36:48.812 Atom[92173:6330910] App load time: 289ms\n```\n\nThen when I try to open a new window with `atom-beta .`, I see this error in beta log:\n\n```\n2016-04-15 11:38:38.176 Atom[92173:6330910] Unexpected end of input\n2016-04-15 11:38:38.183 Atom[92173:6330910] SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input\n    at Object.parse (native)\n    at Socket.<anonymous> (/Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/src/browser/atom-application.js:244:28)\n    at emitOne (events.js:77:13)\n    at Socket.emit (events.js:169:7)\n    at readableAddChunk (_stream_readable.js:146:16)\n    at Socket.Readable.push (_stream_readable.js:110:10)\n    at Pipe.onread (net.js:523:20)\n2016-04-15 11:38:38.184 Atom[92173:6330910] Unexpected token .\n2016-04-15 11:38:38.185 Atom[92173:6330910] SyntaxError: Unexpected token .\n    at Object.parse (native)\n    at Socket.<anonymous> (/Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/src/browser/atom-application.js:244:28)\n    at emitOne (events.js:77:13)\n    at Socket.emit (events.js:169:7)\n    at readableAddChunk (_stream_readable.js:146:16)\n    at Socket.Readable.push (_stream_readable.js:110:10)\n    at Pipe.onread (net.js:523:20)\n```\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.

If you have Node installed on the machine and replace `process.execPath` with the path to Node everything works as expected (tested with Node v5.9.0).\n\nThis has been reported as an issue by users updating to v1.7.0 on the following linter plugins:\n- `linter-jshint`\n- `linter-htmlhint`\n- `linter-csslint`\n- Possibly `linter-bootlint` as well (Looks like this might just be user error)\n\nNote that none of those linters have AppVeyor (Windows) CI testing configured.\n\nThe following Node based linters _are_ being tested on AppVeyor, but it turns out all of these are directly being `require`'d, and as such aren't being ran as an \"external\" Node process:\n- linter-stylelint\n- linter-js-yaml\n\n`linter-eslint` is interesting in that it _is_ working, but it utilizes a worker process that is being created with [`child_process.fork()`](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-eslint/blob/v7.2.0/src/helpers.js#L15).\n\nThis _might_ be a duplicate of https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2887, is probably caused by https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9627, and might be related to https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11162.\n\nIf there is any further information or debugging information that would help please let me know. I'm almost always available as @arcanemagus on Atom's Slack instance if anything is needed.\n\n@50Wliu, @joshaber, @joefitzgerald I'm tagging you three as it seems you have all worked on parts of the Electron update and might know more about how to further test this.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.

Then it couldn't be started and returned an error during the start. Running of the installer on top that installation didn't help.\n\nI managed to get rid of this error by starting the second instance of atom with `atom --safe`\nwhile the one problematic was opened, then closed the problematic one first. Now Atom could be restarted without this crash, but I've lost all unsaved changes in files and project structure, so I think that the problem might be somewhere in user-session parameters\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Run search in the directory\n2. Search hangs\n3. Atom stop responding and show crash error after restart\n### Versions\n\n```\n$ atom --version\nAtom    : 1.7.0\nElectron: 0.36.8\nChrome  : 47.0.2526.110\nNode    : 5.1.1\n\n$ apm --version\napm  1.9.2\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython\ngit 2.7.4.windows.1\nvisual studio\n```\n\nwindows 10 home\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11469/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11468","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11468/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11468/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11468/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11468","id":148420198,"number":11468,"title":"Metrics disabled default update","user":{"login":"beautispy","id":18467775,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/18467775?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beautispy","html_url":"https://github.com/beautispy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beautispy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beautispy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beautispy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beautispy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beautispy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beautispy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beautispy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beautispy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beautispy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-04-14T16:44:50Z","updated_at":"2016-04-17T23:01:45Z","closed_at":"2016-04-17T23:01:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Please see https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4966\n\nIt appears the community's issue has been closed for near half a year and this issue isn't fixed yet.

Enable \"Soft Wrap at Prefereed Line Length\"\n2. Write some text that covers about 1/3 of the preferred line length\n3.

I tracked down the issue to `ELECTRON_ENABLE_LOGGING`, which was preventing deprecations from being logged out. This is how this PR changes the `run-specs` task to handle this scenario correctly:\n1. :bug: Use `ELECTRON_ENABLE_LOGGING=true`. This allows us to capture the output of calls to `console.warn` and `console.log`, which are useful to log out Grim deprecations.\n2. :fire: Remove calls to `logDeprecations`. This method used to format the output captured in `stderr` to strip out \"[Console]\" noise from deprecations. This code path was not running anymore because we started using `stdio: 'inherit'` in #10838 for core specs, which prevents stderr output to be captured. I feel like it's okay to remove it, as the output is already readable as it is.\n\nYou can see a sample of a new build here: https://travis-ci.org/atom/atom/jobs/123049543#L254-L257.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11458","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11458/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11458/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11458/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11458","id":148258589,"number":11458,"title":"Strange Problem","user":{"login":"Akshar-Patel","id":18311126,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/18311126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akshar-Patel","html_url":"https://github.com/Akshar-Patel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akshar-Patel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akshar-Patel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akshar-Patel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akshar-Patel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akshar-Patel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akshar-Patel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akshar-Patel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akshar-Patel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Akshar-Patel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-04-14T05:46:07Z","updated_at":"2016-04-14T13:33:16Z","closed_at":"2016-04-14T13:33:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\n\nAdding just one line in file modifies other lines even when we don't touch other lines.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.
