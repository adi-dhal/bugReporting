It locked up the UI thread for like 5-6 seconds loading jQuery. This PR makes that process asynchronous. We render lines in an untokenized form initially, then tokenize them one chunk at a time in the background while yielding back to the UI thread between chunks.\n\n**This still isn't good enough, but it's a start.** This approach still consumes a lot of time on the UI thread, so even though we haven't locked it completely, performance is still pretty crappy during tokenization. To _truly_ tokenize in the background, we need to use a worker thread or another process. That will allow the UI to be super responsive even while we are tokenizing.

This means that when an event triggers multiple changes, (like a change in the selection, the cursor position, and the lines in the editor, for example) we don't touch the DOM at all until the end of the event cycle. To do these, we needed to batch up update events on the editor and then have a way of rendering them all at once. Now typing a character updates the screen without any extraneous reflows.\n\nAlso, it turns out that blinking the cursor with a CSS animation causes Atom to be less responsive because WebKit is busy sampling the editor's display 60 times a second and sometimes our keystrokes miss a frame. Blinking with a timer is better, so that's what we do now.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/97/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/96","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/96/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/96/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/96/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/96","id":8342158,"number":96,"title":"cmd-shift-[
