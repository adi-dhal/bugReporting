And on network filesystems, that IO was really expensive, which meant the lock would be held for a looooooong time. See also https://github.com/nodegit/nodegit/pull/968 which removes the need for `repo.workdir()` and friends to acquire the lock.\n\nThere are a couple other cases that we found where a lock could be acquired on the main thread:\n- [x] `repo.path()`\n- [x] `Git.Ignore.pathIsIgnored` (https://github.com/nodegit/nodegit/pull/970)\n\nEven with these changes, performance will still be worse than 1.5.4 because both `GitRepository` and `GitRepositoryAsync` are refreshing their status from git which requires a lot of IO—where in 1.5.4 we only had `GitRepository`.\n\nIdeally `GitRepository` would only do work if some package is using it. Currently that’ll always be the case as `tree-view` hasn’t been updated to use `GitRepositoryAsync` yet (see https://github.com/atom/tree-view/pull/624). But once `tree-view` is updated, that would be a good optimization to do as well.\n\n/cc @nathansobo \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11277/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11276","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11276/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11276/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11276/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11276","id":143512234,"number":11276,"title":"Autocomplete+ does not make it easy to select what you typed as correct","user":{"login":"fields","id":52378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/52378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fields","html_url":"https://github.com/fields","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fields/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fields/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fields/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fields/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fields/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fields/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fields/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fields/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fields/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-03-25T14:29:57Z","updated_at":"2016-04-04T21:43:04Z","closed_at":"2016-03-28T16:53:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I am frequently frustrated by the corrections that autocomplete+ makes as I type, but it is very useful to have _suggestions_.

These include long URLs, so I have Soft Wrap turned on.\n\n![soft-wrap](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5524469/14026882/f29a84a2-f1c2-11e5-9d48-b918985b3407.png)\n\nNote how the line gets broken in the middle of the word \"Final\". There are lots of better places for a line break.\n\nWhen I go into my Settings, there's an input box for \"Non Word Characters\"; these characters define word boundaries. It seems to me that it would make sense for Soft Wrap to break lines at word boundaries instead of only at spaces.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Enable Soft Wrap (in the View menu)\n2. Write a line of text that exceeds the width of the buffer, thus triggering soft wrap. The line should include some of the Non Word Characters: `/\\()\"':,.;<>~!@#$%^&*|+=[]{}?-`\n\n**Expected behavior:** Line wraps at a word boundary.\n\n**Actual behavior:** Lines wrap only at spaces.\n### Versions\n\n1.6.0\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11268/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11267","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11267/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11267/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11267/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11267","id":143311440,"number":11267,"title":"Fixed selection.copy, which caused bugs in selection.insertText when pasting","user":{"login":"brentshermana","id":8827592,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8827592?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentshermana","html_url":"https://github.com/brentshermana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentshermana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentshermana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentshermana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentshermana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentshermana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentshermana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentshermana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentshermana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brentshermana/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722948,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-review","name":"needs-review","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-03-24T17:33:44Z","updated_at":"2017-03-04T17:19:10Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/11267","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11267","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11267.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11267.patch"},"body":"Referenced Issues: [1](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9045) [2](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5473) [3](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4461) \n\nIn the specific case where you copy text beginning with a newline, the metadata field 'indentBasis' can be improperly stored, which doesn't create any issues until you try to paste somewhere else and the 'autoIndentOnPaste'  setting is on. It uses that incorrect indentBasis which results in incorrect indentation.\n### evidence for the bug\n\n1) Take a build of atom besides this one, and make a new file. add the following text:\n\n```\none\n  two\n```\n\n2) Add `\\n\\ttwo` to your clipboard by clicking and dragging from the right of 'two' until the right on 'one'. It's important that you capture that newline character.\n\n3) With your cursor to the right of 'two', press cmd+v or ctrl+v depending on your OS. You should have had  the twos at the same indentation level, but instead the second two will be indented twice.\n\n4) If you're not convinced yet, you can try this again with the first 'two' indented twice, and you'll see the second one indented four times.\n### What Happens\n\ncopy() takes the indent level of the first selected line and stores that as the indentBasis. The user will want an indentBasis of 1, but get an indentBasis of 0 because \\n is technically on the previous line.\n### Why this matters\n\nWhen people copy/paste large bodies of text, they will often drag their cursor up and to the right of whatever they're copying, which will give them that initial newline character. Knowing to avoid this is a workaround people shouldn't have to consider when they're focused on writing whatever they're writing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11267/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11266","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11266/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11266/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11266/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11266","id":143303675,"number":11266,"title":"Haskell-ghc-mod: ghc-mod command browse failed with error Error","user":{"login":"sgraf812","id":1151264,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1151264?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgraf812","html_url":"https://github.com/sgraf812","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgraf812/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgraf812/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgraf812/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgraf812/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgraf812/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgraf812/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgraf812/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgraf812/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgraf812/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-03-24T17:05:23Z","updated_at":"2016-03-24T17:06:46Z","closed_at":"2016-03-24T17:06:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"1.

It seems the folding brackets in atom still not perfect yet. I have .cpp code : \n\n``` c++\nvoid send_request(int seq, char* a, int i)\n{\n    if (seq >= 0) a[\"seq\"] = seq;\n    int size = bencode(msg_buf, e);\n#if defined DEBUG && IOSTREAM\n    std::cerr << \"sending: \" <<  e << \"\\n\";\n#endif\n\n    if (i == g_sent_packets.end())\n    {\n        TEST_ERROR(\"not responding\");\n        return;\n    }\n\n    g_sent_packets.erase(i);\n}\n```\n\nFolding the if statement and #if directive is correct (or at least what I really expected). But folding the class is wrong.\n\nBelow is the screenshot of after-folding code\n![screenshot from 2016-03-24 17 51 25](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2739025/14024369/09e070a6-f1e9-11e5-96bb-02754032ebb7.png)\n\nI'm not sure if this happened because I put the directive inside the function. Some other function without directives just fold fine.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open Atom (both in safe mode or not still produces same bug)\n2. Open the file\n3. Fold line 2\n4.

When the user opens a file, it is opened with the correct encoding.\n2. When the user creates a new file and saves it, it is saved with the correct encoding.\n\nThese are two separate use cases. \"auto-detect\" encoding is not applicable to creating new files. I am not familiar with the dependencies and relation between core and encoding-selector (I don't know if encoding-selector can intercept an \"open file\"?), but here is a possible solution from a use case perspective:\n- For opening files, **always** try to auto-detect encoding.\n- The user sets his or her **preferred encoding**. The preferred encoding is used when creating **new files**.\n- The user sets a **fallback encoding**. Fallback encoding is used when **Opening a file** and **auto-detect fails**.\n\nUsing the term _\"default encoding\"_ is bad in this case since it is ambiguous.\n\n_Edit 2016-05-10_: Suggestions for

[here](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-ui/pull/127).\n\nCurrently `atom-overlay`s overlap the rest of the UI. I think it's ok, but only as long as the current line is visible. If you scroll it \"out of sight\", it looks odd having the overlay still be shown.\n\nA possible solution might be to try to detect when the current line is not visible and then hide the `atom-overlay`. I think autocomplete kinda already tries to do that by jumping to the top when scrolling down, but doesn't hide completely. And would be nice if it's part of the core behavior, so all packages would get it. Maybe with an option to opt-out if a package wants stay visible all the time.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open find + replace `cmd-f`\n2. Have autocomplete enabled and type something to open the autocomplete overlay.\n3.
