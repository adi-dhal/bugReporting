And of course it's also true that if the empty line does _not_ match the `increaseIndentPattern` or `decreaseNextIndentPattern` (which will be the case in most cases) this change will have no effect except for the fact that the also the empty line is now also matched against the regexp's.\n\nAs for the tests... I didn't add any new ones for this use case because currently no language package is using this. The issue https://github.com/atom-haskell/language-haskell/issues/40 and some discussion on Gitter lead me to this change/fix as it seems at least the `langange-haskell` package would like to use it. But until (if) they actually do, I cannot write a test for this I think... All existing tests do still pass and I worked with it for a day now and didn't notice any side effects...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8002/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8001","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8001/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8001/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8001/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8001","id":96280442,"number":8001,"title":"Please give us discrete options how to deal with indentation","user":{"login":"weichert","id":378082,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/378082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weichert","html_url":"https://github.com/weichert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weichert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weichert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weichert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weichert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weichert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weichert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weichert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weichert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weichert/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-07-21T10:17:22Z","updated_at":"2015-07-21T12:04:55Z","closed_at":"2015-07-21T12:04:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"As it stands Atom is using \"auto-detection\" to decide if it should use tabs or spaces to indent and then how many.\nThat can break in edge cases and if it does it's usually polluting code in unexpected ways.\n\nPlease give us an option like you did with character encoding, integrated into the status bar like so many other professional editors do.\n\nThat way we can say: This file is using 4 spaces to indent exclusively, period.

initially enabling this option, the menu bar does indeed hide, and hitting the **ALT** key does toggle it showing/hiding.\n\nThe problem occurs when you have files open and you want to show the menu

But then clicking on any other open tab pressing the **ALT** key doesn't make the menu appear.\n\nThe attached GIF shows it in action.

This effort is timeboxed: the plan is to finish around the **beginning of Sept**. This means **we probably won't get everything done on this list** during the allotted time window. After this time window, unfinished things will work into our normal issue handling routine.\n### What does this mean?\n\nThe goal of the quality initiative is to focus on fixing bugs and adding features that impact a lot of people, but are reasonably low effort. Why? There are a lot of low effort things affecting many people, and a lot of issues that slipped through the cracks while we were focused on the API and 1.0. We're just giving our selves some time to focus on them.\n\nThese will be small projects, ideally 1-2 days max. We will avoid rewrites or major refactoring.\n\nThe quality initiative will be our main focus, but we will still handle issues and review PRs&mdash;think of this effort as our 80% time.\n### What about X bug/feature?\n\nAfter this quality initiative, we plan on shifting our 80% time to focus on things like [performance](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/307), better support for [international users](https://github.com/atom/atom-keymap/issues/37), and some features we have in mind.\n\nIf you know of a bug or feature that is high-impact / low-effort, not in the list below, and does not fall under performance or internationalization, comment on this issue and we'll figure out if it fits in.\n### Core\n#### Bug\n- [ ] Fix largest uncaught errors in bugsnag\n- [ ] Continue fixing uncaught errors from https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7740\n  - [x] Cannot read property 'dispose' of undefined https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/183\n  - [x] Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'isEmpty' of undefined https://github.com/atom/bracket-matcher/issues/102\n- [x] Fix erasing files when no disk space \n  - [x] https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3158 @nathansobo\n- [ ] Fix app auto-update issues\n  - [x] https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7833\n  - [x] https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6612\n  - [ ] https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7854\n  - [ ] better feedback https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8038\n- [ ] Fix app update and release notes issues\n  - [ ] https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5692\n  - [ ] https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6922\n  - [ ] https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3757\n  - [ ] https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6482\n- [ ] Investigate issues when changing branches\n  - [ ] https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4982\n  - [ ] https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6210\n- [x] Cannot open files or folders on Mac OS X El Capitan beta https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7811 (:heart: :apple:)\n  - Likely fixed with upgrade to latest atom shell\n- [ ] Text editor interaction problems\n  - [ ] Line up/down with multiple selections is broken https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2470\n  - [ ] Beeping when using ctrl-cmd-down\n    - @zcbenz?
