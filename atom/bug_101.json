Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nEven though npm3 has been enforced on external apps, Atom built-in apps are not using this structure yet!  \nI downloaded atom-windows.zip (Tried with both [Beta](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/download/v1.11.0-beta5/atom-windows.zip)  and [stable](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/download/v1.10.2/atom-windows.zip)), when I extracted this zip file, the packages inside “resources” folder had long chain of sub-directories, the path-size of these sub-directories range upto 206 characters, one example of such path is as follows\n\n```\nAtom\\app-1.10.2\\resources\\app\\apm\\node_modules\\npm\\node_modules\\request\\node_modules\\har-validator\\node_modules\\is-my-json-valid\\node_modules\\generate-object-property\\node_modules\\is-property\\is-property.js\n```\n\nSince Windows MAX_PATH is restricted to 260 characters, we cannot extract Atom or relocate existing installation of Atom onto a location where the path size is more than 54 characters (260-206=54) \n### Versions\n\nAforementioned issue exists on both 1.10.2 (Current stable release) and 1.11.0-beta5 (Latest beta version)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12805/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12804","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12804/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12804/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12804/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12804","id":179726007,"number":12804,"title":"Add

Prerequisites\n- [ ] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n\ncannot use safe mode with this use case\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [ ] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n\ncannot use these tips with this use case.\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n\nnothing applicable to be find here.\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nI have Atom set as the default program for files with extension \".sql\". If I double-click a .sql file in Windows Explorer _while Atom is not yet running_, Atom opens correctly with the file. If I click another \".sql\" file, that file is correctly opened in the same Atom window in a new tab. This works the same if I right-click and select \"Open with Atom\".\n\nNow I shut down Atom, and manually open Atom (Windows key -> Atom). Atom opens with the last session state. If I now double-click an SQL file in Windows Explorer, _a second Atom instance_ opens with the file. If on the other hand I right-click->Open with Atom, the file opens in the existing Atom window in a new tab.\n\nWhen double-clicking a file while an Atom instance was previously started manually (Windows key -> Atom), that file should open in the existing window, not open a new Atom instance.\n\nBtw. the same issue happens when trying to open an SQL email attachment from Outlook. If Atom was previously started manually, this will open a new Atom instance with the file. It does not re-use the existing instance.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open Atom manually, eg Start menu->GitHub, Inc -> Atom\n2. Open Windows Explorer\n3. Locate a file who's extension has been associated with Atom\n4. Double-click that file\n\n**Expected behavior:** The file from (4) opens in the existing Atom window\n\n**Actual behavior:** A new Atom instance opens with the file. Now there are 2 Atom windows/instances\n### Versions\n- Atom 1.10.2\n- Electron 0.37.8\n- Chrome 49.0.2623.75\n- Node 5.10.0\n- Windows 7 Professional SP1\n\nYou can get this information from executing `atom --version` and `apm --version` at the command line. Also, please include the OS and what version of the OS you're running.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12800/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12799","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12799/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12799/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12799/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12799","id":179670395,"number":12799,"title":"1.11

Being a text editor, not being able to type a character in the normal way is a pretty big limitation.\n\nEven worse, if you unbind the mentioned keys, nothing happens at all when they are typed.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open a new or existing text file.\n2. Try to type an opening single or double curly quote (option-] or option-[).\n\n**Expected behavior:**\nThe expected character should be typed.\n\n**Actual behavior:**\nA list of open tabs appears, or if the keys are unmapped, nothing at all happens.\n### Versions\n\nAtom    : 1.10.2\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\n\napm  1.12.5\nnpm  3.10.5\nnode 4.4.5\npython
