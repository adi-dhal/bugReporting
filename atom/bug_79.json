It works fine if I just stay in Atom, but if I switch to another program, then back to Atom, the tablet stops functioning normally. \r\n\r\nThis only happens when I have Atom open, but it effects all applications. For example, if I start Atom, switch to Chrome, then back to Atom, then back to Chrome, I now can't click/select anything with the tablet in any app (not just Atom).\r\n\r\nWhen I don't have Atom open, the issue does not occur.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open Atom\r\n2. Switch to another application\r\n3. Switch back to Atom (Wacom tablet will now not click or select anything)\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom: 1.12.7\r\nMac: Sierra, 10.12\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13485/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13484","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13484/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13484/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13484/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13484","id":197007721,"number":13484,"title":"Atom.io spaces are too wide","user":{"login":"somethingedgar","id":20056979,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/20056979?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/somethingedgar","html_url":"https://github.com/somethingedgar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somethingedgar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somethingedgar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somethingedgar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somethingedgar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somethingedgar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somethingedgar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somethingedgar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somethingedgar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somethingedgar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":175213356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/question","name":"question","color":"ededed","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-12-21T18:58:43Z","updated_at":"2016-12-21T19:04:02Z","closed_at":"2016-12-21T19:03:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ever since I downloaded Atom I noticed the spaces being wider than usual and I've tried googling the problem but nothing works.

This can be misleading. For instance, with a project setup like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nproject\r\n└ folder1\r\n  └ package.json\r\n└ folder2\r\n  └ package.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we open `~/random/path/package.json`, the title bar will show `package.json — folder1`, which is incorrect. This made more sense previously, when the project only contained a single folder, but now the behavior seems misleading.\r\n\r\nIn order to provide the most pertinent information, this PR changes the behavior to the following:\r\n\r\n* If the active pane item has a path that is included in a project folder, we show `item title — project folder` (as is the current behavior)\r\n* If the active pane item has a path that is NOT included in a project folder, we show `item title — path to file` (where the path does not include the filename — in the example above, it'd be `~/random/path`)\r\n* If there is no active pane item (i.e., the pane is empty), we simply show `untitled`\r\n\r\nFixes #5058\r\nFixes #5585\r\nFixes #10710\r\n\r\n/cc @atom/feedback ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13475/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13474","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13474/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13474/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13474/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13474","id":196576432,"number":13474,"title":"[OF-TOPIC] Atom like windows installer.","user":{"login":"abuhenasobuj","id":16954436,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/16954436?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abuhenasobuj","html_url":"https://github.com/abuhenasobuj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abuhenasobuj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abuhenasobuj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abuhenasobuj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abuhenasobuj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abuhenasobuj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abuhenasobuj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abuhenasobuj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abuhenasobuj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abuhenasobuj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722939,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"e6e6e6","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-12-20T03:14:38Z","updated_at":"2016-12-21T12:16:04Z","closed_at":"2016-12-20T04:59:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13473","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13473/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13473/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13473/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13473","id":196575859,"number":13473,"title":"Prevent builds on Node 7+ until they're fixed","user":{"login":"lee-dohm","id":1038121,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1038121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm","html_url":"https://github.com/lee-dohm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-12-20T03:08:31Z","updated_at":"2016-12-20T04:08:21Z","closed_at":"2016-12-20T04:08:21Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/13473","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13473","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13473.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13473.patch"},"body":"I ran into strange problems with builds not working when I accidentally upgraded my environment to Node v7.

This is not only annoying to have to wait nearly a second to even use Atom but its gotten to the point where myself and a few other community members have switched to alternative editors whilst this is being fixed.\r\n\r\nI have cleared out everything imaginable on my system to \"Fresh Install\" atom.\r\n\r\n- Standard Uninstalled\r\n- Removed all Atom packages\r\n- Deleted `~/.atom/`\r\n- Deleted `~/AppData/Local/Atom/`\r\n- Deleted `~/AppData/Roaming/Atom/`\r\n\r\nOnce I fresh installed Atom I even tried disabling certain Atom functions know to cause some delay from the other issues on GitHub Atom/Atom.\r\n\r\n- Anything git related\r\n- The filetree/sidebar\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open Atom\r\n2. Have a project folder open\r\n2. Experience input delay\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n1. Have a project folder open\r\n2. Refocus Atom\r\n3. Experience input delay\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** \r\nAtom should (and used to) focus the window immediately and text could be pasted or typed without delay (sub 100ms). \r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** \r\nAtom hangs, with something in the background being ran/processed for 800ms or so, and the user is left to wait it out, and then can use the program as needed after the second or so delay.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots and GIF video\r\n\r\n![1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2348814/21235771/d863d472-c2bd-11e6-8f5a-1f0a5f8f3615.png)\r\n\r\n![2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2348814/21235774/d9e301a6-c2bd-11e6-9a91-e16c7a883080.png)\r\n\r\n![atom_issue](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2348814/21235760/cb2c4bae-c2bd-11e6-9033-29ccae85bad7.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Suggestions / thoughts\r\n\r\nI think the issue is related to something that is checked with files. When git packages are disabled the issue still exists. Hence this issue being different than the slow git refresh issue. \r\n\r\nTo fix this I would imagine digging to find the issue/cause and changing whatever task from being 1st priority enough to \"hang\" the app. To a much lower more back-grounded task, something that even if it must take 800ms, for it to not interfere with the user's experience, and input.\r\n\r\nI am able and willing to help out with this issue as needed.
