Run `atom -d -f .` or use the `Run package specs` command \n2. Notice how nothing appears\n\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]\n- With `atom -d` a new Atom window should open in dev mode.\n- With `Run package specs`, a new window with the test runner should appear.\n\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\n\nNothing happen at all. With `atom -d` the app starts (a new icon appears in the dock) but the window never appear. Only with the `-f` option the cause of the issue can be discovered.\n### Versions\n\n```\n> atom --version\nAtom    : 1.11.0-dev-6d25cc6\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    :

Description\n\n(Tested on Mac OS X 10.11.6)\n\nThere seems to be some odd behavior relating to how user interaction-based scrolling, and programatic scrolling, interact when occurring simultaneously. Specifically, if a user is scrolling in a text editor using the mouse wheel, programatic scroll commands (such as \"scroll to top\", \"scroll to bottom\", and so on) will move the cursor, but not change the scroll position of the editor.\n\nWhile this might sound like the proper behavior, it doesn't conform to standard scroll behavior of other Mac OS X apps (for example, Safari, or Text Editor). \n\nIt also leads to some odd edge cases: I use BetterTouchTool to map the \"three finger swipe up\" gesture on my trackpad to send a \"home\" key input. This allows me to swipe up with three fingers, and jump to the top of the document in most apps. However, this fails in Atom, because Atom starts to scroll as soon as I move my three fingers on the touchpad, it ignores the \"home\" key event subsequently sent by BTT when it registers the gesture.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Begin scrolling within a text editor using the touchpad\n2. While still scrolling, press \"cmd-down\" (mapped to \"scroll to bottom\" by default)\n\n**Expected behavior:** The editor (and cursor) jumps to the end of the document.\n\n**Actual behavior:** The cursor is moved to the end of the document, but the editor doesn't move.\n### Versions\n\n```\nMac OS X: 10.11.6\n\nAtom    : 1.11.0-beta5\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\n\napm  1.12.5\nnpm  3.10.5\nnode 4.4.5\npython 2.7.12\ngit 2.10.0\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12629/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12628","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12628/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12628/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12628/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12628","id":175683628,"number":12628,"title":"File associations not working on Windows 10 rev. 1607","user":{"login":"Marqin","id":959429,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/959429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marqin","html_url":"https://github.com/Marqin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marqin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marqin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marqin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marqin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marqin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marqin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marqin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marqin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marqin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-09-08T07:27:30Z","updated_at":"2017-09-15T18:06:52Z","closed_at":"2016-09-08T14:05:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"File associations from #10818 (fixing #4893) doesn't work on Windows 10 (rev. 1607).\n\nAtom version is 1.10.2\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.

Description\n\nOn Mac OS X, the context menu (i.e., the right click menu) in Atom opens directly under your cursor, rather than a few pixels to the right, as is standard in OS X. As a result, after you right-click, the first option in the menu is already selected, and left-clicking (without moving the mouse) will select this menu item, rather than dismissing the menu.\n\nApple's official [OS X Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/ContextualMenus.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000957-CH30-SW1) specifically state:\n\n> **Don’t set a default item in a contextual menu.** If the user opens the menu and closes it without selecting anything, no action should occur.\n\nWhile this doesn't directly mention menu location in relation to the cursor, it's implied by saying that the user should have to take action to select a menu item, and without that, no action should take place. \n\nYou can see the correct behavior in any number of other OS X apps. For example, in Safari, if you right-click on a page, the context menu appears a few pixels to the right of the cursor. This way, no menu item is selected until the user takes action and moves the cursor right. If you right-click, then click without moving the mouse, no action will be selected, and the menu will be dismissed. \n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. In Atom, open some file to edit.\n2. Right-click inside the editor _without moving the cursor_.\n3. Left-click, again without moving the cursor.\n\n**Expected behavior:** The context menu should be dismissed without any menu item being selected, or action being taken.\n\n**Actual behavior:** The \"Undo\" action is selected/acted on.\n### Versions\n\n```\nMac OS X: 10.11.6\n\nAtom    : 1.10.0\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\n\napm  1.12.5\nnpm  3.10.5\nnode 4.4.5\npython 2.7.12\ngit 2.10.0\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12624/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12623","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12623/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12623/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12623/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12623","id":175572729,"number":12623,"title":"Exclude VCS Files not working","user":{"login":"citylims","id":4462029,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4462029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/citylims","html_url":"https://github.com/citylims","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/citylims/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/citylims/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/citylims/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/citylims/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/citylims/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/citylims/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/citylims/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/citylims/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/citylims/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-09-07T18:23:32Z","updated_at":"2016-09-07T18:33:20Z","closed_at":"2016-09-07T18:33:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Been using Atom for a while now.

Doing almost any action while in this state causes them to reposition correctly. Actions that cause them to reposition are: resize the Atom window, click in the `TextEditor`, scroll the `TextEditor`, switch to another tab and back, use the arrow keys to move the cursor.\nI can reproduce this with all themes in safe mode on both Windows 10 and Windows 7.\n\nDiscovered and discussed over in https://github.com/atom/language-gfm/issues/167#issuecomment-244906162 where @nathansobo told me to open a new issue.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open Atom in safe mode.\n2. Ensure you have `Soft Wrap` enabled.\n3. Ensure you have `spell-check` enabled.\n4. Copy [this file](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Ben3eeE/6b9a8d5c3fbdd38bda3b70b63617b280/raw/77e0fc174f27160e82bd3c27f2d8182771770fb8/gistfile1.txt) into a new untitled `TextEditor` \n5.

This breaks git commands that modify the pack files, like `git gc`. When running `git gc`, I see errors like the following:\n\n```\nUnlink of file '.git/objects/pack/pack-0cca48411464b8ef80a288f080d3d8eef5321ae3.pack' failed. Should I try again? (y/n)\n```\n\nUsing [Process Explorer](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653), I was able to track down the file lock to the atom.exe process.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open project directory in Atom that is under git source control\n2. Perform enough commits to the git repo that a garbage collection will write new .pack and .idx files\n3. Try running `git gc` with Atom open\n\nOR\n1. Open project directory in Atom that is under git source control\n2. Observe atom.exe process holding open handles to .git files in Process Explorer\n\n**Expected behavior:** Atom does not hold open handles on .git files\n\n**Actual behavior:** Atom holds open handles on .git files\n### Versions\n\n```\nAtom    : 1.9.9\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\n```\n\nOS is Win 10.0.10240\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12620","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12620/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12620/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12620/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12620","id":175480735,"number":12620,"title":"\"Open with Atom\" no longer appears","user":{"login":"ErraticFox","id":6486865,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6486865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErraticFox","html_url":"https://github.com/ErraticFox","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErraticFox/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErraticFox/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErraticFox/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErraticFox/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErraticFox/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErraticFox/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErraticFox/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErraticFox/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErraticFox/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-09-07T11:38:59Z","updated_at":"2016-09-07T15:12:05Z","closed_at":"2016-09-07T15:12:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I manually uninstall Atom by accident (was trying to clear Atoms preferences).

(Ref.: https://mzl.la/2bXCXDn)\n\nWith this commit, we will intercept the `before-quit` events on `electron.app` and the `close` event on `BrowserWindow` (which will fire respectively before quitting the application and before closing a\nwindow), and prevent them from performing the default action. We will then ask each renderer process to save its state and, finally, close the window and/or the app when the IndexedDB transaction completes.\n\n/cc: @atom/core @thomasjo \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12619/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12618","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12618/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12618/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12618/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12618","id":175467179,"number":12618,"title":"Scrolling Problem in Windows","user":{"login":"hpt8592pro","id":20722291,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/20722291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpt8592pro","html_url":"https://github.com/hpt8592pro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpt8592pro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpt8592pro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpt8592pro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpt8592pro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpt8592pro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpt8592pro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpt8592pro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpt8592pro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpt8592pro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-09-07T10:25:18Z","updated_at":"2016-09-07T15:11:42Z","closed_at":"2016-09-07T15:11:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I love this editor.

Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct

search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nWhen at Atom update is available, I usually don't notice the blue squirrel button immediately. By the time I do click it, if I wait long enough (to let it download?), then Atom always shows me that the update is to the current version number that I'm already at.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Start up Atom when an update is available.\n2. Don't click the blue squirrel icon immediately. Leave Atom running for a while (to give it time to finish downloading the update first maybe? If that's the case, then I assume \"Automatically download updates\" must be on.)\n3. Click blue squirrel icon.\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n\nThe current version and a link to the current version's release notes should be shown at the top, and then the \"New update\" section should show the version number of the new update\n\n**Actual behavior:**\n\nThe current version and a link to the current version's release notes is shown at the top, and then the \"New update\" section shows my current version and a link to its release notes instead of the update's version.\n\nIf I restart Atom and then immediately click the blue squirrel button, the about page will say that it's downloading the new update and then always show the correct version number.\n### Versions\n\nAtom    : 1.10.0\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\napm  1.12.5\nnpm  3.10.5\nnode 4.4.5\npython 2.7.10\ngit 2.9.3\n\n![screen shot 2016-08-02 at 2 51 02 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/577345/18295526/faec4a84-7456-11e6-846c-d263cbb8a42e.png)\n![screen shot 2016-09-06 at 5 22 14 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/577345/18295527/faed4be6-7456-11e6-9d9e-ae1867938f5b.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12613","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12613/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12613/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12613/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12613","id":175371811,"number":12613,"title":"Atom closes files not present in current branch","user":{"login":"northamerican","id":6657634,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6657634?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/northamerican","html_url":"https://github.com/northamerican","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/northamerican/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/northamerican/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/northamerican/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/northamerican/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/northamerican/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/northamerican/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/northamerican/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/northamerican/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/northamerican/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-09-06T22:58:05Z","updated_at":"2016-09-15T17:08:07Z","closed_at":"2016-09-15T16:33:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Consider this workflow: I have new files created in a branch. I then stash my unstaged files and checkout another branch to quickly rebase or something. When I return to the original branch, I must reopen my stashed files in Atom because it considered them deleted and closed the tab. In reality they were just in another branch. \n\nOther editors I've used (Sublime, Coda) keep the tab open. Both of them pretend the file still exists and recreates it if saved.

My workaround is to close Atom, switch branch, `git` whatever i got to, then checkout again and reopen Atom, so it preserves my open, still existent file that was never really deleted.\n\nThis issue partially opposes #5394.

Hence, when calling `moveToSuccessor` afterward, we would consume that tag and advance the iterator again, thus effectively moving it twice and causing issues like the aforementioned one.\n\nAn option could be to clip to the left of the textual tag without consuming it. However, this would be a little odd with respect to the current contract of (`DisplayLayer` and) `seek`, whose promise is to move the iterator to a position that is greater or equal than the one asked by the caller.\n\nTherefore, with this pull-request, we are changing the behavior of `seek` in this particular scenario to consume the tag in question and process all its siblings until a tag boundary is finally found. This ensures that the above contract is always respected, while still preserving the \"seek to leftmost tag boundary\" semantics (i.e. notice how in the changed test case, calling `seek` with `Point(0, 1)` is the same as calling it with `Point(0, 3)`).\n\n/cc: @nathansobo \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12610/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12609","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12609/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12609/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12609/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12609","id":175177650,"number":12609,"title":"Incosistent Markdown styling in Atom 1.10.0","user":{"login":"jaranta","id":5079912,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5079912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaranta","html_url":"https://github.com/jaranta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaranta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaranta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaranta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaranta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaranta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaranta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaranta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaranta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaranta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-09-06T07:24:39Z","updated_at":"2016-09-06T07:32:45Z","closed_at":"2016-09-06T07:32:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [X] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n- [X] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [X] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [X] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [X] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [X] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n\nFor more information on how to write a good [bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) or [enhancement request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\nAtom 1.10.0 inconsistently styles Markdown text. I noticed this behavior after upgrading to Atom 1.10.0. The problem is consistent between different themes, so it sounds like a problem in Atom and not in a specific theme.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nI am unable to consistently reproduce the behavior. I have a longer Markdown-document where the styling is consistently broken, but the manner in which it is broken varies when I open a new instance of Atom. I could not reproduce the behavior with a shorter Markdown document, so I am not sure what the trigger is.\n\n**Expected behavior:** Markdown to be styled consistently.\n\n**Actual behavior:** The broken styling looks like this:\n\n![sieppaa](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5079912/18264874/63af4a6c-741b-11e6-980f-ea8a2918d13f.PNG)\n### Versions\n\n`atom --version`:\n\nAtom    :

C:\\Users\\JM\\AppData\\Local\\atom\\bin\\apm\n> \n> C:\\Users\\JM\\AppData\\Local\\atom\\bin\\apm.cmd\n\nThough I am hitting this error in the Atom Packages search.\n\nLooks like `atom.cmd` breaks on the second occurrence of the closing parenthesis: `\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_60\\bin\"` or on the first after `Git\\cmd`, don't know for sure. I've checked by removing both parentheses and just the closing one, it did run without the error both times.\n\nSomehow related to Java installation or update.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nWindows 7, Atom 1.10.0.\n\nThe full `Path` variable contents:\n\n```\nC:\\ProgramData\\Oracle\\Java\\javapath;%SystemRoot%\\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\\System32\\Wbem;%SYSTEMROOT%\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\;C:\\Program Files\\TortoiseGit\\bin;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\cmd;C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python35-32\\Scripts\\;C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python35-32\\;C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm;D:\\_babak\\_programs\\apache-ant-1.9.6\\bin;\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_60\\bin\";D:\\_babak\\_programs\\code_swarm\\bin;C:\\Program Files\\TortoiseHg\\;C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\atom\\bin;D:\\_babak\\_programs\\watchman;%NVM_HOME%;%NVM_SYMLINK%;\"C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre1.8.0_74\\bin\";\"C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_74\\bin\"\n```\n\n`where git` gives:\n\n```\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\cmd\\git.exe\n```\n\n`apm.cmd` contents:\n\n```\n@echo off\nsetlocal enabledelayedexpansion\n\n:: Try to find git.exe in path\nfor /f \"tokens=*\" %%G in ('where git') do set \"apm_git_path=%%~dpG\"\nif not defined apm_git_path (\n  :: Try to find git.exe in GitHub Desktop, oldest first so we end with newest\n  for /f \"tokens=*\" %%d in ('dir /b /s /a:d /od \"%LOCALAPPDATA%\\GitHub\\PortableGit*\"') do (\n    if exist %%d\\cmd\\git.exe set apm_git_path=%%d\\cmd\n  )\n  :: Found one, add it to the path\n  if defined apm_git_path set \"Path=!apm_git_path!;%PATH%\"\n)\n\nset maybe_node_gyp_path=%~dp0\\..\\node_modules\\node-gyp\\bin\\node-gyp.js\nif exist %maybe_node_gyp_path% (\n  set npm_config_node_gyp=%maybe_node_gyp_path%\n)\n\nif exist \"%~dp0\\node.exe\" (\n  \"%~dp0\\node.exe\" \"%~dp0/../lib/cli.js\" %*\n) else (\n  node.exe \"%~dp0/../lib/cli.js\" %*\n)\n```\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n\nThe Atom Package search works without errors.\n\n**Actual behavior:**\n\n`Searching for \"...\" failed.`\n### Versions\n\n`atom --version`\n\n```\nAtom    : 1.10.0\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\n```\n\n`apm --version`\n\n(an error about the \"unexpected\" until I fix the Path variable by removing the closing parenthesis)\n\n```\napm  1.12.5\nnpm  3.10.5\nnode 4.4.5\npython 3.5.0\ngit 1.9.4.msysgit.1\nvisual studio\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12608/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12607","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12607/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12607/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12607/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12607","id":175082624,"number":12607,"title":"Special \"light\" mode for fast git start","user":{"login":"rugk","id":11966684,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/11966684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rugk","html_url":"https://github.com/rugk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rugk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rugk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rugk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rugk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rugk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rugk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rugk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rugk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rugk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-09-05T14:27:27Z","updated_at":"2016-11-04T03:07:51Z","closed_at":"2016-11-04T03:07:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I would really like to use Atom for editing commit messages of git, however I have one big problem: With a lot of packages installed Atom is just _veery_ slow.\n\nThis is why I'd propose to add a special `git-start` mode of Atom.
