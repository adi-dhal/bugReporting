PR aims to enable CSP for Atom to prevent XSS that leads to command execution via Node.  This initial pass unfortunately requires us setting the `unsafe-eval` value for the `script-src` directive.  This seems to be needed in order for the dev spec tests to be able to auto-generate some JS via `eval()`.  The stack trace can be found below. So, it would be nice if we could come up with a way to allow unit tests to run without having to directly inherit the CSP policy.  Also, I still need to add a few unit tests.  I just wanted to post the PR early so that folks could chime it regarding anything they think might break, workarounds for any issues that come up, etc.\n\n@nathansobo @thedaniel @mastahyeti @gregose

Extensions such as markdown-preview take a string of HTML and render it in a div within the main Atom UI.  As a result, the HTML is rendered in the same context as the rest of Atom (with Node integration).  While CSP should mitigate much of the risk associated with this, it doesn't totally solve the \"render untrusted HTML\" issue.  For example, user content could potentially still break the DOM of the main Atom app. So, we could just ask that markdown-preview use a sandboxed iframe to minimize the issues that could arise from rendering user provided content.  But, I was thinking it might be a nice API primitive if we allowed any extension to hand us a string of HTML and we render it for them. I'm not sure how extensible this would need to be (ex. does the rendered HTML inherit CSS styles from the outer frame, etc), but it does seem like a nice security API.\n\n@kevinsawicki @mcolyer @nathansobo @gregose @mastahyeti \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1684/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1683","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1683/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1683/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1683/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/1683","id":28723506,"number":1683,"title":"npm ca issue","user":{"login":"kevinsawicki","id":671378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/671378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinsawicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-03-04T17:20:37Z","updated_at":"2014-07-25T03:44:38Z","closed_at":"2014-03-04T18:32:53Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/1683","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/1683","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/1683.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/1683.patch"},"body":"In a rush to get things working again when the [npm cert](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/78085451721/npms-self-signed-certificate-is-no-more) issue happened I disabled strict ssl checking since the jankys use the version of npm that was broken.\n\nAfter more research we could just use a custom `.npmrc` file during the atom bootstrap that sets `ca` to an empty string and also starts caching modules in `~/.atom/.npm` so that it can be cleaned when we want to reset CI.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1682","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1682/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1682/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1682/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/1682","id":28722681,"number":1682,"title":"Enable CSP by default","user":{"login":"ptoomey3","id":103360,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103360?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoomey3","html_url":"https://github.com/ptoomey3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoomey3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoomey3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoomey3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoomey3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoomey3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoomey3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoomey3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoomey3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptoomey3/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-03-04T17:10:14Z","updated_at":"2014-05-05T21:57:26Z","closed_at":"2014-03-11T20:28:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"XSS in Atom can directly lead to local command execution on a user's machine.
