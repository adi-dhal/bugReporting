If I close this new window again, then drag another file from that same directory (still outside of the project directory) into the original window, again a new window opens, but this time with the file that I just dragged AND the one that I dragged before (and closed again). So it seems, atom is internally creating something like a project and stores which files were opened from that directory.\n- Even more interestingly, something similar happens when dragging files from the current project directory: A new window is opened for this file, too, but it also contains all the files that were open in the original window.

The TextEvent object field 'newText' does not include the newline character, it is an empty String.\n2. The oldRange values are incorrect for the end/start fields.

If the UI is setup, it could be as easy as calling an external debugger with the command line.\n\nIt's this way for autocorrect in Atom: I can have different autocomplete packages that all function

If I leave that file open in Atom and regenerate the code, which is done by redirecting stdout from a Python script, Atom will regularly hang or outright crash.  Sometimes you can do this a half dozen times, other times it will hang or crash on the first rewrite of the file.\n\nExpected behavior is to refresh and reload the file in Atom.\n\nAs seen in Atom 1.0.6 and 1.2.4 on Ubuntu 15.04.  Happens in safe mode as well.\n\nAlso reproducible in OSX with Atom 1.2.2 and 1.2.4.  Will be attaching the crash logs from Console.app shortly.\n\nHow I can reliably reproduce the bug (requires Python 2.7, `pip install html2text`):\n\nFrom the https://github.com/DualSpark/rusoto/tree/feature-better-s3-codegen branch, run: \n\n``` bash\ngit submodule init\ngit submodule update\n```\n\n``` bash\ncd codegen\n./botocore_parser_s3.py botocore/botocore/data/s3/2006-03-01/service-2.json S3Client > s3.rs\n```\n\nThat generates the code.  Now, open `codegen/s3.rs` in Atom and re-run the `./botocore_parser_s3.py botocore/botocore/data/s3/2006-03-01/service-2.json S3Client > s3.rs` command.  Atom will hang reloading the file, or crash outright.  If it doesn't crash or hang, running the command a few more times will cause a hang or crash.  Once or twice for Ubuntu, four to five times for OSX.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9825/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9824","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9824/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9824/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9824/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9824","id":118925366,"number":9824,"title":"OSX 10.10.5 - Files locking up on smb connection","user":{"login":"jq-87","id":609653,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/609653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jq-87","html_url":"https://github.com/jq-87","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jq-87/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jq-87/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jq-87/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jq-87/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jq-87/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jq-87/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jq-87/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jq-87/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jq-87/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":192100748,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/network","name":"network","color":"f7c6c7","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2015-11-25T21:16:14Z","updated_at":"2017-02-17T10:13:59Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm editing files on a mounted volume (connected via SMB). \n\nWhen I try to discard changes on a file w/ Git the file locks up and i get a \"Permission Denied\" message in atom.
