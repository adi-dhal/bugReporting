posted on this topic before but it seems to have disappeared from the issues list.  Are they sometimes totally deleted instead of closed?  I used `author:mark-hahn` as the filter and saw all postings I can remember.\n\nAnyway, I have had a problem where the command window in windows doesn't return to the prompt when I start atom in the command line.  It just shows stdout with a prefix of `[5796:1120/164636:INFO:CONSOLE(72)]`.  This is the opposite problem noted in another issue where the `--wait` doesn't work.\n\nThis problem comes and goes but it just reappeared when I installed Atom 0.149.0 with the new windows squirrel installer.  It might be a coincidence of course.\n\nSome sample output ...\n\n```\nC:\\>atom\nApp load time: 176ms\n[9036:1120/164633:INFO:renderer_main.cc(204)] Renderer process started\n[5796:1120/164636:INFO:CONSOLE(64)] \"Window load time: 2756ms\", source: file:///C:/Users/Administrator/AppData/Local/atom/app-0.15\n0.0/resources/app/static/index.js (64)\n[5796:1120/164636:INFO:CONSOLE(72)] \"RESPONDER:\", source: C:\\apps\\autocomplete\\js\\ipc.js (72)\n[5796:1120/164636:INFO:CONSOLE(72)] \"RESPONDER:\", source: C:\\apps\\autocomplete\\js\\ipc.js (72)\n[5796:1120/164637:INFO:CONSOLE(72)] \"RESPONDER:\", source: C:\\apps\\autocomplete\\js\\ipc.js (72)\n[5796:1120/164637:INFO:CONSOLE(72)] \"RESPONDER:\", source: C:\\apps\\autocomplete\\js\\ipc.js (72)\n[5796:1120/164637:INFO:CONSOLE(72)] \"RESPONDER:\", source: C:\\apps\\autocomplete\\js\\ipc.js (72)\n```\n## Versions\n- **Atom:**       0.150.0\n- **Atom-Shell:** 0.19.2\n- **OS:**         Microsoft Windows 8.1 Pro with Media Center\n- **Misc**\n  - \u001bapm\u001b  \u001b0.111.0\u001b\n  - \u001bnpm\u001b  \u001b1.4.4\u001b\n  - \u001bnode\u001b \u001b0.10.33\u001b\n  - \u001bpython\u001b \u001b2.7.8\u001b\n  - \u001bgit\u001b \u001b1.7.11.msysgit.1\u001b\n  - \u001bvisual studio\u001b \u001b2013\u001b\n\n---\n\n<small>This report was created in and posted from the Atom editor using the package `bug-report` version 0.4.1.</small>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4266","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4266/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4266/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4266/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4266","id":49637584,"number":4266,"title":"Improper space behavior","user":{"login":"mark-hahn","id":811455,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/811455?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn","html_url":"https://github.com/mark-hahn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":84710475,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/editor-rendering","name":"editor-rendering","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-11-21T00:33:26Z","updated_at":"2017-06-08T23:42:13Z","closed_at":"2017-06-08T23:42:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In a specific situation the space key puts a space in the buffer properly but the display doesn't update.
