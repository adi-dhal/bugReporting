currently loads a package's stylesheets when activated even for packages using activation events.\n\nThis can cause atom to have a delayed startup since it is too eagerly loading things it might not even use.  Now that we have less caching going on it is even more important to only load stylesheets when needed.\n\nIf packages are using activation events it should signal that they don't need their stylesheets actually loaded until right before `activate` is called on their package main.\n\nA good example of where this can speed things up is the markdown preview.  It has a pretty hefty stylesheet that is loaded immediately at startup even though it isn't used until a markdown file is previewed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/879","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/879/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/879/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/879/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/879","id":20019410,"number":879,"title":"Upgrade collaboration","user":{"login":"kevinsawicki","id":671378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/671378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinsawicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2013-09-25T02:48:18Z","updated_at":"2013-09-25T02:50:56Z","closed_at":"2013-09-25T02:50:52Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/879","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/879","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/879.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/879.patch"},"body":"Gets it back working\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/878","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/878/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/878/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/878/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/878","id":20015068,"number":878,"title":"Add API for interacting with Keymap","user":{"login":"mcolyer","id":1424,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1424?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer","html_url":"https://github.com/mcolyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2013-09-25T00:09:22Z","updated_at":"2013-09-26T20:26:05Z","closed_at":"2013-09-26T20:26:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/878","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/878","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/878.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/878.patch"},"body":"Adds several getter methods required to view the keymap.

Currently it only reports whether it's in devMode and the error and the line on which the failure occurs and the user-agent (Atom version). I believe even this minimal information will be valuable to us in two cases:\n- If errors spike after releasing we know we've regressed\n- We can examine individual errors by version and attempt to find bugs\n- Possibly provide explanations if users stop using atom\n\nI originally proposed sending this data to haystack but there was some concern about the security of doing that since any secret key we would include would be easily snoopable by others.\n\nAlso the reason we don't include a backtrace is that we can't until atom/atom-shell#86 lands. I think we should merge this and if there aren't any objections/suggestions I plan on doing so in the next day or so.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/868","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/868/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/868/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/868/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/868","id":19880769,"number":868,"title":"Timecop","user":{"login":"kevinsawicki","id":671378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/671378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinsawicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2013-09-22T22:33:26Z","updated_at":"2014-07-15T21:48:34Z","closed_at":"2013-09-23T23:14:11Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/868","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/868","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/868.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/868.patch"},"body":"Adds
