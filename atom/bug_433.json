Font rendering is a bit different on OS X when the GPU is employed due to issues with subpixel anti-aliasing, so this allows it to be disabled at the cost of performance if the user truly can't stand it. If we get a lot of complaints, we may want to auto-disable the GPU on non-retina displays.\n- Fixes #2769. It seems like there are bugs on Linux with certain graphics drivers. A quick workaround is just disabling the GPU entirely. Hopefully these issues will be addressed as Chromium evolves.\n\n![gpu-disabled](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1789/3447052/1d6c4bd2-0149-11e4-9ee0-3048230eb77c.gif)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2788","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2788/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2788/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2788/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2788","id":36915877,"number":2788,"title":"Add

the installation directory with an argument to `script/build` (eg: `script/build --install-path /some/path`) or alternatively, to either remove the install option from default build tasks or accept a command line argument that prevents installation (eg: `script/build --no-install`).\n\nI think an even better option is for `script/build` to stick to just _build_ and another script (like

This is continued like so, as long as the closing parenthesis match an existing opening parenthesis, otherwise a closing parenthesis is inserted at the position of the cursor.\n\nIn Atom though, a new closing parenthesis is always inserted at the cursor's position.\n\nIt would be a great feature if the cursor would move just one position per closing parenthesis entered as long as it matches an

Seti Monokai theme is no longer available in the repositories of its creator, @joaoafrmartins (https://github.com/joaoafrmartins). he's removed the repository. when you try and download it through the Settings pane in Atom, you naturally get the following error —\n\n```\nInstalling “seti-monokai@0.0.0” failed. Less…\nUnable to download https://www.atom.io/api/packages/seti-monokai/versions/0.0.0/tarball: 400 Bad Request Repository inaccessible\n```\n\n@joaoafrmartins provides no e-mail or method of contacting him on his github page. the Seti Monokai theme should be removed until such time as he reposts it and is more communicative.\n\nbest,\n\n—  faddah wolf\n     portland, oregon, u.s.a.\n     github.com/faddah\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2770","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2770/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2770/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2770/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2770","id":36756577,"number":2770,"title":"Multiline-mini-editor","user":{"login":"Azeirah","id":4040870,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4040870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azeirah","html_url":"https://github.com/Azeirah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azeirah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azeirah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azeirah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azeirah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azeirah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azeirah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azeirah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azeirah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azeirah/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-06-29T20:50:21Z","updated_at":"2017-08-14T21:32:51Z","closed_at":"2017-08-14T21:32:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It's possible to create a single-line mini-editor, but it is not yet possible to create a multi-line mini-editor.\n\nCreating a full-fledged editor in small Atom packages is overkill, while the mini-editor is far too small.\n\nHereby I pledge to the Atom gods to give us a way to create a multi-line mini editor.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2770/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2769","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2769/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2769/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2769/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2769","id":36755447,"number":2769,"title":"Scroll jitter in React editor","user":{"login":"flannelhead","id":5001906,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5001906?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flannelhead","html_url":"https://github.com/flannelhead","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flannelhead/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flannelhead/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flannelhead/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flannelhead/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flannelhead/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flannelhead/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flannelhead/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flannelhead/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flannelhead/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":97577987,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/linux","name":"linux","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-06-29T20:07:49Z","updated_at":"2014-07-02T15:27:14Z","closed_at":"2014-07-01T18:48:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"On Xubuntu 14.04 64-bit, Atom commit f5517bad66c0c7846cbc2222ff4f5b19cde76e1c:\n\nIn React editor, when I give the editor a good scroll with the mouse wheel, occasionally the scroll gets stuck and jittering in some position for a while.
