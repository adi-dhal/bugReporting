Since the manner in which platforms handle menus is sufficiently different I think that part is necessary. That said, I would prefer to keep the menu configuration in packages cross platform.\n\nThis presents a bit of a challenge because Windows uses `&` to allow navigation through menus via the keyboard. The way that it works is that a user presses `alt` and then windows focuses the menu and underlines characters which indicates the next selection. This means that there needs to be an underlined character for each menu item and it has to be unique within the currently visible menu.\n\nSo I propose that during The Great Package Rewrite, that one of the steps that we do is specify an underlined character for all menu items and then strip it on platforms that don't support it (ie darwin and linux). I've worked around this for now by adding a `normalizeLabel` function which allows us to specify top-level menu item's underline character and packages can still merge their menu items appropriately.\n\n@paulcbetts if you'd like to go into menus/win32.cson and add ampersands where you think most appropriate that would be
