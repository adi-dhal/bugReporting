I just upgraded my version of Atom to 1.17.0-beta0, and I'm having a little trouble with several packages. Since I'm not sure if the behavior reflects an intentional change to Atom's API or not, I wanted to confirm before filing issues with the individual developers.\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to be that before an editor view has been opened, the function `getModel` is not defined on editor elements. This causes crashes in a number of packages that rely on `atom-space-pen-views` (I think [`text-editor-view.coffee:24`](https://github.com/atom/atom-space-pen-views/blob/master/src/text-editor-view.coffee#L24) is the problem line), and at least one ([`foldingtext-for-atom`](https://github.com/FoldingText/foldingtext-for-atom)) that does not. For example, I normally open a fresh window with \"Empty Editor On Start\" disabled, invoke the Project Manager package, pick a project, and do my business; now, since I haven't opened a tab yet, pulling up Project Manager throws an error like this one:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAt /Users/daniel/.atom/packages/project-manager/node_modules/atom-space-pen-views/lib/text-editor-view.js:40\r\n\r\nTypeError: this.element.getModel is not a function\r\n    at /packages/project-manager/node_modules/atom-space-pen-views/lib/text-editor-view.js:40:34)\r\n    at Object.content (/packages/project-manager/node_modules/atom-space-pen-views/lib/select-list-view.js:26:45)\r\n    at Builder.tag (/packages/project-manager/node_modules/space-pen/lib/space-pen.js:281:19)\r\n    at /packages/project-manager/node_modules/space-pen/lib/space-pen.js:83:49)\r\n    at Function.module.exports.SelectListView.content (/packages/project-manager/node_modules/atom-space-pen-views/lib/select-list-view.js:22:19)\r\n    at /packages/project-manager/node_modules/space-pen/lib/space-pen.js:156:31)\r\n    at Function.View.buildHtml (/packages/project-manager/node_modules/space-pen/lib/space-pen.js:123:10)\r\n    at /packages/project-manager/node_modules/space-pen/lib/space-pen.js:155:33)\r\n    at /packages/project-manager/node_modules/atom-space-pen-views/lib/select-list-view.js:18:51)\r\n    at /packages/project-manager/lib/views/projects-list-view.js:10:38)\r\n    at /packages/project-manager/lib/project-manager.js:34:28)\r\n    at CommandRegistry.module.exports.CommandRegistry.handleCommandEvent (/Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/command-registry.js:265:1)\r\n    at /Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/command-registry.js:3:1\r\n    at KeymapManager.module.exports.KeymapManager.dispatchCommandEvent (/Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/atom-keymap/lib/keymap-manager.js:610:1)\r\n    at KeymapManager.module.exports.KeymapManager.handleKeyboardEvent (/Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/atom-keymap/lib/keymap-manager.js:401:1)\r\n    at WindowEventHandler.module.exports.WindowEventHandler.handleDocumentKeyEvent (/Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/window-event-handler.js:100:1)\r\n    at HTMLDocument.<anonymous> (/Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/window-event-handler.js:3:1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith FoldingText installed at all, opening a new Atom window throws this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAt /Users/daniel/.atom/packages/foldingtext-for-atom/lib/extensions/ui/text-input-element.coffee:19\r\n\r\nTypeError: this.textEditorElement.getModel is not a function\r\n    at /packages/foldingtext-for-atom/lib/extensions/ui/text-input-element.coffee:19:38)\r\n    at Object.exports.consumeStatusBarService (/packages/foldingtext-for-atom/lib/extensions/search-status-bar-item.coffee:9:28)\r\n    at Object.addStatusBarItemsIfReady (/packages/foldingtext-for-atom/lib/foldingtext.coffee:139:53)\r\n    at Object.consumeStatusBarService (/packages/foldingtext-for-atom/lib/foldingtext.coffee:130:6)\r\n    at Provider.module.exports.Provider.provide (/Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/service-hub/lib/provider.js:34:1)\r\n    at ServiceHub.module.exports.ServiceHub.provide (/Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/service-hub/lib/service-hub.js:30:1)\r\n    at Package.module.exports.Package.activateServices (/Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/package.js:446:1)\r\n    at Package.module.exports.Package.activateNow (/Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/package.js:256:1)\r\n    at /Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/package.js:225:1\r\n    at Package.module.exports.Package.measure (/Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/package.js:99:1)\r\n    at /Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/package.js:218:1\r\n    at Package.module.exports.Package.activate (/Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/package.js:215:1)\r\n    at PackageManager.module.exports.PackageManager.activatePackage (/Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/package-manager.js:642:1)\r\n    at /Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/package-manager.js:623:1\r\n    at Config.module.exports.Config.transactAsync (/Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/config.js:346:1)\r\n    at PackageManager.module.exports.PackageManager.activatePackages (/Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/package-manager.js:618:1)\r\n    at PackageManager.module.exports.PackageManager.activate (/Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/package-manager.js:600:1)\r\n    at /Applications/Atom Beta.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/atom-environment.js:831:1\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the moment, uninstalling FoldingText and reenabling \"Empty Editor On Start\" seems to be a serviceable workaround.

Rename by right-clicking on the tab > rename to \"file2\"\r\n4a. close the tab -> atom asks to save the file. choosing yes will create a file named \"file1\"\r\n4b. add some text and press Ctrl+S -> will create a file named \"file1\" with the updated content. \"file2\" will be the old state of \"file1\"\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Rename action shoud be picked up by the editor and the open file should be the \"new\" one\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Only moves the file but atom ignores it\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nDebian Stretch\r\nAtom 1.15 x64\r\nBlank atom state (.atom directory removed before testing)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14186","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14186/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14186/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14186/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14186","id":221324423,"number":14186,"title":"resizing window with docks doesn't resize proportionally ","user":{"login":"ungb","id":5624870,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5624870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb","html_url":"https://github.com/ungb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-04-12T16:48:04Z","updated_at":"2017-04-12T16:59:36Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nresizing window with docks doesn't resize proportionally \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce (this is easier to repro on windows than mac)\r\n\r\n1.
