(_Updated_)\r\n\r\n1. Install the `docks-test` package found here: [docks-test.zip](https://github.com/atom/atom/files/1109683/docks-test.zip)\r\n2. Install `atom-material-ui`. Tested with v2.0.4.\r\n3. Open a file.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nNo graphical bugs with the Dock item.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\nWhen the \"flow in\" animation for the Dock toggle finishes a rectangular shaped region of the screen as high as the button but much wider will appear colored in the `@app-background-color` (I think), sometimes it will have content from the status bar showing in the bar. This status bar content is _not_ from the area \"under\" the bar, so it's not something that is getting translated up with the button.\r\n\r\n\"Normal\" blank bar:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/427137/27649520-e67c8668-5be6-11e7-896d-38285a96c1b9.png)\r\n\r\nStatus bar content:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/427137/27649153-d0a616a2-5be5-11e7-9b60-f0499731681a.png)\r\n\r\nGIF:\r\n![2017-06-28_09-48-51](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/427137/27649602-1607e576-5be7-11e7-9487-c512ba257bf7.gif)\r\n\r\nNote that with the updated steps to reproduce the behavior is actually worse than shown in the screenshots as the window starts out with a glitched rendering bar:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/427137/27652328-239b7a78-5bf0-11e7-83ac-a714a4f3488f.png)\r\n\r\nThere is actually a line number hidden behind the bar as well, as can be seen (briefly) in this GIF:\r\n![2017-06-28_10-55-14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/427137/27652371-4b9adafa-5bf0-11e7-9978-912ad8265ab2.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:**\r\n\r\nAlmost all windows seem to eventually show this behavior, but I can't determine a reliable way to reproduce this.\r\n\r\n- I can't seem to replicate in safe mode, or with a stock theme (One Dark).\r\n- I use `atom-material-ui` with One Dark Syntax.\r\n- ~~This _might_ be dependent on `linter-ui-default`,~~ but it may just be that that is the only bottom Dock item that I usually have running.\r\n- I only ever see a brief flash of the right side Dock toggle showing this when Atom is loading, once loaded I don't see it from that toggle.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n I've seen this since at least v1.18.0 betas, possibly since v1.17.0 betas.\r\n\r\nCurrently seeing this in:\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.19.0-beta2\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    :

This changed the way I had previously installed to now installed in `$HOME\\AppData\\Local` which is great. My existing packages survived, but I was getting  errors when updating packages. I also cannot install packages. I can reproduce this reliably and I have reset to factory defaults (removed `.atom\\`) and this problem persists.\r\n\r\nThe error appears to be related to the failed creation of the \"apm-install\" directory under `$HOME\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\`.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Click `Install` on any community package\r\n2. Wait\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Package installs\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Install fails\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 92.732%\r\n\r\nThis might reproduce 40 times in a row, then work 4 in a row. \r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n`>atom --version`\r\n> \r\n>Atom    : 1.18.0\r\n>Electron: 1.3.15\r\n>Chrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\n>Node    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\n`>apm --version`\r\n>apm  1.18.1\r\n>npm  3.10.10\r\n>node 6.9.5 x64\r\n>python\r\n>git\r\n>visual studio\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nError output from failed install:\r\n\r\n> Installing “vim-mode-plus@0.93.0” failed.Hide output…\r\n> C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\apm-install-dir-117528-20320-xdopcx.9igkl0udi\r\n> `-- (empty)\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> npm WARN enoent ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\apm-install-dir-117528-20320-xdopcx.9igkl0udi\\package.json'\r\n> npm WARN apm-install-dir-117528-20320-xdopcx.9igkl0udi No description\r\n> npm WARN apm-install-dir-117528-20320-xdopcx.9igkl0udi No repository field.\r\n> npm WARN apm-install-dir-117528-20320-xdopcx.9igkl0udi No README data\r\n> npm WARN apm-install-dir-117528-20320-xdopcx.9igkl0udi No license field.\r\n> npm ERR!

word in IME panel. But from 1.19.0 (maybe beta 1), the cursor always stucks at the first letter. Although I can still type Chinese correctly under the circumstances., it is more helpful to see what you are typing out.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** \r\n\r\nIn 1.18.0, it looks well.\r\n\r\n![atom](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14314532/27643849-ccf636da-5c54-11e7-9111-e7b09469cf10.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** \r\n\r\nHowever, the cursor moves no more in 1.19.0-beta2.\r\n\r\n![atom-beta](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14314532/27643959-0f04396e-5c55-11e7-838c-ac15ef580fbe.gif)\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** every time\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nOS: macOS Sierra 10.12.5\r\nAtom    : 1.19.0-beta2\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nAt first, I dived into source code to search for the problem. Soon, I overwhelmed with the large codebase of Atom. I cannot figure out which commit producing this bug. If anyone can point out which part may produce this problem, I can help to solve it. Thanks

https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSometimes when updating packages, Atom loses most of its settings. E.g. right now, I updated Hyperclick, and after the restart I was greeted with the welcome message, my font was reset to the default settings, my settings for linter-pycodestyle and linter-pylint were lost, and I assume all the others as well, but I didn't bother with the rest much, so no impact there in my case.\r\n\r\nThis is difficult to reproduce; I can update packages dozens of times, but every once in a while, it loses all my settings. It's not a disk full issue, as I have 56GB available.\r\n\r\nThe data loss appears to be limited to the things in ~/.atom/config.cson - the other .cson files and styles.less appear to be unaffected.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Update packages\r\n2. Restart\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Atom restarts with upgraded packages, and settings intact.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Atom restarts with upgraded packages, and lost settings.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Less than 10%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nAtom    : 1.18.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.15\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\napm  1.18.1\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode

Description\r\n\r\nSo excited as i was, i wanted to see the new github feature. After my commit and stuff, i wanted to push my code to github, which asks for a username/password. If i fill in the form with the correct username/password i get a password invalid. \r\n\r\nI figured it had to do something with 2FA, so i disabled it. \r\nAfter disabling is, it works like a charm, except that my accounts isn't safe.\r\n\r\nIf you could fix the issue, i'll try to add my SSH key to see if i can work around the issue. \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. enable 2FA\r\n2. Push to repo\r\n3. try to login.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\nI expected Atom to push my new code\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\nI stuck on the login screen\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\n100% of the time.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nAtom    : 1.18.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.15\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\nOS: OSX Sierra, 10.12.5 (16F73)\r\nMacbook pro touchbar\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nNone\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14904/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4200","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507404130","x-github-request-id":"9105:3670:9E9729:1985B8B:59D9277C","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=32>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=30>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"f8a942d22dd8263ac46ef8565238b138\"","status":"200 OK"}}
