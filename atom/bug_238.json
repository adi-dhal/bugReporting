Thus, if we had a string like the following in the buffer:\n\n```\n{someLetter}{nullByte}{variationSelector}\n```\n\n`TokenIterator::isPairedCharacter` returned true for `{nullByte}{variationSelector}`.\n\nAlthough I _suspect_ it would be technically possible for null bytes to be paired with other unicode characters, as soon as we insert a null byte into the DOM it gets ripped off. \n\nThis screwed up our measurement mechanism, which wasn't able to match DOM positions against the model. A solution for this could have been to substitute [this line](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/lines-tile-component.coffee#L346) with:\n\n``` coffee\ncontinue if char.indexOf('\\0')\n```\n\nHowever, this would skip the whole paired character and it's inconsistent with what gets displayed to the user. This PR changes the behavior of `isPairedCharacter` so that it skips null bytes when detecting pair code points.\n\n/cc: @maxbrunsfeld @nathansobo @atom/feedback for :eyes: \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8660/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8659","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8659/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8659/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8659/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8659","id":104751522,"number":8659,"title":"Pointer is nearly invisible when using a dark syntax theme","user":{"login":"ravinggenius","id":21517,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/21517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinggenius","html_url":"https://github.com/ravinggenius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinggenius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinggenius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinggenius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinggenius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinggenius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinggenius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinggenius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinggenius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinggenius/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-09-03T18:07:11Z","updated_at":"2015-09-03T19:13:42Z","closed_at":"2015-09-03T18:57:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When using the Atom Dark syntax theme, the pointer is very difficult to see.

However when you collapse project tree, a project name isn't highlighted. Because of that I have to unfold each project's directories tree to check whether I've made some changes. I'm working on several connected projects in the same time so that's why I think such feature would be handy. What do you think? :)\n\nIt would also be nice to have, next to the project name, an indicator showing how many commits have been made and are waiting to be pushed and what branch I'm currently on.

[The \"font stack\" solution currently implemented](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8612) hardcodes a bunch of fonts in the hope that the default font for every possible installation is included. This is not a big issue on Mac and Windows where it is ~~impossible~~ almost impossible – and very unusual – to change the system font.\n\nNot so on Linux. As an example, I use Fedora which comes with Cantarell by default. I don't like Cantarell and have changed my system font to Source Sans Pro instead (easily done in GNOME). All of my desktop applications respect the change, except Atom because it has Cantarell hardcoded in its font stack and since Cantarell is still present on my system it is used instead.\n\nThe solution is to make Atom use the system fonts like other desktop applications. Instead of guessing which font the user wants, it should query the system for the default font to use. IMO this should also extend to the fixed-width font and themes explicitly setting the font family should be the exception rather than the rule. No matter which theme I choose, there is almost never a good reason for one application to use a different font than the others.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8656/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8655","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8655/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8655/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8655/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8655","id":104739473,"number":8655,"title":"Delete behavior of nested brackets.","user":{"login":"scv119","id":837180,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/837180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scv119","html_url":"https://github.com/scv119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scv119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scv119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scv119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scv119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scv119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scv119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scv119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scv119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scv119/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-09-03T17:00:17Z","updated_at":"2015-09-08T16:31:00Z","closed_at":"2015-09-08T16:31:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If I delete a pair nested brackets, the behavior seems strange:\n\nRepo...\nWrite this...\n\n```\n(foo())\n```\n\nPlace the cursor\n\n```\n(foo()|)\n```\n\nPress backspace\n\n```\n(foo(|)\n```\n\nPress backspace\n\n```\n(foo|\n```\n\nHmmm!!!
