All items are configured very specifically to instructions. I even tried using the ip address of the proxy to eliminate the possibility of a dns issue as suggested. Everything works fine unless it is calling npm. That is when the git connection fails.\n\nOnce those are added, the settings view can see all the packages available, search etc. (without this I get a connection error). However when calling git on package install it fails to connect. I can call git from the command line and from other applications without issue since the global git proxy configuration is set.

Whenever I install a new package, I have to rebind the keybindings I set in my custom keymap.cson because they got overwritten (again) by some package. Maybe I want my custom keybindings instead of the ones provided by the package, but I don't see an option for just disabling some of them. Also some core keybindings are just useless for me, so I would like to disable them.\n\nExample:\nThere's this package 'Project manager' and i want to use ctrl+alt+shift+P as a keybinding for the packages toggle command. I want this to work no matter what element is focused. But when .workspace .editor is focused, this keybinding activates editor:log-cursor-scope. Now I have to bind 'project-managre:toggle' again within '.workspace .editor'.

Apparently node-gyp is somewhat problematic.\n- It seems to depend on python 2.6 (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21155922/error-installing-node-gyp-on-ubuntu) \n- and creates problems with some versions of nodejs(https://discuss.atom.io/t/node-gyp-is-failing/9245/4?u=lhk). \n\nAt the beginning my python version was 2.7. This is what I did:\n1. I removed atom and nodejs and reinstalled the newest versions of each (nodejs from source). The error is still there\n2. I installed node-gyp and runas with npm. The error is still there.\n3. I removed everything and installed it from the chris-lea ppa. The error persists\n4. I removed everything, added the deadsnakes ppa, set my python to the old 2.6 version, and checked which version is run by the python command in the terminal - its 2.6. Then I reinstalled nodejs from source. Set the python path to 2.6 with npm config. And reinstalled node-gyp. The error is still there.\n5. I removed everything, except for the old python setup. And installed nodejs from the chris-lea ppa. Same problem.\n6. I removed ~/.atom/.node-gyp/ and reinstalled it with npm\n\nBetween each step I did an npm cache clean and reinstalled the newest version of atom.\n\nnode-gyp rebuild in my atom packages directory fails each time. And I can't install the autocomplete-clang package. Same error.\nThe error message suggests a problem with runas. Therefore, in each step I also installed runas via npm.\n\nThis is really burning a lot of time and I'm all out of ideas.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3772/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3771","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3771/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3771/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3771/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3771","id":45340135,"number":3771,"title":"Failed install on Ubuntu 14.04 (\"script/mkdeb: line 45: fakeroot: command not found\")","user":{"login":"matkoniecz","id":899988,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/899988?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matkoniecz","html_url":"https://github.com/matkoniecz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matkoniecz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matkoniecz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matkoniecz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matkoniecz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matkoniecz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matkoniecz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matkoniecz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matkoniecz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matkoniecz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-10-09T08:29:57Z","updated_at":"2014-10-09T15:56:10Z","closed_at":"2014-10-09T15:56:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"32bit, LXDE, I followed instructions from https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/docs/build-instructions/linux.md\n\n```\nmateusz@Grisznak:~$ sudo apt-get install build-essential git libgnome-keyring-dev\nReading package lists...

Two copies of the exact same module are required and loaded instead of them sharing that exact same dependency.\n\nSo if underscore 1.7 takes 10 milliseconds to require and 10 packages you've installed are using it, Atom will spend 100 milliseconds at startup requiring 10 identical copies, instead of requiring it once and sharing that copy among the 10 packages.\n\nThis has led package authors to do the following performance hacks:\n\n``` js\nrequire(path.join(atom.getLoadSettings().resourcePath, 'node_modules', 'underscore'))\n```\n\nThis requires it directly out of core and so it will only loaded once since the full path is given to `require`.\n\nThis hack has the downside of packages breaking when Atom core upgrades or removes dependencies.\n## The Solution\n\nPatch node's [Module](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/25702abc5638bbecffa92e8349d2a871a5f592c9/lib/module.js#L321) to allow packages to share modules.\n\nSo if a package is dependent on underscore `>= 1.5` and underscore `1.7` has already been loaded by core or another package, that already required underscore version will be used instead of loading a new copy out of the package's `node_modules` folder.\n\nThis is accomplished by doing the following:\n- Precompute all the dependencies a package ships with when it is installed so Atom can track which version of modules are available across all packages and core.\n- Precompute what modules each folder in a package depends on. That way when any file is required in that folder, Atom can immediately know what module versions it needs and return a version from the cache if a compatible version has already been required.\n\nSo by patching `Module._resolveFilename`, Atom can find a compatible version of a module already loaded without stat-ing or reading any files on disk.\n\nIt instead uses the precomputed dependency graph to be able to immediately resolve a module name and version to the path of a compatible version that has already been required.\n\nPackages won't have to do anything to take advantage of this, it will be automatically detected during `apm install` and handled transparently.\n\nPackages will still always get a version of the module that satisfies the dependency range listed in their `package.json` file.\n\nThe apm changes are in https://github.com/atom/apm/pull/200\n## The Results\n\nTo verify that this approach improved startup time I decided to measure the load and activate time for several packages.  These packages were chosen because they are all dependent on at least one module and they have similar dependencies to the modules bundled with Atom and/or each other.\n### Before\n\n| Package | Load/Activate Time in Milliseconds |\n| :-- | --: |\n| [atom-color-highlight](https://atom.io/packages/atom-color-highlight) | 176 |\n| [hex](https://atom.io/packages/hex) | 12 |\n| [minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap) | 97 |\n| [minimap-color-highlight](https://atom.io/packages/minimap-color-highlight) | 108 |\n| [minimap-git-diff](https://atom.io/packages/minimap-git-diff) | 17 |\n| [minimap-selection](https://atom.io/packages/minimap-selection) | 4 |\n| **Total** | **414** |\n### After\n\n| Package | Load/Activate Time in Milliseconds |\n| :-- | --: |\n| [atom-color-highlight](https://atom.io/packages/atom-color-highlight) | 31 |\n| [hex](https://atom.io/packages/hex) | 2 |\n| [minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap) | 69 |\n| [minimap-color-highlight](https://atom.io/packages/minimap-color-highlight) | 7 |\n| [minimap-git-diff](https://atom.io/packages/minimap-git-diff) | 4 |\n| [minimap-selection](https://atom.io/packages/minimap-selection) | 3 |\n| **Total** | **116** |\n\n/cc @abe33 since I used a bunch of your packages in my testing\n\nCloses #3672\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3761/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3760","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3760/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3760/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3760/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3760","id":45282511,"number":3760,"title":"Cannot get atom to consistently print pipe \"|\" character with Faroese and Danish keyboard layouts","user":{"login":"Sl0vi","id":2778582,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2778582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sl0vi","html_url":"https://github.com/Sl0vi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sl0vi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sl0vi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sl0vi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sl0vi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sl0vi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sl0vi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sl0vi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sl0vi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sl0vi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-10-08T18:59:43Z","updated_at":"2014-10-10T15:05:48Z","closed_at":"2014-10-10T15:05:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Both danish and faroese keyboard layouts uses Alt Gr-´ to print the pipe character \"|\" but the key binding resolver registers Alt Gr-´ as \"ctrl-alt-[\"\n\nI tried adding the following rule to keymap.cson:\n\n```\n'.workspace .editor:not(.mini)':\n  'ctrl-alt-[': 'native!'\n```\n\nBut this causes atom to both fold the current line and print |.
