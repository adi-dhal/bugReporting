Set the language to any that has a rule that features both of the following. `language-gfm` and `language-javascript` both fulfill this requirement in their grammars.\r\n  - A `begin` and `end` capture\r\n  - A `pattern` that delegates to another language that also has a rule containing both a `begin` and `end` capture. (It doesn't have to delegate, though.)\r\n\r\n2. Create something that matches that rule. For GFM, a code block tagged with `css` would suffice, and for JS, a tagged template starting with `html` would work.\r\n\r\n3. Within that block, type something that would match the `begin` half of any rule in the other language that includes both a `begin` and `end`. Do not include the end. For GFM or JS, just start a comment in CSS or HTML, respectively.\r\n\r\n4. Observe very odd syntax highlighting. It looks like a bug because it can't be contained, and repros 100% of the time.\r\n\r\nIf you followed the above repro, the code might look like this pre-syntax highlighting:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>GFM -> CSS\r\n<pre><code>```css<br>\r\n/* This is an unterminated comment<br>\r\n```<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome more text...\r\n</code></pre>\r\n<li><p>JS -> HTML\r\n<pre><code>html`<br>\r\n&lt;!-- This is an unterminated comment<br>\r\n`;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nsomeOtherCall();\r\n</code></pre>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nHere's a few screenshots of other code.\r\n\r\n`language-gfm` -> `language-javascript`:\r\n\r\n![screenshot from 2016-10-24 23-47-59](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4483844/19672425/57f076e8-9a44-11e6-8776-4ebaf959af1b.png)\r\n\r\n`language-javascript`

Ubuntu GNOME 14.04 (although it's been repro'd in Windows by others)\r\nAtom: v1.12.5 (been going on for quite a while)\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nInitially reported in

You can implement your own one, but no package will use it. You can't modify every single package yourself to get corresponding experience. Every package in emacs implement their own quickfix window, so when I build my project or run grep, or search a tag, many different windows are open. many different buffers are created. But Vim got standard quickfix, preview window , jump list and provide corresponding API to plugins. Many plugins in vim work with them. Compilation and grepping and tag searching plugins will all display them result in quickfix window and other plugins will highlight my source code by analyzing the content in quickfix they are fully cooperative. But in emacs each one has their own implementation just like many fragments. I was tired from swithing buffers and windows and killing many outdated buffers. In vim I never feel it like a burden.\r\n\r\nNow I am using Atom as my main editor, I even write [a package](https://atom.io/packages/atom-shell-commands) for Atom which has more than 5000+ downloads. I found the same problem in both Emacs and Atom: Each packages are trying to implement their quickfix window, too many fragments. A lot of different quickfix/location list like panels from different packages occupy my screen space, I have to keep closing or folding newly open panels again and again, some of them are still buggy or have limitation (atom-message-panel).\r\n\r\nIf Atom can provide a standard quickfix window / location list / preview window , packages will work with them and get cooperative. Compilation result can be display in quickfix window in realtime, tag result can display in quickfix and so does grep result, linting result. Some packages analyse data from it. And most important thing is people can get corresponding experience from different packages in Atom.\r\n\r\nOr at least, have a tab manager in the bottom panel, each package can use a tab in the bottom panel. not pile up. We can open a quickfix window and a mini terminal and a manual help window in different tabs in the bottom panel at the same time. Now if I am using two packages which will both display a panel in the bottom of the window, my workspace is totally messed up.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13502/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13501","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13501/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13501/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13501/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13501","id":197526973,"number":13501,"title":"Zoom

When linking my package folder (which resides in my home dir in linux and is mounted on a SAMBA share in windows), the `.atom/dev/packages` hierarchy in the `atom` pane remains empty (also in developer mode).\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. in windows `cmd` I go to my mounted folder: `C:\\Users\\ggreif>pushd Z:\\ide-haskell-repl`\r\n\r\n2. I link it to `atom`:\r\n```\r\nZ:\\ide-haskell-repl>apm link --dev\r\nINFO: Could not find files for the given pattern(s).\r\nThe system cannot find the file specified.\r\nC:\\Users\\ggreif\\.atom\\dev\\packages\\ide-haskell-repl -> Z:\\ide-haskell-repl\r\n```\r\n3. I start in dev mode: `Z:\\ide-haskell-repl>atom -d`\r\n4. I open up the \"Settings\" pane and hit the `Open Config Folder` button\r\n5. I observe: the `dev/packages` hierarchy is empty.\r\n6. I confirm that the folder is indeed linked:\r\n```\r\nZ:\\ide-haskell-repl>popd\r\nC:\\Users\\ggreif>dir .atom\\dev\r\n Volume in drive C is System\r\n Volume Serial Number is XXXXXXX\r\n\r\n Directory of C:\\Users\\ggreif\\.atom\\dev\r\n\r\n30.11.2016  17:04    <DIR>          .\r\n30.11.2016  17:04    <DIR>          ..\r\n22.12.2016  14:15    <DIR>          packages\r\n               0 File(s)              0 bytes\r\n               3 Dir(s)  231.205.515.264 bytes free\r\n\r\nC:\\Users\\ggreif>dir .atom\\dev\\packages\r\n Volume in drive C is System\r\n Volume Serial Number is XXXXXXX\r\n\r\n Directory of C:\\Users\\ggreif\\.atom\\dev\\packages\r\n\r\n22.12.2016  14:15    <DIR>          .\r\n22.12.2016  14:15    <DIR>          ..\r\n22.12.2016  14:15    <JUNCTION>     ide-haskell-repl [Z:\\ide-haskell-repl]\r\n               0 File(s)              0 bytes\r\n               3 Dir(s)  231.205.515.264 bytes free\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** I'd expect that my linked package shows up under `dev/packages`\r\n**Actual behavior:** It doesn't\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Happens always I try it.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nOS: Windows 7 Professional\r\n\r\nZ:\\hyper-haskell>atom --version\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.12.7\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\nZ:\\hyper-haskell>apm --version\r\nINFO: Could not find files for the given pattern(s).\r\nThe system cannot find the file specified.\r\napm  1.12.9\r\nnpm  3.10.5\r\nnode 4.4.5\r\npython\r\ngit\r\nvisual studio\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13492/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13491","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13491/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13491/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13491/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13491","id":197152742,"number":13491,"title":"Replacing project folder from CLI in open atom editor window","user":{"login":"dimitrieh","id":429659,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/429659?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitrieh","html_url":"https://github.com/dimitrieh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitrieh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitrieh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitrieh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitrieh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitrieh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitrieh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitrieh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitrieh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitrieh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true},{"id":505038679,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-12-22T11:18:45Z","updated_at":"2016-12-23T03:06:34Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nopen a project folder within an already open atom editor window while automatically removing the existing project folder it had open with CLI\r\n\r\n`atom -a .` only adds the current project folder\r\n\r\nI want to replace it, something like:\r\n\r\n`atom -r .`\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

the \"Open with atom\" context menu shortcut, it can be a little frustrating when a new instance of atom has to start up just to see the contents of a file. True, i could drag the file into the current editor window, but usually i'm on another screen, or in a foreground explorer window somewhere... Seems to make sense that opening a new editor should happen via this context menu action (and should continue to be a user action from within atom or from the taskbar/application icon).\r\n\r\ni'm writing of the behavior as it is in Windows 8 (Atom 1.12.7). i'm not sure if this behavior is the same on other OS's. Also, the system settings for enabling the context menu should all be checked on:\r\n![open-with-atom-system-settings](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12688631/21417992/51a8597e-c7ec-11e6-9632-44c827b21635.gif)\r\n\r\n**Current Behavior (using the \"Open with atom\" context menu):**\r\n1. Open a file from one directory. Then open another file in a neighboring directory. Notice how the two tabs are within the same editor, but only the contents of the first directory make it into the tree-view:\r\n\r\n![open-with-atom-neighboring-files](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12688631/21417942/e09c3d86-c7eb-11e6-878e-923709b3128e.gif)\r\n\r\n2. Open a file or directory in atom. Then open another neighboring/parent/child/or even distant directory. Notice how the target is opened in a new instance of atom:\r\n\r\n![open-with-atom-neighboring-directories](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12688631/21418025/7dae893a-c7ec-11e6-88ae-3e447e6254a2.gif)\r\n\r\ni realize that this is probably trivial to implement. All that's required is \"-a\" being inserted into windows registry value for the atom cli interaction. i modified src/main-process/win-shell.coffee and tested a build... and it works.\r\n\r\n**Suggested Behavior (using the \"Open with atom\" context menu):**\r\n\r\n![open-with-atom-suggested-behavior](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12688631/21418055/ae712e6a-c7ec-11e6-947f-1285e0db9908.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13488/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13487","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13487/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13487/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13487/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13487","id":197091142,"number":13487,"title":"Template update","user":{"login":"lee-dohm","id":1038121,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1038121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm","html_url":"https://github.com/lee-dohm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-12-22T04:14:29Z","updated_at":"2016-12-22T05:32:30Z","closed_at":"2016-12-22T05:32:30Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/13487","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13487","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13487.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13487.patch"},"body":"* Update to use the latest issue and PR templates. \r\n* Update the contributing guide to reference the template files themselves","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13487/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13486","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13486/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13486/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13486/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13486","id":197074247,"number":13486,"title":"Limit line decoration update to visible row range","user":{"login":"nathansobo","id":1789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo","html_url":"https://github.com/nathansobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-12-22T01:32:24Z","updated_at":"2016-12-22T02:54:49Z","closed_at":"2016-12-22T02:54:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/13486","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13486","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13486.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13486.patch"},"body":"Previously, if we had selections exceeding the visible range we still add line decorations to the cache for every row in the selection, including rows that were off screen and not rendered.
