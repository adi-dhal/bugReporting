0.155 / Mac OS X 10.10.1\n\nI’ve encountered a problem that I am reasonably certain was caused by Atom, but which I cannot reproduce (and therefore I have no test case to submit). I know how unuseful such a bug report is, but thought you should be aware of the issue.\n\n99% of the time I am programming, and so am pretty much just using ASCII. However, everything is saved in UTF-8, as is usual nowadays and is Atom’s default. During the last couple of days I needed to update a bunch of strings/locales files (de, es, fr, it, ja, pt-BR, zh-Hans, and zh-Hant) and now see several garbled characters have been introduced into lines which previously were good and which I had not edited. (I can tell this from the SVN history, for example in a de file I edited, I can see the line I changed, but also in a line I did not edit I see a ö converted to �.) (The files in question had only been edited by me, only using Atom.)\n\nIf I do a Find in Project for � (not scientific, I’m sure, but I’m not sure what else I can do) and restrict it just to the locales directory, I see a lot of results from files that previously were good. I can’t find any way to copy-and-paste from the Find in Project results pane, so here is a screenshot:\n\n![screen shot 2014-12-10 at 17 05 09](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7255543/5393735/1d7b4a94-8135-11e4-8576-5c4b5502326f.png)\n\nConfusingly, some of those files are in fact fine. If I open them by clicking on the line in the Find in Project results pane I do not see the garbled character and the result then disappears from the results pane.\n\nThis only happens with seemingly random characters, not all. For example in one pt-BR file a ç became garbled but other instances of the same character did not. Similarly in a de file one ö became garbled but others did not.\n\nPlease let me know if there is anything I can do to help pinpoint the issue. Unfortunately I can’t attach the actual locale files as they are private.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4541","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4541/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4541/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4541/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4541","id":51677597,"number":4541,"title":"Uncaught

The Problem\n\nCurrently, language packages specify comment strings via the `editor.commentStart` and `editor.commentEnd` scoped config values. This requires us to use an awkward private method on config in [`language-mode.coffee`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/language-mode.coffee#L33) to retrieve the comment strings so that pairs match up. If we retrieve each comment string separately with `atom.config.get`, it's possible that we'll retrieve the start and end comment strings from different scopes if the more specific scope doesn't have both values.\n## The Solution\n\nSince language mode is private, we could continue to use the private method, but it violates Atom's spirit of extensibility to rely on a private method to perform an action as fundamental as retrieving paired comments strings in a scope.\n\nThe better solution is to add another link to the key path, using `editor.comment.start` and `editor.comment.end` as our key paths. Then we can call `atom.config.get(\"editor.comment\")` to get a single object containing one or both keys.\n## What should we do?\n\nThis is an API change because the settings in language packages will need to be changed. We could potentially do this change after the freeze and just leave things deprecated until 2.0, but I would rather get it in since it's not that big a change. I would rather not carry it as technical debt until 2.0. The following steps will be required:\n- Read from the new key path.\n- Shim the old values when loading packages and log a deprecation warning.\n- Modify our TextMate converter to use the new key paths for the start/end comment strings.\n- Change bundled language packages.\n\n/cc @atom/core\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4518/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4517","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4517/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4517/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4517/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4517","id":51592705,"number":4517,"title":"Windows releases late again.","user":{"login":"mark-hahn","id":811455,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/811455?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn","html_url":"https://github.com/mark-hahn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":62363277,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2014-12-10T18:23:17Z","updated_at":"2014-12-11T19:47:15Z","closed_at":"2014-12-11T19:47:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"On chocolately windows releases were late due to the approval process.
