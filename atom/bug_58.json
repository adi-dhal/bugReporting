argument to dialog.showSaveDialog() needs to be a BrowserWindow\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/dialog.md\r\nhttps://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/lib/browser/api/dialog.js\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\n* Filling out the template is required. Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.\r\n* All new code requires tests to ensure against regressions\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nThis should fix some regression introduced by commit https://github.com/atom/atom/commit/c6cae5b8fdfea982084b068a0b38a7c988c52f51 related to `showSaveDialog` causing things such \"Save As\", \"Save as HTML\" to not work properly (default filename \"Untitled\" and default path missing when it should be autofilled with more \"reasonable\" ones--e.g. original filename and path). \r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the erroneous usage in [`src/main-process/atom-window.coffee#L268`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/c6cae5b8fdfea982084b068a0b38a7c988c52f51/src/main-process/atom-window.coffee#L268) introduced in commit https://github.com/atom/atom/commit/c6cae5b8fdfea982084b068a0b38a7c988c52f51\r\n```coffeescript\r\ndialog.showSaveDialog(this, params)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, `this` refers to an instance of AtomWindow, when the function `dialog.showSaveDialog` requires the first argument to be a BrowserWindow [`electron/lib/browser/api/dialog.js#L24`](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/lib/browser/api/dialog.js#L24). \r\n\r\nSo I believe the fix is simply \r\n```coffeescript\r\ndialog.showSaveDialog(@browserWindow, params)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is consistent with with the function binding usage in [`src/main-process/atom-window.coffee#L86@c6cae5b`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/c6cae5b8fdfea982084b068a0b38a7c988c52f51/src/main-process/atom-window.coffee#L86) and with the **old** working function `showSaveDialog` in [`src/application-delegate.coffee#L158`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/ae9d949ee4e199d1884bed89083196fa375bbd34/src/application-delegate.coffee#L158)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nWe must be able to understand the design of your change from this description.

The Atom message board is the best place for getting support: https://discuss.atom.io\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThere are already lots of unsaved buffer loss related issues, mostly of files with no project folder. However, this data loss scenario can also happen to a file with a project folder, without unusual or unintended behaviors such as crashing Atom, opening multiple windows of Atom, etc. It can be reproduced by the following steps.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open Atom with project folder A and make some change. Be sure that the changes are not saved.\r\n2. Close Atom.\r\n3. Open Atom with project folder B.\r\n4. Add project folder A, and then remove project folder B.\r\n5. Close Atom.\r\n6. Open Atom with project folder A. (Or possibly with no project folder)\r\n7. Now the changes are gone!\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** The changes must be preserved at a certain step. If Atom handles unsaved buffers separate from project folders, the changes should be shown in step 3. This was what I expected (as Sublime Text does) before I search for the related issues and find out that Atom integrates the editor's state with project folders. Since Atom integrates them, the changes in step 1 may be expected reappear in either step 4 (when adding project folder A) or step 6.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Data loss\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Always\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nYou can get this information from copy and pasting the output of `atom --version` and `apm --version` from the command line. Also, please include the OS and what version of the OS you're running.\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.15.0  \r\nElectron: 1.3.13  \r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82  \r\nNode    : 6.5.0  \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14112","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14112/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14112/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14112/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14112","id":218715119,"number":14112,"title":"Atom menu bar sometimes disappear","user":{"login":"AnthonyWC","id":6215805,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6215805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyWC","html_url":"https://github.com/AnthonyWC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyWC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyWC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyWC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyWC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyWC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyWC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyWC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyWC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnthonyWC/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193717188,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/blocked","name":"blocked","color":"d4c5f9","default":false},{"id":258255692,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/electron","name":"electron","color":"A5ECFA","default":false},{"id":97577987,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/linux","name":"linux","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2017-04-01T18:48:13Z","updated_at":"2017-08-22T01:16:52Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\r\n\r\nAtom menu bar sometimes disappear;

For that, we've made the `createItemForURI()` method public ðŸ˜Š\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nWe also considered adding a new option (`addItem`). Ultimately, this approach was chosen instead because `createItemForURI()` avoids the extra searching machinery of `open()` which probably isn't desired when creating an item.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nNow we can open items without focusing their tab.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nThis is a breaking change so callers using `activateItem: false` may have to be updated. This seems to be exceedingly rare though.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14106","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14106/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14106/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14106/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14106","id":218596937,"number":14106,"title":"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'paths' of undefined (while reopening a project)","user":{"login":"AmauryCarrade","id":1417570,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1417570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmauryCarrade","html_url":"https://github.com/AmauryCarrade","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmauryCarrade/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmauryCarrade/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmauryCarrade/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmauryCarrade/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmauryCarrade/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmauryCarrade/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmauryCarrade/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmauryCarrade/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmauryCarrade/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-03-31T19:35:31Z","updated_at":"2017-03-31T20:37:42Z","closed_at":"2017-03-31T20:19:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Steps:\r\n1.

Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.\r\n* All new code requires tests to ensure against regressions\r\n\r\nPlease advise on a test I can write. I have not been able to successfully compile HEAD so I'm not sure if I can test or if this code is complete. It is a small patch so feel free to just fork it. Note that I did manually test the concept by using the --socket-path option on startup and writing the socket path in the same way that it would be constructed in this code.\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nAtom connects to a socket to determine if it is already running\r\nand if it should launch a new window in the same process.\r\nThis socket is named with the user's name but ignores the user's\r\ndisplay. If a user has multiple displays, such as running a\r\nremote display server, Atom will pop up the new window on the display\r\nthat it was first started on.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds the display name to the socket name if it exists\r\nin the env. Because a separate socket is being opened Atom does\r\nthe correct thing and launches on the display it was started on.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nNo alternatives. On linux it should be using D-Bus to avoid these lifecycle/session issues but this is good enough with the benefit that it will work across different Unix like envs.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nAtom windows should open up on the display they are started on.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nUsers who remote into a different display (such as I have to do for work) will be able to start Atom without first stopping Atom processes running on a different display.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nNone. This is proper behavior. Applications should always respect the environment they are started in.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14092","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14092/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14092/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14092/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14092","id":218004589,"number":14092,"title":"BrowserWindow events won't fire after reload","user":{"login":"juschu","id":2906940,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2906940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juschu","html_url":"https://github.com/juschu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juschu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juschu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juschu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juschu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juschu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juschu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juschu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juschu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juschu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118249520,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/api","name":"api","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-03-29T20:48:34Z","updated_at":"2017-03-30T17:35:02Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\r\n\r\nIn my init script I registered listerners to the \"enter-full-screen\" and \"leave-full-screen\" events on the [BrowserWindow](https://electron.atom.io/docs/api/browser-window/) object you get from atom::getCurrentWindow.\r\nOn the first start everything works as exspected but when I reload the window it doesn't work anymore. I also tried it with the events \"maximize\" and \"focus\". Same problem.\r\nThe rest of my init script still works after a reload.\r\nI tried to reproduce it in safe mode. It looks like the init script isn't executed in safe mode, so I registered the listeners in the developer console. At first they worked but when I reload the window and it's the same problem again.\r\n`atom --safe`, `atom --clear-window-state` and starting with a fresh user profile didn't help either.\r\nThere arn't any error messages in the developer console.\r\nSince BrowserWindow is an Electron class I'm not sure if this is an Atom or Electron problem, but you're the same developer team anyway, right?\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Put this in your init script\r\n    CoffeeScript\r\n    ```coffee\r\n    atom.getCurrentWindow().on \"enter-full-screen\", () ->\r\n        alert \"It works!\"\r\n    ```\r\n    or JavaScript\r\n    ```javascript\r\n    atom.getCurrentWindow().on(\"enter-full-screen\", function(){\r\n        alert(\"It works!\");\r\n    });\r\n    ```\r\n2. Restart Atom to check if it works on the first start by going fullscreen (F11). Instead of using the init script and restarting you could also paste the JavaScript version into the developer console.\r\n3. Reload with the command window:reload (Ctrl+Shift+F5). If you pasted the JavaScript version into the developer console do it again.
