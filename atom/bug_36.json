This can be used to back off of work, for example.\r\n\r\nAfter talking to @nathansobo and @maxbrunsfeld, we decided the best way forward was to be able to use IntersectionObserver for this…but there are some issues.\r\n\r\nThe first is that—in its current iteration, at least—it doesn't seem to observe when visibility changes as a result of being masked by an `overflow: hidden` parent, which is how docks do it. (See [pen][1].)\r\n\r\nTo work around this, I put together this commit which toggles the `display` of the wrapper element when the dock is shown and completely masked. This guarantees that the IntersectionObserver will broadcast notifications at the appropriate time. However, this too has an issue: the `intersectionRatio` property (which I'd assume people would use to determine if the element was visible) is `0` at the beginning of the show animation. This kinda makes sense because, well, yeah, it isn't actually shown at all yet at the point when the animation to show it starts. I'm assuming that this is why the [`isIntersecting`][2] property was added (but I'm a n00b wrt the API so maybe not). After some playing around, though, I discovered that there was a way to distinguish between the visible and hidden states as, in the case of the item being shown, the `width + height` was nonzero.\r\n\r\nSo I wrote up some tests to verify the behavior and they pass…\r\n\r\nbut then I ran my tests without my dock changes and they still pass. That would seem to imply that the `overflow: hidden` masking _is_ actually triggering an IntersectionObserver notification?? 😖 (It doesn't if you observe the tree view and toggle the dock.)\r\n\r\n@nathansobo @as-cii Any guidance you could give about this inconsistent IntersectionObserver behavior would be super appreciated.\r\n\r\n[1]:

https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nLet's say I have a git repo with a single file, `a.txt`, on `master`.  The `add-b-file` branch adds a new `b.txt` file to the repo.  When on `add-b-file` with both `a.txt` and `b.txt` open in Atom, switching branches to `master` does not close `b.txt` even if there are no unsaved changes.  I have \"Close Deleted File Tabs\" checked.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a git repo and commit a file\r\n2. Switch to a new branch and add a different file\r\n3. Open both files in Atom\r\n4. Switch back to the original branch\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Only `a.txt` to exist in Atom\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Both files are still open, with `b.txt` marked as having unsaved changes.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.19.0-dev-c6bf86c9b\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThis looks like a regression from #693.  The steps to reproduce I gave are what I believe to be a simplified version of what I'm experiencing.  If they don't actually work, the actual scenario I'm facing has to do with switching between the `wl-split-grammars` and `master` branch on atom/language-php.\r\n\r\nTentatively /cc'ing @iolsen because of atom/tabs#306.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14764","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14764/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14764/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14764/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14764","id":235357258,"number":14764,"title":"Nested git repo is ignored by fuzzy finder when \"Exclude VCS Ignored Paths\" checked","user":{"login":"kuzi117","id":676209,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/676209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuzi117","html_url":"https://github.com/kuzi117","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuzi117/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuzi117/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuzi117/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuzi117/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuzi117/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuzi117/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuzi117/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuzi117/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuzi117/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-06-12T20:35:01Z","updated_at":"2017-06-13T21:02:10Z","closed_at":"2017-06-13T17:24:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode\r\n* Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide\r\n* Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions\r\n* Checked that the issue isn't already filed (This was actually posted as a comment in #14439)\r\n* Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThere is a series of problem with focus on the bottom dock.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Install a package that belongs to the bottom dock (to explain all the different problems I'll use [atom-terminal-tab](https://atom.io/packages/atom-terminal-tab) and [linter-ui-default](https://atom.io/packages/linter-ui-default))\r\n2. Manually open the bottom dog with the Up arrow displayed on hover\r\n3. Type some text. **First issue:** The editor still has focus, I would expect the dock to have focus since I manually opened it.\r\n4. Click the dock to give it focus. Now you can type in the dock\r\n5. Now try to switch to the Linter dock. **Second issue:** The docks closes automatically giving focus back to the editor (Note in order to replicate this issue there should be no linter errors and `Hide Panel When Empty` should be enabled in linter-ui-default configuration)\r\n\r\nI experienced more issues before that I can no longer replicate, like for example clicking inside the dock gave focus to the dock but it also closed it, so when you typed the text went to the dock but you couldn't see it. This has been fixed since (maybe in Atom 1.18 beta 3 or in the Terminal package)\r\n\r\nThe second issue probably belongs to @steelbrain /linter-ui-default so I would like to focus on the first issue since that is a problem with Atom itself.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n![atom-bottom-dock-focus-issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1095969/27061083-ae6ce58c-4fb7-11e7-8e87-bda9f16f17a9.gif)\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:**\r\nAlways\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nI'm running on Atom 1.18 beta 3 (Windows 10 x64) but have replicated back to Atom 1.17 beta 0 when docks were first introduced.\r\n\r\n### Additional

Description of the Change\r\n\r\nWhile attempting to interact with an Express.js server within some Atom tests, we ran into the following error related to Atom's current Content Security Policy:\r\n\r\n```\r\nEvalError: Refused to evaluate a string as JavaScript because 'unsafe-eval' is not an allowed source of script in the following Content Security Policy directive: \"script-src 'self'\".\r\n\r\n  at Function.wrapfunction [as function] (node_modules/depd/index.js:409:43)\r\n  at populateConstructorExports (node_modules/http-errors/index.js:247:45)\r\n  at Object.<anonymous> (node_modules/http-errors/index.js:29:1)\r\n  at Object.<anonymous> (node_modules/http-errors/index.js:262:3)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the policy to resolve this error ☝️, allowing Atom to run

stop using eval, but we are not aware of any advantages of making such a change upstream.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nAllow package authors to use libraries that rely on eval.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nWe're not aware of any negative consequences that this change would introduce, but it _is_ a change to the CSP, so we definitely want to hear from others. :pray:\r\n\r\n@atom/maintainers: Do you know of any negative consequences that would result from this change?\r\n\r\n### Applicable
