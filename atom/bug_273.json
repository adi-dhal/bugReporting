After setting syntax or file encoding from the menus in the status bar, the cursor focus stays in the status bar, and to move focus back to the file with keyboard only, you need to press Tab key twice (after setting syntax) or thrice (after setting encoding). Imho it would be better to move the cursor focus to its last position in the file window.\n2. Even though the focus is retained (coloured outline) after completing syntax/encoding change, there is no way to bring up these menus with Enter key (or other key combinations that I've tried).\n\nIf you decide to move cursor focus to file, the status bar menu outline should be removed.\n\nIf you decide to keep the focus in the status bar, the focus appearance could be improved in appearance. Currently it doesn't look bad, but it could at least use some padding on the sides of the focused item.\n![screen shot 2015-07-01 at 08 57 29](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/654500/8449160/3cdf8d94-1fcf-11e5-8d70-5850454550d6.png)\n\nLastly, setting syntax/encoding should be available from the Command Palette. Perhaps the same way as in Sublime Text (showing all entries prefixed appropriately) or just a way to trigger the selection menus as they exist now.\n\n(Atom 1.0 on OSX 10.10)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7615/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7614","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7614/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7614/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7614/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7614","id":92275429,"number":7614,"title":"Path doesn't update in title bar when current working directory changes","user":{"login":"funkytaco","id":1712205,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1712205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkytaco","html_url":"https://github.com/funkytaco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkytaco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkytaco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkytaco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkytaco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkytaco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkytaco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkytaco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkytaco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkytaco/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-07-01T05:39:51Z","updated_at":"2017-08-02T16:29:24Z","closed_at":"2017-08-02T16:29:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Tested on OS X Yosemite:\n\nThe path shown in Atom's title bar when current working directory changes.

#7563, I fixed an issue where alignment spaces were getting stripped when auto-indenting lines that combined tabs and spaces by only allowing one kind of character to count as indentation. There were concerns, however, that this would make Atom's indentation handling less robust in the face of sloppy code where tabs and spaces are interleaved.\n\nThis takes an approach more similar to @driskell's original PR (#5658), but we continue to use floating point numbers for the indent level. When hard tabs are enabled, we handle the fractional portion of the indent level by appending an appropriate number of trailing spaces.\n\n@driskell Any thoughts on this one?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7602/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7601","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7601/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7601/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7601/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7601","id":92178203,"number":7601,"title":"Strange
