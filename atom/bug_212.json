It also un-deprecates `TextEditor::getFirstVisibleScreenRow`, making it possible to synchronously read the editor's vertical scroll position.\n\nThis was driven out by vim-mode's [`ScrollFullPage` commands](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/blob/e1d1a3edbaa16b6010e688b07c6cb3b9cd5c95a9/lib/motions/general-motions.coffee#L454), which need to synchronously update the editor's scroll position.\n\nI've refactored the presenter so that it doesn't store its own copy of the `scrollRow` and `scrollColumn` state, using the model instead as the source of truth for these concepts. As part of this effort, I refactored the way the presenter's `scrollTop` and `scrollLeft` are initialized; they're now computed based on the `firstVisibleScreen{Row,Column}` as soon as the necessary measurements (line-height and base-character-width) are assigned.\n\nRefs https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/pull/906\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9444/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9443","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9443/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9443/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9443/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9443","id":115176529,"number":9443,"title":"Add portable mode for Mac","user":{"login":"raelyard","id":879480,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/879480?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raelyard","html_url":"https://github.com/raelyard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raelyard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raelyard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raelyard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raelyard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raelyard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raelyard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raelyard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raelyard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raelyard/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722948,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-review","name":"needs-review","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-11-04T23:48:49Z","updated_at":"2017-01-10T20:24:47Z","closed_at":"2017-01-10T20:24:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/9443","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9443","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9443.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9443.patch"},"body":"Similar to portable mode for Windows and Linux, but the relative path for the portable .atom home directory has a deeper nesting.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9443/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9442","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9442/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9442/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9442/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9442","id":115169149,"number":9442,"title":"file reformatting on open","user":{"login":"chrisdrackett","id":4378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrackett","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdrackett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrackett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrackett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrackett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrackett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrackett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrackett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrackett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrackett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrackett/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-11-04T23:00:24Z","updated_at":"2015-11-04T23:12:49Z","closed_at":"2015-11-04T23:07:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have files with a `.examples` extension that recently started to reformat on open.

It crashes not because I'm copying files but somehow my OS detects it sa a file upload and blocks the action immediately. If there's a usage data upload back to Atom how can we turn this off ? In blocked environments I'm not allowed to report usage neither do uploads.\n\nThanks.\n![upload_not_permitted](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5233805/10937905/5ccddcd4-82dd-11e5-80f9-01d3e5017bb9.png)\n![atom_crashing](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5233805/10937906/5ce5a026-82dd-11e5-93bf-445820535192.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9432/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9431","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9431/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9431/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9431/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9431","id":115039794,"number":9431,"title":"Crashing when opening file inside large repository.","user":{"login":"David-Polehonski","id":2487640,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2487640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/David-Polehonski","html_url":"https://github.com/David-Polehonski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/David-Polehonski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/David-Polehonski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/David-Polehonski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/David-Polehonski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/David-Polehonski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/David-Polehonski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/David-Polehonski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/David-Polehonski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/David-Polehonski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-11-04T12:12:33Z","updated_at":"2015-11-05T01:56:20Z","closed_at":"2015-11-05T01:56:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have a large repo (7.5Gb) and atom crashes every time I attempt to open any file in the project.
