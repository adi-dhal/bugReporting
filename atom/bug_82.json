setting when overriding `nonWordCharacters` in a scope-specific setting since `nonWordCharacters` is a single string.  That means it's an all-or-nothing change, rather than being able to add or remove characters as necessary.\r\n\r\nFor example, $ is a valid identifier for many languages. However the default `nonWordCharacters` includes `$`, which means attempting to double-click to select a variable with `$` in it will only select part of it. The best way to fix this currently is to override `nonWordCharacters` in the language settings by copying/pasting the default value and removing the `$`. However, this totally disregards any customizations the user may have made.\r\n\r\n**Possible solutions**:\r\n* The best one I could think of is adding some type of new setting that takes scenarios like these into account.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nN/A - this is an API limitation.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.14.0-dev-d3d06fb\r\nElectron: 1.4.7\r\nChrome  : 53.0.2785.143\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n```\r\non Windows 10 x64.\r\n\r\n/cc @nathansobo","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13391/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13390","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13390/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13390/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13390/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13390","id":193621212,"number":13390,"title":"Remembering Removed Project Folder(s)","user":{"login":"Utilityman","id":8432007,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8432007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utilityman","html_url":"https://github.com/Utilityman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utilityman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utilityman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utilityman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utilityman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utilityman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utilityman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utilityman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utilityman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Utilityman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-12-05T21:55:56Z","updated_at":"2017-01-06T05:23:01Z","closed_at":"2016-12-05T22:16:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\r\nDiscovered on a Mac!\r\n\r\nUser view: If you remove a project folder from atom, the next time you close and reopen Atom the project returns.  \r\n\r\nUnder the hood: You can see what's going on in the ~/.atom/storage/application.json file. When you remove a project, the initial path is not removed from the file. So on reboot it comes back as if it were never removed at all. \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce (for mac)\r\n\r\n1. Right Click Project -> Remove Project Folder\r\n2. Command-Q to quit atom\r\n3. Reboot to find the return of the project.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** \r\nI would expect that when you remove a project folder that it stays removed and does not come back on a separate session. Projects that are added should be added and those that are removed should be removed. \r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** \r\nThe removed projects persist between sessions. It seems that 'Remove Project Folder' just graphically removes it. \r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.12.6\r\nElectron: 1.3.9\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\nRunning On Mac \r\nOS X El Capitan Version 10.11.6\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13390/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13389","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13389/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13389/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13389/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13389","id":193595636,"number":13389,"title":"Proper usage of script/build for a user-level install?","user":{"login":"CodeMan99","id":6373201,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6373201?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeMan99","html_url":"https://github.com/CodeMan99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeMan99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeMan99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeMan99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeMan99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeMan99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeMan99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeMan99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeMan99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeMan99/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-12-05T20:00:29Z","updated_at":"2016-12-05T20:56:49Z","closed_at":"2016-12-05T20:56:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Building from source was not a problem for me up to (and including) **v1.10.2**.\r\n\r\nSince then I have been met with multiple problems and errors while trying to build.

It does not matter if it spans a single line or multiple lines.\r\n2) The literal contains an SQL keyword in single quotes.\r\n3) The keyword is uppercase.\r\n4) Not all SQL keywords trigger the bug. SELECT and UPDATE do, INSERT do not.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open a new tab, switch language to Python\r\n2. Enter following code:\r\n```python\r\n\"\"\"'SELECT'\"\"\"\r\npass\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nSecond line should be colored as code.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\nSecond line is colored as part of string literal.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nOS: Linux Mint 18\r\n\r\nAtom:\r\nAtom    : 1.12.6\r\nElectron: 1.3.9\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\nAPM:\r\napm  1.12.9\r\nnpm  3.10.5\r\nnode 4.4.5\r\npython 2.7.12\r\ngit 2.11.0","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13387/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13386","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13386/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13386/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13386/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13386","id":193510633,"number":13386,"title":"Replace `libXScrnSaver` with `libXss.so.1` in RPM package spec","user":{"login":"as-cii","id":482957,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/482957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii","html_url":"https://github.com/as-cii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2016-12-05T14:25:54Z","updated_at":"2017-05-09T14:19:58Z","closed_at":"2016-12-07T10:29:53Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/13386","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13386","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13386.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13386.patch"},"body":"Closes #13354 \r\n\r\nThis pull request fixes a regression introduced in #13289 that prevented Atom from installing on openSUSE because of a missing dependency.

But depending on the usage, it may become too much multipurpose as adding more and more plugins to support many usages quickly makes it a bloatware.\r\n\r\nFor a concrete example, I'm using Atom as a text editor, a markdown editor, a C/C++ IDE, and sometimes as a C# IDE or a Python IDE. I end up with lots of specific usage plugins which increase startup time and resource usage for nothing: clang-autocomplete and clang-linter are useless in C#, and OmniSharp is useless in C/C++, even worst, both are not needed when I want to quickly edit a text file, and waiting several seconds to edit a text file is quite boring.\r\n\r\nThere are some workarounds, like enabling plugins per project, but loading plugins only when needed would be easier, more flexible and sometimes the only alternative (when using Atom as a simple text editor with language plugins for example).\r\n\r\n## Typical usages\r\n\r\n* IDE / advanced text editor: This is mostly the typical usage. It uses plugins providing autocompletion, linting and some other language-specific features (markdown-preview for example). It also uses CVS, but not always.\r\n* Simple text editor: I know that there are editors more suited for this, but why having multiple text editors for multiple usages when we have a modular one? And, why not, maybe a fool in the future will even make an office suite plugin to replace LibreOffice...\r\n\r\n## Some brainstorming\r\n\r\nPlugins would be separated in two types :\r\n* always-enabled plugins, which are (almost?) always usefull / wanted like the project-manager plugin. These would be always loaded on start.\r\n* usage-specific plugins, which are usefull only on some condition, like language linters. These would be loaded only when the conditions are met.\r\n* dependency-only plugin, which are useless on themselves, like the linter plugin. These would be loaded only when another plugin need them.\r\n\r\nTo let plugin writers handle this change slightly, plugins not reporting their type would be considered as always-enabled plugins.\r\n\r\nConditions would include, but not be extaustive to :\r\n* the open file(s) / project(s) language(s) : Some plugins would be explicitely related to some language(s). For quick opening of Atom, language plugins would be loaded on file open. To avoid often loads and unloads, a plugin would be unloaded only when there is no file of this language in the project anymore.\r\n* the presence of a file / directory in the project : Obviously, I don't need git-status if I have no `.git` folder in my project. The same goes for the build plugin with the .atom-build file.\r\n\r\nAs some plugins need some dependencies but may not always report them correctly (especially for those which depend on default plugins), I suggest a \"force always-loaded\" setting to let time to reflect the change to plugin writers.\r\n\r\n## The word of the end\r\n\r\nI'm not an Atom developper, and I know that this is a very big work and that it likely needs code refactoring. The behavior like the implementation details need to be carefully thought to avoid making plugin management a big mess. I don't expect to see it anytime soon, but it would make Atom the perfect text editor / IDE (at least for me).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13380/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13379","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13379/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13379/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13379/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13379","id":193293886,"number":13379,"title":"Custom build with modified atom.sh doesn't work?","user":{"login":"jaredreich","id":8563847,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8563847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaredreich","html_url":"https://github.com/jaredreich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaredreich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaredreich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaredreich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaredreich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaredreich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaredreich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaredreich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaredreich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaredreich/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":175213356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/question","name":"question","color":"ededed","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-12-03T15:31:24Z","updated_at":"2016-12-05T10:46:24Z","closed_at":"2016-12-05T10:46:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I tried doing a custom build by cloning and then modifying atom.sh, changing the application name to \"Atom2.app\" and the settings folder to \".atom2\", but none of the atom.sh settings persisted.

In particular, when installing or disabling/enabling a package that relied on the `core:loaded-shell-environment` hook, such package would never activate because the hook had already been triggered.\r\n\r\nThis problem was not specific to `core:loaded-shell-environment`: in facts, the `grammar-used` hook was affected by it as well, although it was less evident because a `grammar-used` hook is emitted every time a new file is opened, rather than just once as it happens for `core:loaded-shell-environment`.\r\n\r\nWith this pull request, when a package is activated (either after installing it or after re-enabling it) we will re-trigger all the activation hooks that have been triggered until that moment. In addition, after a package has been successfully activated, we will stop listening to further activation (hooks and commands) events for that specific package.\r\n\r\n/cc: @atom/maintainers @joefitzgerald ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13372/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13371","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13371/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13371/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13371/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13371","id":193091591,"number":13371,"title":"Active tab not showing in tabs","user":{"login":"pptyasar","id":21305090,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/21305090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pptyasar","html_url":"https://github.com/pptyasar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pptyasar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pptyasar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pptyasar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pptyasar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pptyasar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pptyasar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pptyasar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pptyasar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pptyasar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722939,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"e6e6e6","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-12-02T11:12:36Z","updated_at":"2016-12-02T11:56:43Z","closed_at":"2016-12-02T11:56:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When there is too many tabs in atom.
