And I believe Math.min was a mistake. Original intent probably was to use Math.max instead.\nIt didn't guard against case of generating invalid width if screen.getPrimaryDisplay().workAreaSize returned 0 or some negative value.\nAnd it was clamping width for displays wider than 1024 which makes little sense.\n\nNew implementation makes sure width is at least 1024 and height is at least 512 after reset.\n\nFixes #7555\nFixes
