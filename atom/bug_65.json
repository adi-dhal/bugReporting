Currently, the Atom specs run using v1.3.1, while Jasmine v2.5.2 is already out and a lot of useful functionality has been added.\r\n\r\nFor example, I recently added a new property to some object, see [this PR](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13812), which caused a regression test to fail (as expected). You can see how I fixed this test suite in [this](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13812/commits/cacfcc75e336e78e9dbd88dc0ac717c177a8a418) commit, but with a newer version of Jasmine it would have been possible to write the following, which is much easier to read.\r\n```javascript\r\nexpect(events).toEqual [\r\n\t['will', {item: item1, pane: pane1, prevent: jasmine.any(Function), index: 0}]\r\n\t['did', {item: item1, pane: pane1, index: 0}]\r\n\t['will', {item: item3, pane: pane2, prevent: jasmine.any(Function), index: 1}]\r\n\t['did', {item: item3, pane: pane2, index: 1}]\r\n\t['will', {item: item2, pane: pane2, prevent: jasmine.any(Function), index: 0}]\r\n\t['did', {item: item2, pane: pane2, index: 0}]\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI already looked into replacing `./vendor/jasmine.js` myself, but simply replacing it with the latest version of Jasmine (and adding the tweaks described in the current version of the file) doesn't seem to work as it causes a lot of tests to fail.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nOn a similar note (and I think updating Jasmine will help with this), the error messages I got from Jasmine on my failing tests where rather unhelpful... In AppVeyor I got [this](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Atom/atom/build/5128/job/om5pm2vd3sexu56m#L396), in circleci I got [this](https://circleci.com/gh/atom/atom/2620?utm_campaign=vcs-integration-link&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github-build-link) and locally the stacktrace was:\r\n```\r\nPaneContainer\r\n  ::onWillDestroyPaneItem() and ::onDidDestroyPaneItem\r\n    it invokes the given callbacks when an item will be destroyed on any pane\r\n      TypeError: undefined is not a function\r\n        at jasmine.StringPrettyPrinter.emitObject (file:///D:/temp/atom/out/app/spec/spec-helper.coffee:158:16)\r\n        at jasmine.StringPrettyPrinter.emitObject (file:///D:/temp/atom/out/app/spec/spec-helper.coffee:158:16)\r\n        at jasmine.StringPrettyPrinter.emitObject (file:///D:/temp/atom/out/app/spec/spec-helper.coffee:158:16)\r\n        at jasmine.StringPrettyPrinter.emitObject (file:///D:/temp/atom/out/app/spec/spec-helper.coffee:158:16)\r\n        at jasmine.StringPrettyPrinter.emitObject (file:///D:/temp/atom/out/app/spec/spec-helper.coffee:158:16)\r\n        at jasmine.StringPrettyPrinter.emitObject (file:///D:/temp/atom/out/app/spec/spec-helper.coffee:158:16)\r\n        at jasmine.StringPrettyPrinter.emitObject (file:///D:/temp/atom/out/app/spec/spec-helper.coffee:158:16)\r\n        at jasmine.StringPrettyPrinter.emitObject (file:///D:/temp/atom/out/app/spec/spec-helper.coffee:158:16)\r\n        at jasmine.StringPrettyPrinter.emitObject (file:///D:/temp/atom/out/app/spec/spec-helper.coffee:158:16)\r\n        at jasmine.StringPrettyPrinter.emitObject (file:///D:/temp/atom/out/app/spec/spec-helper.coffee:158:16)\r\n        at jasmine.StringPrettyPrinter.emitObject (file:///D:/temp/atom/out/app/spec/spec-helper.coffee:158:16)\r\n        at jasmine.StringPrettyPrinter.emitObject (file:///D:/temp/atom/out/app/spec/spec-helper.coffee:158:16)\r\n        at .<anonymous> (file:///D:/Workspace/atom/spec/pane-container-spec.coffee:304:22)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the AppVeyor stacktrace we can see that the problem has to do with some instance of `obj.hasOwnProperty` in a PrettyPrinter function. After searching for an instance of `obj.hasOwnProperty`\r\n(which I could find in `out/app/spec/spec-helper.coffee`) I found one in `./vendor/jasmine.js` in its PrettyPrinter function (line 1934), but thats all I could figure out about it...\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether updating Jasmine will fix this but I certainly think it won't hurt.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13899/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13898","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13898/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13898/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13898/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13898","id":210874600,"number":13898,"title":"Use new maxLineLength parameter to GrammarRegistry","user":{"login":"maxbrunsfeld","id":326587,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/326587?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld","html_url":"https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-02-28T18:53:56Z","updated_at":"2017-03-02T01:00:02Z","closed_at":"2017-03-02T00:59:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/13898","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13898","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13898.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13898.patch"},"body":"Refs https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/1667#issuecomment-280896197","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13898/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13897","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13897/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13897/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13897/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13897","id":210857187,"number":13897,"title":"Use shared system buffer on CMD+E","user":{"login":"elado","id":51488,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/51488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elado","html_url":"https://github.com/elado","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elado/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elado/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elado/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elado/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elado/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elado/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elado/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elado/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elado/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-02-28T17:34:56Z","updated_at":"2017-02-28T18:49:53Z","closed_at":"2017-02-28T18:48:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"In most native apps on mac, CMD+E puts the selected text in a special buffer which is shared between all apps.

https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI recently noticed that Atom freezes and becomes unresponsive whenever I open a large file with say, more than 300 lines, or any kind of minified JS file. I'm running `v1.14.3` on `OS 10.11.6`. I can reproduce the issue consistently even in safe mode.\r\n\r\nI've tried disabling all of my added packages and reverting to the stock themes, but that made no difference.\r\n\r\nWhen opening a large non-minified file, Atom seems to recover from the freeze in a few seconds but continued running sluggishly. When opening any minified file, Atom freezes and I am forced to force quit the process.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open Atom\r\n2. Open a large file with more than 300 lines of code OR:\r\n3. Open any minified JS file\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Should open the file and continue to be responsive.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Freezes and usually must be force quit\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Reproducible 100% of the time\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nOS X : 10.11.6 (Mid 2009 13\" MacBook Pro / 2.26GHz Core 2 Duo 8GB RAM / 256GB SSD)\r\nAtom    : 1.14.3\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nSee attachment for latest crash report.\r\n[Atom_2017-02-27-155309_GALACTICA.txt](https://github.com/atom/atom/files/805165/Atom_2017-02-27-155309_GALACTICA.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunity Packages Installed:\r\n1. autoclose-html v0.23.0\r\n2. color-picker v2.2.5\r\n3. file-icons v2.0.16\r\n4. fold-functions v0.5.0\r\n\r\nCommunity Themes Installed:\r\n1. seti-ui v1.6.1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13889/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13888","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13888/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13888/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13888/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13888","id":210548967,"number":13888,"title":"Atom Is Really Slow At Refocusing.","user":{"login":"RekkyRek","id":16632409,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/16632409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RekkyRek","html_url":"https://github.com/RekkyRek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RekkyRek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RekkyRek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RekkyRek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RekkyRek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RekkyRek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RekkyRek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RekkyRek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RekkyRek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RekkyRek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-02-27T17:16:34Z","updated_at":"2017-02-27T18:08:19Z","closed_at":"2017-02-27T18:08:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When refocusing atom it takes about 1 -

This means that (1) there's not consistent UI for toggling panels and (2) users don't have any control over the placement of their tools. In Nuclide, we've tackled this with a feature called “workspace views.” It has two main goals:\r\n\r\n* Provide a way for package authors to make location-agnostic views.\r\n* Provide containers for displaying these views.\r\n\r\nWe'd like to get this functionality into Atom core 😊\r\n\r\n![wspv3b](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/126263/23325856/6786fd74-faad-11e6-926c-3b51838c3949.gif)\r\n\r\nNuclide's workspace views package is based on a lot of the abstractions and concepts already in Atom:\r\n\r\n* It exposes an `addOpener()` API for registering model factories.\r\n* It exposes an `open()` function for showing them.\r\n* It creates three panels (left, right, and bottom), each with its own PaneContainer and tab bar.\r\n\r\nThis allows interop with the workspace pane container (i.e. users can move things into the main workspace when they want it to appear larger) and lends itself to adoption into Atom by extending existing APIs.\r\n\r\n# Proposal\r\n\r\nWe propose extending the existing `atom.workspace.open()` API to support multiple “locations,” including each of the panels. `addOpener()` shouldn't require any changes, but there are some workspace-level which would be helpful to add:\r\n\r\n### `destroyItemWhere(predicate: (item: Object) => boolean): void`\r\n\r\nPackage authors can use this to destroy all of the views they've created when their package is deactivated.\r\n\r\n### `toggle(uri: string, options?: Object): void`\r\n\r\nAllows toggling visibility of specific items. If a matching item is already visible in a panel, that panel gets hidden.\r\n\r\nSo far, we haven't had a reason to require inspection of the panels, so we don't have any analogues to `getPanes()`, etc. but it probably makes sense for hackability.\r\n\r\n## Model Additions\r\n\r\nAs far as the view model goes, we followed the precedent set by `getTitle()`, `getIconName()`, et. al. and added a few optional methods:\r\n\r\n### `getDefaultLocation?: () => string`\r\n\r\nWith Nuclide's workspace views, users decide where to place their views (as opposed to package authors specifying a location when they call `open()`). If they move the file tree to the right panel, that location will get serialized and used the next time they open the file tree. This method gives package authors to specify the default location. Allowed locations are “left-panel”, “right-panel”, “bottom-panel”, and “pane” (which corresponds to the workspace's pane container). Nuclide also has an API for registering custom locations, but we probably don't need to support this in Atom at this point.\r\n\r\n### ``getPreferredInitialWidth?: () => number``\r\n\r\n### `getPreferredInitialHeight?: () => number`\r\n\r\nThe size of panels is controlled by users and serialized, but these two methods provide a way for package authors to provide an initial size when a panel is first shown.\r\n\r\n### `didChangeVisibility?: (visible: boolean) => void`\r\n\r\nThis one's kinda orthogonal, but really useful. It allows models to be notified when they're being displayed so that they can make optimizations.\r\n\r\n# Open Questions\r\n\r\nThere are a few open questions we'll need to figure out:\r\n\r\n* What methods should be added to inspect locations and their contents?\r\n* What theme compatibility concerns are there?\r\n    * We only really support the big four (Atom & One Light/Dark)\r\n* How should we deal with tabs?\r\n    * We've vendored parts of [atom/tabs](https://github.com/atom/tabs) and create them ourselves. Should that package be updated to decorate these new panels instead?\r\n* What language?\r\n    * Is the doc situation solved for mixed CS/JS repos?\r\n* What dependencies can we bring along?\r\n    * Our current implementation uses both React and RxJS\r\n\r\nLet the discussion begin! 😊\r\n\r\ncc @nathansobo @maxbrunsfeld @joefitzgerald @BinaryMuse","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13878/reactions","total_count":15,"+1":11,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":4}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13877","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13877/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13877/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13877/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13877","id":210119817,"number":13877,"title":"Replace language-python with MagicPython","user":{"login":"1st1","id":239003,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/239003?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1st1","html_url":"https://github.com/1st1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1st1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1st1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1st1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1st1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1st1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1st1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1st1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1st1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1st1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":18,"created_at":"2017-02-24T18:13:13Z","updated_at":"2017-10-02T21:02:03Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/13877","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13877","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13877.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13877.patch"},"body":"This is a follow up to the discussion in https://github.com/atom/language-python/issues/109. Both @50Wliu and @iolsen indicated that they are willing to replace `language-python` with **[MagicPython](https://github.com/magicstack/magicpython)**.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nAtom ships with `language-python` syntax highlighter, which was backported from TextMate. It has a lot of unresolved bugs and lacks many features, such as:\r\n\r\n* Does not highlight [f-strings](https://github.com/atom/language-python/issues/185), [`yield from`](https://github.com/atom/language-python/issues/119), [fails](https://github.com/atom/language-python/issues/150) to highlight `r` string literals properly, [etc](https://github.com/atom/language-python/issues);\r\n\r\n* Does not highlight docstrings as a separate class of strings;\r\n\r\n* [Breaks](https://github.com/atom/language-python/issues/68) on complex function parameters and return annotations;\r\n\r\n* We've paid special attention to little details, such as highlighting `&&` as an invalid operator (makes switching between Python & JavaScript coding easier), properly highlighting improper syntax in decorators and many other features that make it easier to write Python code.\r\n\r\n* MagicPython properly highlights all Python 3 builtins, magic methods, syntax features, string format qualifiers.\r\n\r\n* We have a huge number of [tests](https://github.com/MagicStack/MagicPython/tree/master/test). This makes it easy for us to test new features and bug fixes and make releases with confidence.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above: \r\n\r\n* GitHub.com [uses](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/733ef6319378ab8c76dc72681bf2f435083dbcae/grammars.yml#L56) MagicPython to highlight Python source code.\r\n\r\n* VSCode now [ships](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/tree/master/extensions/python/syntaxes) with MagicPython.\r\n\r\n* MagicPython is already used by more than [69k](https://atom.io/packages/magicpython) Atom users, and [360k](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=magicstack.MagicPython) VSCode users (360k manual installs, bundled MagicPython isn't included in this statistic).\r\n\r\nAt this point, we believe that integrating MagicPython to Atom is easier, than trying to fix `language-python`.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nThe only possible drawback is that MagicPython does not highlight SQL syntax in Python string literals. `language-python` detects when a string starts with `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `WITH` and delegates highlighting to an SQL syntax.\r\n\r\nDue to some limitations of TextMate syntax format, this feature can cause highlighting bugs, such as: https://github.com/atom/language-python/issues/174#issuecomment-266842718 and https://github.com/atom/language-python/issues/143.\r\n\r\nAnother question is why we need to treat SQL specially. There are many other declarative languages (HTML, templates, etc) that people use in Python strings. \r\n\r\nWe think that Python syntax highlighter should only highlight Python language, and highlighting of other languages within Python source code should be delegated to plugins.\r\n\r\n### Integration\r\n\r\nWe've made some changes in MagicPython 1.0.7 specifically for Atom integration:\r\n\r\n* backported `python-console` and `python-traceback` syntaxes;\r\n\r\n* added generation of Jasmine spec files to make MagicPython testable under Atom, see [test/atom-spec](https://github.com/MagicStack/MagicPython/tree/master/test/atom-spec) directory.\r\n\r\nOne thing that this PR does not cover is update of `atom/docs/build-instructions/build-status.md` file. If Atom team approves this PR, we probably need to start testing MagicPython on Atom's TravisCI instance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13877/reactions","total_count":34,"+1":23,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":4,"confused":0,"heart":7}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4166","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507404130","x-github-request-id":"9E40:3670:9ECD84:198E841:59D92805","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=66>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=64>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"fc84bd20028060789e5c1529223a77b6\"","status":"200 OK"}}
