there, it’s been a while since I last got some time to work on Atom.\n\nSo this PR attempt to fix an annoying issue I struggled with for months now, without being able to figure when it came from, but I finally found an explanation. I initially reported it in #9677, but without any clue as to why it was not working properly the issue was closed expected.\n\nSo now, let’s enter the main topic. \n\nLet’s say we create a new package, we’re running it in dev mode, and for the moment there’s no deserializers or registered views for that package. \n\nWhen requiring the main module, we will end up passing in [this branch](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/package.coffee#L442-L444) that will set the `getCanDeferMainModuleRequireStorageKey()` flag to `true`.\n\nNow if we start adding deserializers into our package, since the flag is never turned off, the package main module loading will always be deferred on activation as [this condition will always be true](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/package.coffee#L102), resulting in error if the there’s serialized pane items that need to be deserialized. \n\nOf course, as these settings are scoped using the package version, this is generally not an issue with published packages. If serializers or views are added between two versions the local storage keys will be different  and the previous value will be ignored.\n\nHowever, this issue is making developing a package that have serializers seriously complicated as there’s no longer a way to test them in dev mode once we entered that state (unless knowing that this local storage setting must be removed).\n\nA simple solution here is to simply remove the local storage item if we find that the package now has deserializers or registered views that it didn’t have before.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12513/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12512","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12512/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12512/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12512/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12512","id":173159776,"number":12512,"title":"Uncaught

several places. The current use case that bothers is that `console.log` is used in the [`eslint-plugin-react`](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react) which is used in the widely adopted [`eslint-config-airbnb`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) which is in turn consumed by [`eslint`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) and [`AtomLinter/linter-eslint`](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-eslint).\n- https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-eslint/issues/579 (closed because the AtomLinter team cannot do anything with that)\n- https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/issues/416#issuecomment-177119027 (closed because the issue was not stated properly, or simply comments on closed issues were ignored)\n- https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/978#issuecomment-241332995 (can't be fixed in eslint-config-airbnb yet because of other dependencies)\n- https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/issues/783#issuecomment-241778161 (looks like a won't fix because eslint-plugin-react \"is a Node module, so using console is valid\")\n\nHere's the exception that pops up in Atom:\n\n```\nError: EPERM: operation not permitted, write\n    at Error (native)\n    at Object.fs.writeSync (fs.js:706:20)\n    at SyncWriteStream.write (fs.js:2064:6)\n    at Console.log (console.js:39:16)\n    at EventEmitter.Program (__CENSORED__\\node_modules\\eslint-plugin-react\\lib\\rules\\require-extension.js:103:17)\n    at emitOne (events.js:95:20)\n    at EventEmitter.emit (events.js:182:7)\n    at NodeEventGenerator.enterNode (__CENSORED__\\node_modules\\eslint\\lib\\util\\node-event-generator.js:40:22)\n    at CodePathAnalyzer.enterNode (__CENSORED__\\node_modules\\eslint\\lib\\code-path-analysis\\code-path-analyzer.js:608:23)\n    at CommentEventGenerator.enterNode (__CENSORED__\\node_modules\\eslint\\lib\\util\\comment-event-generator.js:97:23)\n```\n\nHere's one of the faulty lines:\nhttps://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/v3.16.1/lib/rules/jsx-quotes.js#L52\n\n``` js\n      /* eslint-disable no-console */\n      console.log('The react/jsx-quotes rule is deprecated. Please use the jsx-quotes rule instead.');\n      /* eslint-enable no-console */\n      isWarnedForDeprecation = true;\n```\n\nThere are more occurences of this pattern in `eslint-plugin-react`:\nhttps://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/e84af68a3bf48c9a34f14e73a8b4dc1ed7488bab/lib/rules/require-extension.js#L103\n\n``` js\n        /* eslint-disable no-console */\n        console.log('The react/require-extension rule is deprecated. Please ' +\n                    'use the import/extensions rule from eslint-plugin-import instead.');\n        /* eslint-enable no-console */\n        isWarnedForDeprecation = true;\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=console.log&type=Code\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.

This is in contrast with the behavior of all the other macOS applications.  \nUsually when you close an application with the red button and then you re-open it from Dock, the UI is instantly available exactly as you left it when the window was closed.\nSeems like there are two different problems:\n1. The UI completely re-renders on window open\n2. The window state is not preserved when the window is re-opened\n\nLogically I have not checked \"Open empty editor on start\".\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open an Atom's window\n2. Open a project, a file, a tab, whatever\n3. Close the opened Atom's window using the red button\n4. Click on the Atom icon in the Dock to re-open the window\n\n**Expected behavior:** The window is instantly re-opened and I can continue from where I left.\n\n**Actual behavior:** The window is created from scratch, takes several seconds to render its content, and once rendered, I have to reopen the tab/project I was using before I closed it.\n### Versions\n\n```\n~$ atom --version\nAtom    : 1.11.0-dev-579e6b2\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\n~$ apm --version\napm  1.12.5\nnpm  3.10.5\nnode 4.4.5\npython 2.7.12\ngit 2.9.2\n```\n\nThe same problem happens with all the Atom versions\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12497/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12496","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12496/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12496/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12496/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12496","id":172413917,"number":12496,"title":"Uncaught Error: ENOSYS: function not implemented, open '/run/user/1000/gvfs/ftp:host=...","user":{"login":"emersion","id":506932,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/506932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emersion","html_url":"https://github.com/emersion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emersion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emersion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emersion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emersion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emersion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emersion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emersion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emersion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emersion/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":164031162,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/error-from-open","name":"error-from-open","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":192100748,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/network","name":"network","color":"f7c6c7","default":false},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false},{"id":211058624,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/uncaught-exception","name":"uncaught-exception","color":"e11d21","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-08-22T10:04:53Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T19:10:55Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T19:10:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"1.
