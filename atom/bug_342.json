PR does several things related to deferring and minimizing the CoffeeScript compiles done at startup.\n- [x] Extract `coffee-cache` into a separate lib.\n  - This allows it to be more easily setup as early as possible without concerns for being in dev mode.\n- [x] Don't require CoffeeScript until the first `.coffee` file is required.\n  - This saves `~50ms` on startup when all CoffeeScript files are cached or no `.coffee` files are required.\n- [x] Cache generated source maps to disk.\n  - Dev mode is slow because `coffeestack` is used to convert stack traces and so it was compiling CoffeeScript files on startup for any deprecated calls. coffeestack now caches source maps to disk so that compiles won't be needed in between launches.  This dropped dev mode load time from 2 seconds to 1 second for me.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5523","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5523/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5523/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5523/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5523","id":57504572,"number":5523,"title":"List installed packages and themes","user":{"login":"stela5","id":982679,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/982679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stela5","html_url":"https://github.com/stela5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stela5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stela5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stela5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stela5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stela5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stela5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stela5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stela5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stela5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2015-02-12T19:07:35Z","updated_at":"2015-02-16T19:45:33Z","closed_at":"2015-02-12T20:11:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I know Atom takes care of detecting pending updates for installed packages and themes and notifying me, but I can't seem to find where in the settings I can simply view all my installed packages and themes.
