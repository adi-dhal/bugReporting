Notice how the cursor is not rendering at the end of the line where I'm clicking, although when I type, the text is correctly being inserted where it should. \n\nSide note: while investigating this I inspected the editor buffer's displayBuffer, and notice that it has a property called `charWidthsByScope`. I compared some of the `charWidths` before and after the reload and noticed that after reload they are all the same, whereas before the reload they had different values: ![screnshot](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/2Q08350N3m2P1V022k26/Image%202015-05-07%20at%208.38.00%20PM.png) (top is after reload, bottom is before reload).\n\nAlso if you know how I can manually force a 'recalculation' of these values that would be great, as users of my syntax theme are having this issue and I'd like to fix it by forcing the recalculation of these values.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6698/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6697","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6697/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6697/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6697/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6697","id":74212316,"number":6697,"title":"Is version 0.198.0 for OS X with wrong node version?","user":{"login":"fishg","id":1423545,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1423545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishg","html_url":"https://github.com/fishg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722939,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"e6e6e6","default":true},{"id":175213356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/question","name":"question","color":"ededed","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-05-08T03:23:21Z","updated_at":"2015-05-08T11:16:47Z","closed_at":"2015-05-08T06:39:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"when I install  omnisharp-atom,I get this error:\nnpm WARN engine omnisharp-node-client@1.1.4: wanted: {\"node\":\">=0.12.0\",\"iojs\":\">=1.0.0\",\"atom\":\">=0.194.0\"} (current: {\"node\":\"0.10.35\",\"npm\":\"2.5.1\"})\n\nThen I test atom node version:\n/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/apm/bin/node --version\nv0.10.35\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6696","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6696/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6696/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6696/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6696","id":74174929,"number":6696,"title":"child process spawned with child_process.fork cannot spawn an electron-shell ","user":{"login":"golgobot","id":1995486,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1995486?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/golgobot","html_url":"https://github.com/golgobot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/golgobot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/golgobot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/golgobot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/golgobot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/golgobot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/golgobot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/golgobot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/golgobot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/golgobot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-05-08T00:27:23Z","updated_at":"2015-05-11T15:07:54Z","closed_at":"2015-05-11T15:07:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm trying to launch an electron shell from Atom.
