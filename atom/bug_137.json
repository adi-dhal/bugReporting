Running the atom command in the windows command prompt worked fine but gitbash gives the following error.\n\n![Image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12580197/15162400/8ddc48c4-16b7-11e6-89f4-a030b70eb11f.PNG)\n### Solution\n\nI noticed that my user folder \"Terrell Big T Vest\" was being cut off at just \"Terrell\". I guess the shell command wasn't dealing with the space in the directory path. The solution that solved this issue just involved adding double quotes around a portion of the pushd command like so. \n#### Previous Code\n\n[Link to specific line of code](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/f00ac5ca0a4c64f4f1b05c394ec4ecfb70fa59ff/resources/win/atom.sh#L2)\n\n``` sh\npushd $(dirname \"$0\") > /dev/null\n```\n#### Solution Code\n\n``` sh\npushd \"$(dirname \"$0\")\" > /dev/null\n```\n### Atom Version\n\n1.7.3\n### OS Version\n\nWindows 10 version 1511 (OS build 10586.0)\n\n**Expected behavior:** open folder in atom at directory of bash\n\n**Actual behavior:** gave the error provided above via a screenshot and did not open atom.\n### Additional Comments\n\nAgain, I tested the original code in the windows command prompt and everything works as expected. The original code also works on windows when the user folder does not contain any spaces.\nHopefully this change can be made to the atom.sh folder to prevent this issue with others who have a user folder that contains spaces.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11731","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11731/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11731/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11731/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11731","id":154073058,"number":11731,"title":"error","user":{"login":"ChristianCarruego","id":5291422,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5291422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianCarruego","html_url":"https://github.com/ChristianCarruego","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianCarruego/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianCarruego/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianCarruego/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianCarruego/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianCarruego/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianCarruego/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianCarruego/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianCarruego/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianCarruego/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722939,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"e6e6e6","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-05-10T18:19:47Z","updated_at":"2016-05-10T22:17:47Z","closed_at":"2016-05-10T22:17:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I installed the atom, and not allow me to download the packages, the error is:  **Searching for \"package name\" failed.Show output ... it is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.

Description\n\nThe invisible character for spaces disappears once I enter some text. I can understand this being desirable but only expected it to omit the space invisible char when a single space between text occurred. \n\nTab invisibles still render as can be seen in [this bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10733), I was confused with the actual code I was looking at wondering if the alignment was tabs/spaces/mixed or some other invisible since space invisibles were not rendering.\n\nCode snippet:\n\n``` HTML\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <style>\n        h1 {\n            font-size:     \n            font-size      test\n            font-size:     70px;\n            font-size:     \n        }\n    </style>\n<head>\n</html>\n```\n\nImage:\n![invisibles bug](http://i.imgur.com/HIhg9jw.png)\n\nI can verify the same issue with a new JS file `var test =            'space aligned, invisibles don't show'` as well so it's not language specific.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Create a new file.\n2. Note how aligning text with spaces the space invisibles disappear once text occurs. Not the same if tabs are used where they still render.\n\n**Expected behavior:** Invisibles for spaces should still render between text if the length is greater than 1, else an optional render option for this should exist.\n\n**Actual behavior:** Unlike tab invisibles space invisibles disappear.\n### Versions\n\nAtom 1.7.3 OSX

[X] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n\n> I didn't check the debugging guide because this is about a missing `Info.plist` entry and I can't see how debugging would help.\n- [X] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n\n> I found [getting Atom to handle different

the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n\n> Pretty sure this is the only repository that can control Atom's `Info.plist` file.\n- [X] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n\n> I searched both open and closed issues for `UTI`, `public.plain-text`, and `\"default text editor\"` but nothing seemed relevant.\n\nHappy to be corrected about any of this.\n### Description\n\nAfter installing Atom on my Mac, many files (especially those without extensions) still open in (shudder) TextEdit. I took a look in Atom's `Info.plist` file, and also used [duti](http://duti.org/duti.1.html) to check the list of handlers, and it appears that Atom doesn't register for the `public.plain-text` UTI. As a text editor, it really should register with OS X to handle the editing of text files.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Install Atom v1.7.3 on OS X\n2. Open a Terminal window\n3. Type `touch MyAtomTestFile` and press return\n4. Type `open MyAtomTestFile` and press return\n\n**Expected behavior:** I expected the file to open in Atom\n\n**Actual behavior:** The file opens in TextEdit (or perhaps another editor depending on what you have installed).\n\n(You'll probably also want to `rm MyAtomTestFile`, too.)\n### Versions\n\nOS X 10.11.4 (15E65).\n\n`$`**`atom --version`**\n\n```\nAtom    : 1.7.3\nElectron: 0.36.8\nChrome  : 47.0.2526.110\nNode    : 5.1.1\n```\n\n`$`**`apm --version`**\n\n```\napm  1.9.2\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.10\ngit 2.7.4\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11710","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11710/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11710/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11710/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11710","id":153536828,"number":11710,"title":"Atom fails to build on Windows 10","user":{"login":"DamnedScholar","id":4084322,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4084322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DamnedScholar","html_url":"https://github.com/DamnedScholar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DamnedScholar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DamnedScholar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DamnedScholar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DamnedScholar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DamnedScholar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DamnedScholar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DamnedScholar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DamnedScholar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DamnedScholar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98407029,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/build-error","name":"build-error","color":"f7c6c7","default":false},{"id":62363277,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-05-06T20:57:51Z","updated_at":"2016-05-13T07:12:08Z","closed_at":"2016-05-13T06:50:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [ ] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode)?\n- [X] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [X] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [X] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [X] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [X] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nI would like to manage my versions of Atom via building the executables from source, but I've been unable to successfully build anything with script/build.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.

called](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/72721af3c63fd0d0bd0b0dd196ff28a3cab9ba11/src/pane.coffee#L347) when `ctrl` is released (`ctrl-tab ^ctrl`) seems to not affect the pane to show at all, it should just change the stack. Yet it changes behaviour of tab switching.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11699/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11698","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11698/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11698/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11698/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11698","id":153203679,"number":11698,"title":"Consistency within OS X","user":{"login":"will1818","id":12893761,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/12893761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/will1818","html_url":"https://github.com/will1818","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will1818/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will1818/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will1818/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will1818/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will1818/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will1818/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will1818/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will1818/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will1818/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-05-05T10:11:06Z","updated_at":"2016-05-05T13:12:52Z","closed_at":"2016-05-05T13:12:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi all, just wanted to raise this design flaw - although flaw is a strong word. \n\nOn OS X all of the close tab \"X's\" are on the left hand side of the tab throughout the OS (Safari, Finder, Terminal..) however in Atom they're on the right! It would be great to have a setting allowing them to be repositioned to the left, allowing for more consistency within OS X.\n\nMany thanks,\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11698/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4094","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507404130","x-github-request-id":"B409:2B99:1C3D61:429EEF:59D92923","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=138>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=136>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"7c3496989c10a7532baa566e4574d025\"","status":"200 OK"}}
