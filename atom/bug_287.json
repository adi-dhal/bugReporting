In recent versions of atom, regardless of where the scroll position was in the file, the tooltips displayed by these plugins would be appropriate for what appeared at the top and leftmost \"screenfull\" of the file based on the mouse position.\n\nFor example:\n\n![ExampleBadTooltip](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3755379/8022613/7f25bd5e-0cab-11e5-9501-e2e20f23ef11.png)\n\nThe `ICompilePromise` tooltip was appropriate for that x position on line 17 of the file - not line 207.\n\nWe reported it here: https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/issues/381 and came up with this fix: https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/pull/384 which was adding these two lines in the code that determines the mouse position:\n\n``` js\npixelPt.top += editor.displayBuffer.getScrollTop();\npixelPt.left += editor.displayBuffer.getScrollLeft();\n```\n\nThese tooltips had been working correctly up until perhaps a week or two ago.  I suspect this was due to some sort of change in Atom to the output of `getBoundingClientRect()`, or `editor.screenPositionForPixelPosition()`, or `editor.bufferPositionForScreenPosition()`.\n\nMy questions are - do you believe that this is correct, and if so, was this intentional?  Do you think this new behavior will stand or is it a bug?  To my knowledge atom-typescript didn't have any calls that were marked as deprecated prior to this bug emerging.\n\nI looked through the recent patch notes and didn't see anything that sounds like it should have caused this problem.  Thanks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7192","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7192/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7192/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7192/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/7192","id":86710666,"number":7192,"title":"Delete partially off-screen markers which are empty","user":{"login":"as-cii","id":482957,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/482957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii","html_url":"https://github.com/as-cii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-06-09T19:36:41Z","updated_at":"2015-06-10T09:59:07Z","closed_at":"2015-06-09T22:04:52Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/7192","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/7192","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/7192.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/7192.patch"},"body":"- :fire: Delete old code which was written to support some non-batched\n  methods in a previous version;\n- :white_check_mark: Cover “partially off-screen markers which are\n  empty” scenario, since that [code path](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/f830623512fe69c287f17fd5e02b9ad9dca401ad/src/text-editor-presenter.coffee#L1274) was not being hit by `TextEditorPresenter` specs;\n\nFixes #7183\n\n/cc: @izuzak @nathansobo @maxbrunsfeld \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7192/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7191","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7191/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7191/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7191/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7191","id":86701222,"number":7191,"title":"Atom under Windows keeps lagging","user":{"login":"visualcookie","id":1857554,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1857554?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/visualcookie","html_url":"https://github.com/visualcookie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/visualcookie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/visualcookie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/visualcookie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/visualcookie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/visualcookie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/visualcookie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/visualcookie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/visualcookie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/visualcookie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":52925411,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/performance","name":"performance","color":"d4c5f9","default":false},{"id":62363277,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":48,"created_at":"2015-06-09T19:09:52Z","updated_at":"2017-01-22T21:32:20Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\n\nfirst, great changes so far... but after the upgrade to v2.0 it keeps on lagging for me as a Windows user.
