No surprise there.\n- multiparty's test fixtures are pretty big, especially multi_video.upload (1.9MB compressed all by itself!). Maybe they can be omitted?\n- There are two copies of `git2.a`, each about 1.4MB compressed. They aren't the exact same size, but maybe there's a way to get away with just one?\n- Looks like the `settings-view`, `release-notes`, and `markdown-preview` packages all include their own copy of `emoji-images`, which has lots of biggish files in it. Can they all share one copy somehow?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1375","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1375/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1375/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1375/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/1375","id":25212199,"number":1375,"title":"Properly

I've replaced non-replication oriented features that were previously handled by telepath with smaller npm packages.\n- **[text-buffer](https://github.com/atom/text-buffer)** This handles the storage of text and markers that was previously dealt with in telepath strings. It also implements the undo system for buffers.\n- **[theorist](https://github.com/atom/theorist)** This provides a `Model` superclass that will provide the reactive features that proved to be valuable from Telepath models. Model subclasses allow you to subscribe to $-prefixed reactive behaviors for any property, declare derived reactive properties with `.behavior`, and will soon include facilities for defining reactive collections with relational operators. It took me a couple tries to find a good name, so if you see references to `reactionary` or `atomic-model` in commits, that's this library.\n- **[serializable](https://github.com/atom/serializable)** This provides a convenient mixin for implementing `::serialize` and `.deserialize`. It's completely optional, meaning anyone can implement those methods on their own, but it removes a lot of the boilerplate. I think this package should also provide the deserializer manager and eventually incorporate support for migrations.\n\n**What's the plan for replication going forward?**\n\nI think I had it exactly backwards. Instead of wrapping a replication layer with the application's model, we should wrap the application's model with a replication layer. I think Telepath should be transformed into an unobtrusive wrapper library that can wrap any JavaScript object graph and automagically replicate it to another site. I think we can pull off something seamless by combining the new ES6 `Object.observe` API, ES5 `WeakMap`s, and everything I learned implementing references in the last attempt. I'd like something like this to be possible:\n\n``` coffee\n{Replicant} = require 'telepath'\n\n# start with a plain old javascript object\natomA = new Atom(mode: 'editor') \n\n# build a replicant wrapper based on this object\nreplicantA = new Replicant(atomA) \n\n# replicate it (this is for tests, across the wire we'd serialize)\nreplicantB = replicantA.replicate(siteId: 2) \n\n # extract a fresh plain-old object from the replica\natomB = replicantB.root\n```\n\nThe end user never needs to interact with telepath. They just modify properties on the plain objects and telepath picks up their changes and replicates them transparently. This keeps telepath out of the critical path for the single-user case because it's bolted on from the outside only when needed. It also means we can expand the scope of replication in an ad-hoc fashion, starting with a single buffer and moving outward.\n\nFiner-grained control of what properties are replicated is still possible on a per-object and per-class basis. Here's a sketch of what I'm thinking:\n\n``` coffee\n# exclude instances of an entire class from being replicated\nreplicant.disable(TreeView)\n\n# only replicate particular properties for instances of a certain class\nreplicant.enable(Pane, 'items')\n\n# dynamically enable / disable replication for certain instances\nreplicant.enable(focusManager)\n```\n\nAgain, the key is we can start small and only pay for what we use.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1347","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1347/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1347/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1347/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/1347","id":24909164,"number":1347,"title":"Update atom-shell to v0.8.x","user":{"login":"zcbenz","id":639601,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/639601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz","html_url":"https://github.com/zcbenz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":16,"created_at":"2013-12-31T02:05:45Z","updated_at":"2014-07-16T15:30:00Z","closed_at":"2014-01-16T16:49:55Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/1347","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/1347","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/1347.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/1347.patch"},"body":"- [ ] Make native modules compile on Windows\n- [x] Make native modules compile on Mac\n- [x] Fix sandbox of coffee script\n- [x] Web view is blank on the first run\n- [ ] The `CFBundleVersion` field of `Info.plist` is sometimes empty\n- [x] Make specs pass\n- [x] Initial size is sometimes `{width: 0, height: 0}`\n- [x] Crash caused by setTimeout in third party native modules (https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/issues/153)\n- [x] process.nextTick does not work sometimes (https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/pull/154)\n- [x] Task can not receive messages from child process sometimes (https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/issues/156)\n- [x] FATAL ERROR: v8::HandleScope::CreateHandle() Cannot create a handle without a HandleScope (https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/commit/931182b677e81c4bf6922193478af861193d952c)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1347/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4672","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"EC7E:366F:C0C4E3:177A980:59D92DF2","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=481>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=479>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"556131c68b020ba9336982a59580eb58\"","status":"200 OK"}}
