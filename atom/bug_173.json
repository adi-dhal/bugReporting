I think this issue is partly addressed in #1666 but I feel that starting a new conversation about performance on Retina displays is necessary since it is unbearable right now.\n\nI used a tool called [Retina Display Menu](https://roaringapps.com/app/rdm-retina-display-menu) to quickly switch between Normal & Retina Displays and used Dev Tools to capture this information while I pressed Arrow Down key a few times to scroll a 400 line .js file:\n#### Non-Retina\n\n![Non-Retina](http://i.imgur.com/r8GDjcP.png)\n#### Retina\n\n![Retina](http://i.imgur.com/Sbtng1Q.png)\n\nIt seems quicker to complete on retina screen but the general experience was really bad due to low FPS. Although it only shows information about a few seconds, it might give you an idea about how it lacks responsiveness on a Retina screen, and this holds true even when writing code (Although not as extreme as scrolling). \n\nBtw, experience on retina screen with `atom --safe` seems much better **compared to retina in normal (non-safe) mode** but I do not think it is related to any package since it is still not as good as **`atom --safe` with non-retina**. \n\nSo, any ideas about where to start to fix this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10644/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10643","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10643/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10643/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10643/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10643","id":130497953,"number":10643,"title":"native features in atom isn't complate","user":{"login":"msudgh","id":11756815,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11756815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msudgh","html_url":"https://github.com/msudgh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msudgh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msudgh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msudgh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msudgh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msudgh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msudgh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msudgh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msudgh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msudgh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-02-01T22:00:36Z","updated_at":"2016-02-01T22:23:02Z","closed_at":"2016-02-01T22:10:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"i have problem with atom and It does not have enough native features.\ni think if atom want to have good speed must be have native snippet, no packages.\ncheck bottom review.\n![atom](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11756815/12732767/4959f88a-c94c-11e5-8d6d-5e2f0b52d9b0.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10643/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10642","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10642/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10642/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10642/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10642","id":130491867,"number":10642,"title":"Replace preview does not translates matching groups","user":{"login":"roolo","id":173141,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/173141?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roolo","html_url":"https://github.com/roolo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roolo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roolo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roolo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roolo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roolo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roolo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roolo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roolo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roolo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-02-01T21:37:27Z","updated_at":"2016-02-01T21:44:36Z","closed_at":"2016-02-01T21:42:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I found out, that when I use regex matching groups in both Find in project and Replace in project, the matching group is not translated in the preview (see picture).

Atom has different keyboard shortcut defaults based on platform. On Mac, it uses `cmd`, and on Windows, `ctrl` for many modifier combos.\n\nThe goal is to have the Windows keyboard shortcut defaults on a Mac. This could end up being able to choose which set of keyboard shortcuts to use. Or even alias control to command via a hook as [mentioned here](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2349#issuecomment-45924381).\n\nFor now, a possibility is to write a script to swap them all and put them in the `keymap.cson` or copy of the [platform specific configs](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/keymaps/win32.cson) into `keymap.cson`.\n\n---\n\nI am using [ShareMouse](http://www.keyboard-and-mouse-sharing.com/)_([Synergy](http://synergy-project.org/) is another alternative)_ so I can seamlessly move from a Windows machine to Mac with one set of keyboard/mouse. But this also means that I often hit the wrong key combo the first time, using `Ctrl+C/V` on mac, etc.\n\nFor basic shortcuts, such as copy/paste or anything else listed in the top menu, you can use [this trick](http://superuser.com/a/363355/130885) to alias it over. But many of the atom commands are in the internals that can't be mapped this way.\n\nAs an aside, if someone knows how to map `ctrl` key events to `cmd` on Mac, this would be a solution. _note:_ swapping the functionality via _System Preferences -> Keyboard -> (Keyboard tab) Modifier Keys..._ only applies to the keyboard hooked up to the mac itself and the physical keyboard in my setup is on the Windows machine. Probably would work to have it the other way around though.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10620","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10620/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10620/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10620/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10620","id":129805717,"number":10620,"title":"Atom keep changes when I change branch.","user":{"login":"dody87","id":3058417,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3058417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dody87","html_url":"https://github.com/dody87","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dody87/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dody87/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dody87/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dody87/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dody87/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dody87/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dody87/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dody87/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dody87/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-01-29T15:51:42Z","updated_at":"2017-06-21T16:53:38Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"When I have a clean repo and change to another branch, then it conserves my changes from previous one and showing invalid code on it.\n\nAtom 1.4.1 OSX version.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10620/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10619","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10619/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10619/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10619/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10619","id":129797216,"number":10619,"title":"Atom is really slow when typing ","user":{"login":"alejomendoza","id":5351127,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5351127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejomendoza","html_url":"https://github.com/alejomendoza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejomendoza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejomendoza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejomendoza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejomendoza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejomendoza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejomendoza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejomendoza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejomendoza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejomendoza/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":52925411,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/performance","name":"performance","color":"d4c5f9","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-01-29T15:28:28Z","updated_at":"2017-01-05T16:31:44Z","closed_at":"2016-12-15T16:05:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"So it would take like a lot of time for the letters to show up when I type.
