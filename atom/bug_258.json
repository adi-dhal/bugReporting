this has been raised before or if this is the wrong repo, please correct me. I couldn't find a previous issue for it. I've raised this issue at the atom linter repository originally, see https://github.com/atom-community/linter/issues/758, but we felt this was a more widespread issue and not the responsibility of the linter package.\n\nConsidering that [linter might get integrated into the atom core](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7353), it's probably a good idea to handle this issue in atom core anyway.\n\nThe problem is with panels that open up at the bottom of the Atom window (e.g. find & replace, linter) while you are working on code which is at the bottom of a file. These panels overlap your code when they open, hiding the code from view and forcing you to scroll up.\n\nType something erroneous at the bottom:\n![ss](https://www.dropbox.com/s/aplhj66dn0mohfv/Screenshot%202015-07-21%2011.57.04.png?dl=1)\n\nPanel shows up and overlaps your code:\n![ss](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qqren1bvolmc2l9/Screenshot%202015-07-21%2011.57.35.png?dl=1)\n\nThe problem is particularly troublesome with automatically opened windows, like linter. The find & replace panel never bothered me like that, because it's triggered manually with a keyboard command, so you're not focussed on typing code anyway. But with the linter panel, you are, and it's very disturbing to have the panel suddenly show up and block your view of your code.\n\nA proposed work around has been to enable the setting \"Scroll Past End\", but while this alleviates the issue a little bit, it doesn't solve it and it can still happen when you forgot to scroll further up.\n\nA better solution would probably be for the panels to not overlap the editor window, but rather push it up causing it to shrink. I realize this might cause the opposite problem though, e.g. if you're typing at the top of the file, then that code would be pushed out of view.\n\nAny idea's?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8068/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8067","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8067/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8067/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8067/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8067","id":97133260,"number":8067,"title":"ES6 syntax hi-light for const destructuring assignment not showing  ","user":{"login":"tuantle","id":4650277,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4650277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuantle","html_url":"https://github.com/tuantle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuantle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuantle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuantle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuantle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuantle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuantle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuantle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuantle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuantle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-07-24T19:59:17Z","updated_at":"2015-07-24T20:08:38Z","closed_at":"2015-07-24T20:08:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"ES6 syntax hi-light for const destructuring assignment not showing .
