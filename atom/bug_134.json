is the first time I try to create an atom syntax theme.  \n\nI have :  \n1. Used the Generate Atom Syntax Theme\n2. Wrote custom css / less in the files\n3. At a random moment the project wouldn't compile anymore, with an error saying somewhat that the theme wasn't real as it hasn't a real repository yet\n4. I copied the /styles directory and index.less outside atom folders, and it perfectly compiled to a correct css file\n5. I tried validating the LESS code on the official less test tool : http://lesscss.org/less-preview/ and was fully successful\n6. I even could compile the LESS files with any LESS compiler Atom package (tried a few)\n7. I created a repository and officially pushed the syntax theme to Atom\n8. I removed every package or theme previously installed\n9. Installed the popsicles-syntax theme\n10. Cried in the inside because it wasn't working and I was getting the exact same error...\n    ### Steps\n11. Install package\n12.

But sometimes it fails, and since I don't realise but I open atom as soon as the system finish boot, once I open up a terminal, bash automatically runs the script and try again to mount my working dir and all my files opened in Atom workspace get automatically saved and replaced with blank files.\n**Please help me provide a better title and ask for more information if there is some need for a better understanding.**\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Enable autosave\n2. Mount a drive\n3. Open a file in the mounted folder\n4. Enable the option for atom to save the workspace\n5. Close atom\n6. Unmount the drive\n7. Open atom (Atom opens the file as blank, not finding it)\n8.
