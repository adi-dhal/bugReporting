many developers, I constantly use **shift-cmd-left** and **shift-cmd-right** to select full lines. This command is designed to select up to the first and last character of the line. As of yesterday, it seems that it began selecting all the way to the beginning of the line (including indentation/tabs) in some very random cases.\n\nIn the screenshots attached, you'll notice that in 2 separate JSON files and 2 separate LESS files, the same command results in 1 correct result and 1 incorrect result. I am not noticing any patterns in the code or file formats that may hint at any weird problem. It feels as though it just picks some files to fail in and others to succeed in. It appears to work fine in every JS file, however.\n\nPerhaps I am missing or forgetting something.
