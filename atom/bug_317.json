Whenever I run chrome and atom together, I loose the ability to cut and paste in chrome, in fact right click menu doesn't always work in chrome either.\n\nThis has only happened since I upgraded atom to 189 and only when I run the two together (I notice chrome version in atom was updated in 189).\n\nI have had to go back to using ST2 since this shows it's face at the worst moments, timing is random but it always happens at least once a day requiring a re start, or complete kill of chrome and all processes.\n\nI am running Ubuntu Gnome 64bit, chrome Version 41.0.2272.118 (64-bit) and atom 189. Problem happens at least once a day and completely screws chrome browser. I have ran ST2 for a few days now and am no longer getting the issue so atom is definitely causing this since i updated to 189.\n\nta\n\nPaul\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6279/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6278","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6278/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6278/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6278/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6278","id":66770682,"number":6278,"title":"2 Deprecated Calls | Atom Core","user":{"login":"mattlovaglio","id":10821303,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10821303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattlovaglio","html_url":"https://github.com/mattlovaglio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattlovaglio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattlovaglio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattlovaglio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattlovaglio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattlovaglio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattlovaglio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattlovaglio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattlovaglio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattlovaglio/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2015-04-07T04:13:04Z","updated_at":"2015-04-20T11:43:58Z","closed_at":"2015-04-07T19:35:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Since the last update, Deprecation Cop lists 2 issues. \nRunning OS X Yosemite 10.10.2\nAtom Version 0.189.0 (0.189.0)\n\nOnce my JavaScript knowledge is up to par, I hope to help fix these things myself.
