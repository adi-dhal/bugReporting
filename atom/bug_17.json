I have a command bound to alt-n (a composing diacritic in the macOS US keyboard layout) that moves the cursor. Under Atom 0.19 the keystroke would run the command and insert the diacritic. On this edge version, it only runs the command, which is awesome. 🎉 \r\n\r\nBUT, it seems like some internal buffer state then gets messed up. If after the alt-n I move the cursor with the arrows, and then insert a character, the cursor seems to jump back to where the alt-n left me, and the character gets inserted there. If I use a command that isn't a composition character, like `alt-o`, then the problem does not occur.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n#### Keymap\r\n\r\n```\r\n'atom-text-editor':\r\n  'alt-n': 'core:move-down'\r\n  'alt-o': 'core:move-down'\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. Add the keymap above to your ~/.atom/keymap.cson\r\n2. Have two lines of text in your buffer:\r\n```\r\nFoo\r\nBar\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Have the cursor at the beginning of file(before `F` character) Type `alt-n`, then arrow right, then insert a character. Observe that the character is inserted at the beginning of the line (where the `alt-n` left you).\r\n4. Repeat 2-3 using `alt-o` instead of `alt-n`. Observe the insertion happens where the cursor is, as expected.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Character insertion following `alt-n` inserts the character where the cursor is.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Character insertion following `alt-n` inserts the character at the wrong place (seems to be where the `alt-n` leaves you).\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Always.\r\n\r\n###

In `editor.setScrollTop`\r\n  scrollTop updated from xxx to `522`.\r\n1. `editor.onDidChangeScrollTop` fired with (scrollTop = `522`)\r\n2. In onDidChangeScrollTop callback, call `markerLayer.clear()` which markerLayer is used for text decoration.\r\n3. `editor.onDidChangeScrollTop` fired again(goto step 1, this is infinite loop)\r\n  - In some place, `editor.component.getScrollTop` is accessed which update `component.scrollTop` to `521.65625`)\r\n  `this.scrollTop = Math.min(this.getMaxScrollTop(), this.scrollTop)` = Math.min(521.65625, 522)\r\n  - During etch's rendering, `component.setScrollTop` is called with `548.65625`.\r\n    - result of `scrollTop = Math.round(Math.max(0, Math.min(this.getMaxScrollTop(), scrollTop)))`\r\n    - result of `scrollTop = Math.round(Math.max(0, Math.min(521.65625, 548.65625)))`\r\n    - result of `scrollTop = Math.round(Math.max(0, 521.65625))`\r\n    - result of `scrollTop = 522`\r\n    - scrollTop = `522`\r\n  - `did-change-scroll-top` fired with `522` (`522(rounded) !== 521.65625(<- this.scrollTop updated via getScrollTop)`)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Make sure `editor.scrollPastEnd` is `false` (default).\r\nWhen `editor.scrollPastEnd` is `true` this issue doesn't happen.\r\n\r\n2. Prepare `style.less` bellow. paste&call `reproduceIssue()` on chrome-dev-console.\r\n\r\n- style.less\r\n\r\n```less\r\n@import \"octicon-mixins\";\r\n.scrolltop-issue-container {\r\n  padding: @component-padding/3 @component-padding;\r\n}\r\n\r\natom-text-editor {\r\n  .scrolltop-issue-text-hl {\r\n    color: @syntax-color-function;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction reproduceIssue() {\r\n  atom.workspace.open().then(editor => {\r\n    // Render 40 lines of text to make editor scrollable.\r\n    const lines = []\r\n    for (let i = 1; i < 40; i++) {\r\n      lines.push(i)\r\n    }\r\n    editor.setText(lines.join(\"\\n\"))\r\n\r\n    editor.setCursorBufferPosition([0, 0])\r\n\r\n    // To make editor.component.maxScrollTop() have fractional portion(decimal point).\r\n    const item = document.createElement(\"div\")\r\n    item.className = \"scrolltop-issue-container\"\r\n    item.innerText = \"[block decoration]\"\r\n    editor.decorateMarker(editor.markBufferPosition([0, 0]), {type: \"block\", item})\r\n\r\n    // prepare decoration layer for text highlight\r\n    const markerLayer = editor.addMarkerLayer()\r\n    editor.decorateMarkerLayer(markerLayer, {type: \"text\", class: \"scrolltop-issue-text-hl\"})\r\n\r\n    let oldScrollTop\r\n    editor.onDidChangeScrollTop(newScrollTop => {\r\n      console.log(\"fired\")\r\n\r\n      // This guard is necessary to prevent infinite loop.\r\n      // if (oldScrollTop === newScrollTop) {\r\n      //   return\r\n      // }\r\n\r\n      // Refresh highlight\r\n      markerLayer.clear()\r\n      editor.scan(/1|3|5|7|9/g, ({range}) => markerLayer.markBufferRange(range))\r\n\r\n      oldScrollTop = newScrollTop\r\n    })\r\n  })\r\n}\r\nreproduceIssue()\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Move cursor down by `core:move-down`\r\nWhen last row was appeared, editor freeze by infinite loop on `onDidChangeScrollTop` event. Need to force close.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\n\r\n`editor.onDidChangeScrollTop` should not be fired when not changed.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\n\r\n`editor.onDidChangeScrollTop` is emitted with same scrollTop value which possibly cause infinite loop(depends on registered callback).\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\n\r\n100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nOS\r\n```\r\nProductName:\tMac OS X\r\nProductVersion:\t10.12.5\r\n```\r\n\r\nAtom(All stable/beta/master affects).\r\n\r\n- Stable\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.19.1\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Beta\r\n```\r\natom-beta  --version\r\nAtom    : 1.20.0-beta2\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd master branch\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nOriginal issue I hit this issue.\r\nhttps://github.com/t9md/atom-narrow/issues/239\r\n\r\n\r\nThis guard \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/blob/15e3fbaa07f90174ab84d35a4281956b54128d12/src/text-editor-component.js#L2713\r\n\r\nshould be `scrollTop !== Math.round(this.scrollTop)`.\r\n\r\nSince calling `getScrollTop` update `this.scrollTop` with non rounded value.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/blob/15e3fbaa07f90174ab84d35a4281956b54128d12/src/text-editor-component.js#L2707\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15342","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15342/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15342/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15342/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15342","id":250726067,"number":15342,"title":"Window is blank on Mac","user":{"login":"NeuralyzerGaming","id":31077943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/31077943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeuralyzerGaming","html_url":"https://github.com/NeuralyzerGaming","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeuralyzerGaming/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeuralyzerGaming/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeuralyzerGaming/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeuralyzerGaming/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeuralyzerGaming/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeuralyzerGaming/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeuralyzerGaming/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeuralyzerGaming/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeuralyzerGaming/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2017-08-16T18:57:06Z","updated_at":"2017-08-19T04:18:24Z","closed_at":"2017-08-18T09:26:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nI got atom and I know very little about programming HTML etc.  I wanted to get into it and I found out about the atom. I downloaded and installed it and it worked for a while. About an hour later, it completely stopped working. For whatever reason, when I open atom, it shows the window and it does not have anything besides the title of the window and all the commands on the top of my screen next to the apple sign. (command bar thing)\r\n\r\nTrouble Shooting:\r\n1. I deleted atom. (re- downloaded it from site)\r\n2. restarted computer \r\n3. turned off Kaspersky Security\r\n4. went through almost every setting on the command bar.\r\n5. went to \"library -> application support -> Atom\" and deleted that. \r\n6. re-downloaded it from website\r\n7. deleted anything else that would effect atom\r\n8. restarted a few times\r\n9. re downloaded atom \r\n\r\nNo matter what I did, I could not get it to operate like it did when I first downloaded it. I think I may have been some command I did because it was right after I initiated a \"command q\" or something.(not sure) \r\n\r\nAlso, when I hit \"create buffer\" I see a large text box and I see parts of huge letters.
