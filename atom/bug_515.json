CEF checked in to the repo makes the repo big and cloning super slow. I propose we move CEF out of the repo and just download it as needed. Specifically, I propose:\n1. We set up a new repo whose sole purpose is to build CEF. Basically we'd take [`script/update-cef`](https://github.com/github/atom/blob/1190644e76d7b99d72c153837124e2ebdf07ad41/script/update-cef) and move it to a new repo.\n2. In the new repo, add a `script/cibuild` that\n   1. Builds CEF (duh)\n   2. Zips it up (with a name that includes the CEF version)\n   3. Uploads it to S3\n3. Add a file to the github/atom repo that specifies which version of CEF should be used.\n4. Change either `script/bootstrap` or `Rakefile` to download and unpack the version of CEF listed in the file.\n\nHow does this sound? Basically we'd be creating our own binary releases of CEF and hosting them on S3, then downloading them before building Atom.\n\nIf we wanted to get really crazy we could use `git filter-branch` to remove the old versions of CEF. That would shrink the repo and make cloning super :rabbit2::dash:\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/279","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/279/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/279/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/279/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/279","id":11014433,"number":279,"title":"Invisible characters preceding function names are bolded in atom-light-syntax","user":{"login":"nathansobo","id":1789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo","html_url":"https://github.com/nathansobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2013-02-14T21:29:29Z","updated_at":"2013-02-15T18:36:05Z","closed_at":"2013-02-14T22:58:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"![Screen Shot 2013-02-14 at 2 27 59 PM](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1789/158617/921a5ede-76ed-11e2-96ec-003d1684e8c9.png)\n\nThought I'd mention that I'm kinda not liking bold function names in general, but that's another conversation.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/279/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/278","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/278/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/278/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/278/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/278","id":11013166,"number":278,"title":"Change split view bindings","user":{"login":"nathansobo","id":1789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo","html_url":"https://github.com/nathansobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2013-02-14T20:53:57Z","updated_at":"2013-02-22T18:10:28Z","closed_at":"2013-02-15T17:40:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/278","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/278","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/278.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/278.patch"},"body":"I wanted to give people a chance to comment on this before merging it in.
