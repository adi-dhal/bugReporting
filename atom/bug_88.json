Once I kill this process, Atom starts.\r\n\r\n- It is worth noting that `atom --version` or other command line flags that wouldn't start Atom's UI don't show that issue.\r\n- It might also be worth mentioning: if atom is already running, running `atom somefile` works, and it opens the file in the running instance.\r\n- When an instance is already running, running `atom somedirectory` opens a new atom window without problem as well.\r\n\r\nI tried deleting the whole `~/.atom` folder. The problem persists. Tried disabling packages, same thing.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nI'm on Xubuntu 16.10. I remember some updates to my system yesterday...

closed and pane was destroyed, remaining paneItem(editor) not correctly focused so I have to manually click by mouse.\r\nIt's very tedious, this issue is only happens in current beta(v1.13.0-beta2), no issue in stable(v1.12.1).\r\n\r\nMaybe shadowDOM removal have some cause.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n- Confirm `Remove Empty Panes`(`core.destroyEmptyPanes`) is `true`(this is default value).\r\n- Open some text-editor.\r\n- Split editor into **two** by `cmd-k right`(or `cmd-k down` is OK), the point is **there are two panes in workspace**.\r\n- Close pane item by `cmd-w`, then that pane is destroyed.\r\n- The remaining editor on remaining pane don't get focused(expected: focus to remaining editor)\r\n\r\n### Comparison of document.activeElement from Chrome

#9406.\r\nFixes #13084.\r\n\r\nWhen Atom is launched from the Dock, we invoke the user shell to retrieve environment variables that are assigned by their profile settings. However, we were doing so synchronously during startup, thus causing a [major slowdown](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9406) when opening Atom from the Dock and sometimes [hanging the startup process indefinitely](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13084).\r\n\r\nWith this pull request, we are changing `updateProcessEnv` into an asynchronous method. Packages that require shell environment variables to be assigned prior to activation can use the new `core:loaded-shell-environment` activation hook by putting the following snippet in `package.json`:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\"activationHooks\": [\"core:loaded-shell-environment\"]}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will defer packages' activation until `process.env` has been updated with the user

Description\r\n\r\nAtom completely destroys special characters in files when changing encoding. I mean, I get that stuff can go wrong since it's probably supposed to convert the file. But maybe it should check what the encoding is and not assume that it's utf-8 and destroy the file? (It saves the file and CTRL+Z cannot revert it)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Put åäö in a file, save as iso8859-1 and close it\r\n2. Set default encoding to utf-8\r\n3. open the file and make some edit before changing encoding (sometimes I forget to check the file encoding before opening)\r\n4. set encoding to iso8859-1\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nI expected to be able to edit files in the correct format without changing the default file encoding in the preferences each time i open a file\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\nSpecial characters gone, I don't know why but CTRL+z stopped working, file is ruined (it's way too big to fix manually).\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\natom

However, I'm pretty sure it's the correct repo, and I did try to search for a pre-existing issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe \"not responding\" messages clearly states that an editor is not responding. To most people that would mean the current tab. However, if you click \"closed editor\" the whole entire window is closed. This, in my experience, breaks user expectation.\r\n\r\nSee screenshot in #9185.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Find a way to get a \"not responding\" message box up\r\n2. Click on \"Close\"\r\n3. Cry when it takes away everything you were working on\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Obviously it depends on what is actually unresponsive, but if, as it was in my case, it's because you decided to click on a minified JS file in the treeview (and after about 50ms you *knew* it was a bad idea), it'd be great to constrain the collateral damage to the currently open editor/tab/textbuffer (whatever it is) and only take that down (like Chrome does).\r\n\r\nIf it is a plugin that's running 'globally' or something similar, then of course, the window probably needs to burn.\r\n\r\nBut in the real world, I'm guessing it's not easy (if not impossible) to differentiate between the two (I bet syntax parsing/highlighting all happens in the big main thread as we're talking JS here right?). So, as a compromise, maybe just make the message say that the *window* will go bye-bye, not the \"editor\" (as it's not clear to normal users what \"editor\" means.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** The message says the *editor* is not responding, but the whole window goes if you click \"close\".\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\n❯ atom-beta --version\r\nAtom    : 1.13.0-beta0\r\nElectron: 1.3.6\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n❯ apm-beta --version\r\napm  1.14.1\r\nnpm  3.10.5\r\nnode 4.4.5\r\npython 2.7.12\r\ngit 2.9.3\r\n```\r\n\r\nOSX 10.11.6.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13190","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13190/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13190/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13190/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13190","id":188688026,"number":13190,"title":"/usr/bin/atom: line 111: 13463 Segmentation fault  ","user":{"login":"chanble","id":3293670,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3293670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chanble","html_url":"https://github.com/chanble","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chanble/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chanble/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chanble/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chanble/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chanble/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chanble/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chanble/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chanble/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chanble/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-11-11T05:29:01Z","updated_at":"2016-11-15T08:09:28Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"atom -f .\r\n[13463:1111/131853:ERROR:browser_main_loop.cc(231)] Running without the SUID sandbox!

holding was changed from Atom v1.13.0-beta0.\r\nWhich was hold text-editor-element in v1.12 but its changed to hold hidden-input-element.\r\nSo code like `event.target.getModel()` no longer work from v1.13.\r\n\r\nIs this intentional change or accidential change?\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nDefine following command in `init.coffee`, and invoke it via command-pallette or via keymap(both results are same).\r\n\r\n```coffeescript\r\natom.commands.add 'atom-text-editor', 'dev:show-event-target-of-text-editor-scope', (event) ->\r\n  console.log event.target\r\n  # following line throw exception from v1.13.0 since its no longer hold texxt-editor-element\r\n  # console.log event.target.getModel()\r\n```\r\n\r\n- In atom v1.12.0: `<atom-text-editor class=\"editor vim-mode-plus normal-mode\" tabindex=\"-1\" data-grammar=\"source coffee\" data-encoding=\"utf8\"></atom-text-editor>`\r\n- In atom v1.13.0-beta: `<input class=\"hidden-input\" tabindex=\"-1\" data-react-skip-selection-restoration=\"true\" style=\"transform: translateZ(0px); top: 155px; left: 84px; width: 7px; height: 18px;\">`\r\n\r\nSo package code `event.target.getModel()` no longer work

Start Atom (Normal or Safe Mode)\r\n2. Click any item in top menubar (it will not render at this step)\r\n3. Move mouse down from clicked menu (it will now render normally, as shown)\r\n[http://imgur.com/77uDta4](url)\r\n4. Move mouse back up to top menubar, then slide right to another item (it will partially remove the previously rendered menu, as shown)\r\n[http://imgur.com/QndZ7Wf](url)\r\n5.
