can't count anymore how many times I've wanted to install a new package, went to settings, clicked \"Packages\" and started to type the package name in the search box waiting and staring at the screen while nothing happened...\n\nThe two interfaces \"Packages\" and \"Install\" are so similar that it's really hard to keep the two apart. Why don't we merge them into one, called \"Packages\" to avoid confusion?\n\nTo me it seems intuitive that if you want to install \"packages\" you go and click on \"packages\" first, especially since that's the first item that you see when you're scanning the menu options from top to bottom.\n\nEven adding a \"install new packages\" button in the \"packages\" section linking to the \"install\" section would help tremendously I think.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12315","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12315/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12315/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12315/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12315","id":169212877,"number":12315,"title":"Windows 10 1607 Build 14393.10 - \"Open with Atom\" doesn't work","user":{"login":"Lordmau5","id":1345036,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1345036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lordmau5","html_url":"https://github.com/Lordmau5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lordmau5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lordmau5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lordmau5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lordmau5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lordmau5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lordmau5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lordmau5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lordmau5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lordmau5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":62363277,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":14,"created_at":"2016-08-03T19:27:39Z","updated_at":"2016-09-09T08:31:08Z","closed_at":"2016-08-07T02:37:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [ ] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n\nFor more information on how to write a good [bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) or [enhancement request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\nI updated to the Win10 Anniversary Build today and wanted to edit some files, but whenever I select the specific option in the context menu (right-click), Windows asks me which program I should use to open the specific file with.\n\nI also reinstalled Atom already, just to be safe.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.
