not sure what to call this issue, please rename it.\n\nI quit Atom to get around another instance of #1231. There was allegedly an update pending. After I quit:\n\n```\n$ atom\nLSOpenURLsWithRole() failed for the application /Applications/Atom.app with error -10810.\n```\n\nI assume this happens when the `atom` helper is invoked during `finish_installation`'s run. `finish_installation` is also a bad name for an app that shows up in a user's dock, even briefly.\n\nRunning `atom` again starts the shell, but crashes immediately, I would copy/paste the exception here, but I can't copy text from the web inspector.\n\nI figured I'd run `atom -f` to get the backtrace in my terminal, but I forgot to shut down Atom first.

When I reopened Atom, it still has the tree-view and buffers from all the files I had open in the other branch., _plus_ the files and directories in the new branch. The tree-view doesn't reflect reality at all.
