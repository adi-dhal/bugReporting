This means that Nuclide's `atom.directory-provider` service hook will be called earlier in Atom's startup process, before project deserialization and notably before Nuclide's `activate` method is called. It also means that custom `Directory` instances for which `.existsSync()` returns `false` will _not_ be added to the project, so you may need to handle the state where the user has not yet authenticated specially in that method.\n\nAlso note that the `atom.directory-provider` service must be specified in Nuclide's top-level package.json (rather than being registered dynamically) in order to be recognized.\n\nSorry for requiring you to make these changes, but we really need to fix #10297, which was introduced by changes that we made together in order to accommodate Nuclide in the first place, so it doesn't seem too unreasonable.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12694/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12693","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12693/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12693/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12693/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12693","id":176938957,"number":12693,"title":"Suggestion: Use webpack to reduce `require` calls","user":{"login":"amilajack","id":6374832,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6374832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amilajack","html_url":"https://github.com/amilajack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amilajack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amilajack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amilajack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amilajack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amilajack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amilajack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amilajack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amilajack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amilajack/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-09-14T15:28:13Z","updated_at":"2016-09-16T16:12:59Z","closed_at":"2016-09-16T15:26:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Using webpack can significantly reduce the number of require calls during startup time.

report](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) or [enhancement request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\nWhen opening a second atom window from the CLI it triggers OS X Sierra native tabs in some case(s?). I could reproduce this in safe mode and after a factory-defaults reset.\n\nThis may or may not be an Electron issue though I could not produce it in another Electron app.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. have a 2 monitor setup\n2. open terminal (iTerm in my case) full screen on monitor 2\n3. in terminal `cd` to any project\n4. in terminal `atom .`\n5. atom opens on monitor 1 (**instance 1**)\n6. put **instance 1** in OS X fullscreen mode if it is not and keep it in foreground on monitor 1\n7. in terminal `cd` to any other project\n8. in terminal `atom .`\n\n**Expected behavior:** Atom opens **instance 2** in a second window (fullscreen optional)\n\n**Actual behavior:** **instance 2** opens in a native tab\n\n![atom-native-tabs](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/38758/18503304/7d5b6e40-7a5c-11e6-9ae4-f7ae56d8eb23.png)\n\n**Work-around:** in step 6, make sure atom is nowhere in foreground\n\n**Notes:** AFAIK issue could not be produced with one monitor, considering you need atom in fullscreen foreground to trigger this issue. If you have a terminal that can overlay your fullscreen Atom I'm guessing you can also produce this issue.\n### Versions\n\nmacOS Sierra 10.12 GM\n\n```\nAtom    : 1.10.2\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12690/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12689","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12689/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12689/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12689/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12689","id":176833691,"number":12689,"title":"Upgrade Electron to v1.3.6","user":{"login":"thomasjo","id":3622,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasjo","html_url":"https://github.com/thomasjo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasjo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasjo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasjo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasjo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasjo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasjo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasjo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasjo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasjo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":258255692,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/electron","name":"electron","color":"A5ECFA","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-09-14T07:22:10Z","updated_at":"2016-09-15T14:56:33Z","closed_at":"2016-09-15T11:51:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/12689","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12689","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12689.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12689.patch"},"body":"This might need some manual testing.

This is Atom event subscriber I use:\n\n``` javascript\neditorView.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {\n    console.log(event.keyCode);\n});\n```\n\nAnd it works perfect for other keyboard layouts.\n\nNative JS in HTML test page (out of Atom):\n\n``` javascript\ndocument.onkeydown = function(event) {\n    console.log(event.keyCode);\n};\n```\n\nIn Chrome browser it gives the correct `keyCode` even for Korean and Japanese input. So issue is Atom-specific.\n\n**Expected behavior:** `keyCode` for `keydown` event on `q` should be equal to **81** (example).\n\n**Actual behavior:** `keyCode` for `keydown` event on `q` equals to **229** (like any other keys).\n### Versions\n\nAtom 1.10.0\nUbuntu 16.04

If you haven't already seen the alert, try to install a new package from the package manager\n\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]\nWhen I search for a package, I expect to see results.\n\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\nA trojan alert is displayed by my antivirus and I do not see my search results afterwards.\n### Versions\n\nAtom 1.10.2\nWindows 10 Pro x64\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12679/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12678","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12678/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12678/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12678/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12678","id":176573789,"number":12678,"title":"Syntax highlighting without file extension","user":{"login":"LIyoai","id":6205123,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6205123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LIyoai","html_url":"https://github.com/LIyoai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LIyoai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LIyoai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LIyoai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LIyoai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LIyoai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LIyoai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LIyoai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LIyoai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LIyoai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-09-13T07:51:14Z","updated_at":"2016-09-13T13:42:58Z","closed_at":"2016-09-13T13:42:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\n\nWhen I open a file without file extension I have no syntax highlighting at all.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. create a xml file without extension\n2. open it\n3. rename file to .xml\n4. open it\n\n**Expected behavior:**\nIf no file extension available atom could check the content of the file (maybe just the first line) to choose the correct syntax highlighting.\n\n**Actual behavior:**\nno file extension = no highlighting\n### Versions\n\nAtom    : 1.10.0\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\nWindows 7 64-Bit\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12677","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12677/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12677/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12677/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12677","id":176569950,"number":12677,"title":"Cursor in unexpected position when moving it while selecting","user":{"login":"Download","id":153391,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/153391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Download","html_url":"https://github.com/Download","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Download/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Download/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Download/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Download/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Download/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Download/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Download/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Download/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Download/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-09-13T07:29:50Z","updated_at":"2017-09-26T20:48:00Z","closed_at":"2017-09-26T20:30:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Observed in Atom 1.10.2 on Windows 10 Home using Atom One UI Theme and Atom Light syntax theme.\n1. Create a new file and enter some lines of text in it. Make sure there are around 40 characters per line.\n2. Position your cursor somewhere halfway the second line (say, column 20)\n3. Hold Shift and move the cursor up one line using the arrow Up key\n4. Observe: The cursor is in the expected position, line 1 column 20, exactly one column above where it was before, and text from where the cursor is now up to where it was before is now selected\n5. Release the Shift key\n6. Press the Up key on the keyboard\n7. Observe: The text is no longer selected (expected)\n8. Observe: The cursor is now at the beginning of the line (column 1) (**not** expected)\n9. Press the Down key on the keyboard\n10. Observe: The cursor is now on line 2, column 1.\n\nExpected behavior: Since we started on line 2 and are on line 1 at step 6, it's not possible to go up one more line so I would expect the cursor to remain where it is. I do expect to lose the selection when I attempt to move the cursor, but I don't expect it to move to the beginning of the line. \n\nThe problem with the current behavior is that when you do Up, Down, you don't return to where you were before. This gives unexpected cursor 'jumps' when editing.\n\nI compared with Microsoft Notepad and Notepad++\n\n**MS Notepad:**\nBehaves as I would expect. The cursor remains at it's position when we press Up on line 1, selection is lost\n\n**Notepad++**\nHas some mysterious behavior of itself. It also moves the cursor to column 1 when we press up (like Atom), but, crucially, when we press Down it moves the cursor back to where it was. This is actually also unexpected\n\nI guess it's a minor issue. But I've found myself selecting the wrong stuff / deleting the wrong parts of a line etc when editing from muscle memory and I've traced it back to this quirk. I think it would improve the editing experience if it was fixed.\n\nAlso, note that if we don't hold Shift when moving Up and Down, Atom behaves as Notepad++:\nWhen we press Up while the cursor is on line 1, it visually moves to the beginning of the line, however if we then press Down it actually moves back to where it was before, therefore maintaining command symmetry. This behavior changes (for the worse imho) when we hold Shift to select some text.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12677/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12676","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12676/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12676/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12676/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12676","id":176569039,"number":12676,"title":"Atom crashes opening a big text file","user":{"login":"louisrubet","id":6287486,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6287486?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisrubet","html_url":"https://github.com/louisrubet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisrubet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisrubet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisrubet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisrubet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisrubet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisrubet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisrubet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisrubet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louisrubet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-09-13T07:24:53Z","updated_at":"2016-09-14T14:25:04Z","closed_at":"2016-09-13T16:27:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n- [ ] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [ ] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [ ] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [ ] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [ ] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nAtom shows a popup saying \"The editor has crashed.

Each Pane will notify its PaneAxis, which will then remove the Pane from its list of children. This all works as long as the container's root is a PaneAxis, however, when you go from 2 to 1 Panes, the PaneAxis will reparent the last Pane making it the container's root. From that point on, `PaneContainer::getPanes()` will delegate to [the (destroyed) Pane](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/v1.11.0-beta5/src/pane.coffee), which returns a list that includes itself.\n\nMy gut says that the right way to address this is to never have a Pane be the root (e.g. always contain it in a PaneAxis) but I don't really know.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12674/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12673","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12673/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12673/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12673/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12673","id":176465039,"number":12673,"title":"Ensure pane is added to container before invoking onDidAddPane listeners","user":{"login":"nathansobo","id":1789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo","html_url":"https://github.com/nathansobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-09-12T19:39:27Z","updated_at":"2016-09-12T19:39:38Z","closed_at":"2016-09-12T19:39:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/12673","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12673","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12673.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12673.patch"},"body":"Fixes #12654\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12673/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12672","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12672/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12672/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12672/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12672","id":176421784,"number":12672,"title":"Don't wait for spec windows to save state","user":{"login":"nathansobo","id":1789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo","html_url":"https://github.com/nathansobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-09-12T16:30:49Z","updated_at":"2016-09-12T17:07:18Z","closed_at":"2016-09-12T16:54:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/12672","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12672","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12672.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12672.patch"},"body":"Since spec windows don't register handlers for the IPC messages requested window state to be saved, the promise never resolves and the close button needs to be clicked twice.
