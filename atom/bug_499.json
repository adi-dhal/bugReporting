The first question I'd like to pose is how we plan to handle the public documentation for Atom.\n## Presentation\n\nWill we be treating it like GitHub, with something like `help.atom.io` where docs live? Or will it go more of the open source project route, where you find docs in the repo directory?\n\nI personally prefer the dedicated site route. It gives a better opportunity to provide nice docs for people that want to learn how Atom works, or how to mod it. This also lets us separate the concerns of learning how to use the app (website) from documentation about the development of the app (/docs folder).\n## Content\n\nWho will write the docs?

On the one hand, we want to provide rich, browsable documentation for the consumers of our APIs. This is clearly critical to the success of our community. On the other hand, we we want the experience of _working_ with documented source code to be as smooth and lightweight as possible and keep our source files looking sexy.\n\nSo far, the discussion has been about the full fidelity of TomDoc vs. the compactness and lower maintenance burden of less a less formal approach. After pondering this for a while, I think that by innovating on our documentation format we can satisfy all of these concerns. With this PR, I'd like to start a conversation about what that format might look like.\n\nWhile it's true that TomDoc is a standard of sorts, I don't think it's meeting our needs well. My main criticism is that it feels very bulky, and it's causing our source files to feel extremely cluttered. We need a format that's simple for simple methods–on the order of a single line–but that also scales smoothly to five, ten, or even more lines as the need for documentation increases. I think this proposal can provide that.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/749/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/748","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/748/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/748/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/748/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/748","id":18449088,"number":748,"title":"Soft wrap tweaks","user":{"login":"kevinsawicki","id":671378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/671378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinsawicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2013-08-23T01:06:40Z","updated_at":"2013-08-24T01:18:39Z","closed_at":"2013-08-24T01:18:24Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/748","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/748","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/748.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/748.patch"},"body":"- [x] Store soft wrap state on `DisplayBuffer` instead of `EditSession`\n- [x] Listener for soft wrap state changes in `Editor`\n- [x] Always calculate the soft wrap column and set it on the display buffer\n- [x] Remove edit session defaults from `Project`, just put them in their appropriate locations\n- [x] Rename `softWrapColumn` to `editorWidthInChars`\n- [x] Add preference to always soft wrap at preferred line length (`editor.softWrapAtPreferredLineLength`)\n\nFixes #703, #721\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/748/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/747","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/747/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/747/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/747/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/747","id":18433621,"number":747,"title":"API Documentation Improvements","user":{"login":"mcolyer","id":1424,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1424?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer","html_url":"https://github.com/mcolyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":23,"created_at":"2013-08-22T19:17:34Z","updated_at":"2014-07-16T00:37:07Z","closed_at":"2013-08-27T17:17:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/747","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/747","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/747.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/747.patch"},"body":"So the goal of this is PR is to do a first pass at updating the API docs.
