all,\n\nIf I apply the ‘text-rendering: optimizeLegibility’ directive to the stylesheets on .editor or .workspace, any subsequent command palettes, text fields or tabs have a visually broken/erratic caret:\n- In text fields, such as the command palette or settings view, the caret appears before the first character even though it's actually pointing to the end of the text;\n- Moving the caret left and right in an editor tab sometimes causes it to jump several places left and right of where it should be, there doesn't seem to be any discernible pattern and reloading the tab causes different breakages to happen.\n\nThis issue only affects new tabs/palettes created after the stylesheet change occurs, it seems.  Similarly, removing the stylesheet change only takes effect for new tabs/palettes.\n\nI'm running Atom HEAD on Gentoo Linux, 64-bit, not using the react editor.\n\nNot sure which part of Atom this applies to, so I've filed it against atom/atom (sorry!)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2617","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2617/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2617/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2617/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2617","id":35757706,"number":2617,"title":"automatic

If the last active tab was an editor view, the whole atom window renders blank light grey, except for the menubar. This doesn't happen if Atom starts into e.g. the settings view and then I switch to an editor tab. Also this only happens with the React editor enabled. Resizing the window or reloading with ctrl+alt+r makes the content visible again.\n\nMaybe it's something about the window dimensions not updating early enough and that causing confusion in the React editor? Just a guess, though.\n\nI'm on Arch Linux 64-bit, Atom built from the latest master (46e1a9254d) with no additional plugins or settings.
