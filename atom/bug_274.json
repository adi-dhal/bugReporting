Hi folks,\n\nI'm going to have to say sorry in advance for what is going to be a very vague bug report. I'll do everything I can to help you dig up the details you need though\n\nAfter I updated to 1.0 :tada: I noticed that on occasion my machine would stop being responsive to the keyboard and mouse - sort of. Making mouse movements seemed delayed, text input basically stopped working. While this was occurring, it was very difficult for me to even open activity monitor to check which app was causing the problem. Atom was one of the few apps open in the doc, I managed to force quit the app and every suddenly returned to normal.\n\nTonight it happened again, only worse. Atom seemed to be on auto pilot, deleting line by line what I was working on. My mouse and keyboard would take no input. The only way I could record what was happening was with my ipad - [here is my shaky recording](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2texc0ral95t84p/atom%20bug.mov?dl=0). I had to hard reset my machine. \n\nLet me know what other information I can get which will make this easier to pin point. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7579/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7578","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7578/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7578/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7578/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7578","id":92043769,"number":7578,"title":"resize pane not work when atom running under guest OS under virtualbox with mouse intergration on","user":{"login":"tsing80","id":9977225,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9977225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsing80","html_url":"https://github.com/tsing80","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsing80/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsing80/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsing80/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsing80/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsing80/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsing80/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsing80/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsing80/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsing80/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-06-30T09:42:03Z","updated_at":"2015-07-02T14:26:09Z","closed_at":"2015-07-02T14:25:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Host OS: WIndows 7\nGuest OS: Ubuntu LInux\n\nWHen running atom under the guest os , the resize icon is not display when the mouse cursor is between two pane.

This caused problems when auto-indenting lines in a hard-tabbed file that contained “alignment spaces”, such as occurs in aligned comment blocks. For this case, it makes more sense to assume that the line is indented via tabs only, and consider the subsequent alignment space as part of the line’s content.
