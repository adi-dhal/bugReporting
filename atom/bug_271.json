But we are using shared drive at work, and when I access it via smb:// and I try to open any file, Atom opens with window title correctly saying \"filename - smb://path/to/ - Atom\", in tree view I see filename with folder icon, but file itself looks empty.\n\nIf I type something in a file and save, original file does not seem to change (opened with gedit). _Edited: It actually creates folder named \"smb:\" in my home directory, and saves file here._\n\nBut if I now close and again open file in Atom, file does not even open but red notification appears, saying:\n\nUncaught Error: ENOTDIR:
