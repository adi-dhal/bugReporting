Because they are called `atom-beta` and `apm-beta`. Secrets and lies!\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Install Atom Beta (I'm on OSX, with no Atom non-Beta installed).\n2. Open Atom Beta, click the menu option `Atom > Install Shell Commands`.\n3. Atom displays an alert stating \"Commands installed. The shell commands 'atom' and 'apm' are installed.\"\n4. Open a fresh terminal and type `atom` or `apm`. The command is not found.\n\n**Expected behavior:** I expect the commands displayed in the alert to work verbatim. My preference would be for the alert window text to read `atom-beta` and `apm-beta`.\n\n**Actual behavior:** The commands need to be suffixed with `-beta`, or they will not work and you probably won't know why...\n### Versions\n\nOSX 10.11.4\n\n```\n$ atom-beta --version\nAtom    : 1.8.0-beta2\nElectron: 0.36.8\nChrome  : 47.0.2526.110\nNode    : 5.1.1\n\n$ apm-beta --version\napm  1.9.2\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.11\ngit 2.7.2\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11572","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11572/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11572/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11572/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11572","id":150367364,"number":11572,"title":"`core:copy-selection` doesn't copy.","user":{"login":"MichaelJCole","id":1504790,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1504790?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelJCole","html_url":"https://github.com/MichaelJCole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelJCole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelJCole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelJCole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelJCole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelJCole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelJCole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelJCole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelJCole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelJCole/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722939,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"e6e6e6","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-04-22T13:16:48Z","updated_at":"2016-10-14T05:58:27Z","closed_at":"2016-10-14T05:58:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\n\nAs referenced in #11542, this keyman.cson should copy only when text is selected.\n\n```\n'atom-text-editor':\n  'ctrl-c': 'core:copy-selection'    # linux and windows\n```\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. change cson\n2. select new text\n3. ctrl-c\n4.

For example, I often need to change <$> to <*> in Haskell, but Atom does not show where in the ligature the cursor is, and I often lose time erasing the wrong part of the ligature.\nSimilarly, I will often try to delete the space before an arrow -> , but I end up deleting the first dash - because the cursor is shown beside the ligature, even when its actual position is in the middle.\n\nIdeally, when the cursor was at the edge of, or inside a ligature, it would be rendered not as the single character, but as the actual simple characters which make it up.\n\nIs this possible? If it is not, consider this a request that it be added, or at least supported in a package.\n\nThanks!\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Set the font to FiraCode, HaskLig, or another ligature-supporting font\n2. Enter a ligature, such as `->`\n3. Move the cursor from one side to the ligature of the other\n\n**Expected behavior:** The ligature is decomposed into its constituent characters, or the cursor is shown inside the ligature.\n\n**Actual behavior:** The cursor remains to the right of the ligature.\n### Versions\n\nI've tested in 1.7.1, but it showed up in all previous versions I'd used.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11567/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11566","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11566/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11566/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11566/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11566","id":150227415,"number":11566,"title":"Project Folders are removed when window is closed","user":{"login":"juilyoon","id":516726,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/516726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juilyoon","html_url":"https://github.com/juilyoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juilyoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juilyoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juilyoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juilyoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juilyoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juilyoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juilyoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juilyoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juilyoon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722939,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"e6e6e6","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-04-22T00:28:34Z","updated_at":"2016-04-27T20:47:44Z","closed_at":"2016-04-26T22:09:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\n\nWhen you close every window without quitting the program, all the project folders are removed the next time you open a window.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.

Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nAfter updating to Atom 1.7.2 and reverting the `ctrl-tab` and `ctrl-shift-tab` behavior via the config in the release blog post:\n\n```\n'body':\n  'ctrl-tab ^ctrl': 'unset!'\n  'ctrl-tab': 'pane:show-next-item'\n  'ctrl-shift-tab ^ctrl': 'unset!'\n  'ctrl-shift-tab': 'pane:show-previous-item'\n```\n\n`ctrl-tab` and `ctrl-shift-tab` no longer tab through panes in order if they have been rearranged via drag-and-drop or if you are using the `Add New Tabs At End` config option from the `tabs` core package and open a file with an active tab somewhere in the middle of the list.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Copy the config block from the MRU Tab Change blog post into your `keymap.cson` file.\n2. Open 3-5 files from the tree / fuzzy open / however. Verify that you can `ctrl-tab` through them in order.\n3. Drag-and-drop to rearrange them, or enable `Add New Tabs At End` in the `tabs` core package and select a tab other than the last, then open a file via the tree or the fuzzy finder.\n4. Attempt to `ctrl-tab` and see that the order for selection is wrong.\n\n**Expected behavior:** You can `ctrl-tab` through your open files in order as you could in Atom < 1.7.x releases.\n\n**Actual behavior:** `ctrl-tab` does not progress through visual tab order and instead appears to follow the order of when the files were opened.\n### Versions\n\n```\n$ atom --version\nAtom    : 1.7.2\nElectron: 0.36.8\nChrome  : 47.0.2526.110\nNode    : 5.1.1\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11563/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11562","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11562/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11562/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11562/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11562","id":150138282,"number":11562,"title":"Use ohnogit","user":{"login":"joshaber","id":13760,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/13760?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber","html_url":"https://github.com/joshaber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-04-21T17:20:45Z","updated_at":"2016-04-22T15:49:14Z","closed_at":"2016-04-22T15:49:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/11562","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11562","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11562.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11562.patch"},"body":"We’ve pulled the brains of `GitRepositoryAsync` out into its own package: https://github.com/github/ohnogit\n\nThis lets others use it for projects other than Atom.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11562/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11561","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11561/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11561/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11561/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11561","id":150122453,"number":11561,"title":"Text cursor blinking after stopping switch between windows using ALT + TAB","user":{"login":"samuelyeshua","id":5921505,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5921505?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelyeshua","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelyeshua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelyeshua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelyeshua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelyeshua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelyeshua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelyeshua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelyeshua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelyeshua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelyeshua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelyeshua/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-04-21T16:22:15Z","updated_at":"2016-04-21T19:38:20Z","closed_at":"2016-04-21T19:38:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**Description:**\ntext cursor just disappears when I switch between open windows on the desktop using the rotation buttons.

This is because Atom is performing a synchronous call to `dialog.showMessageBox` instead of an async one.  In addition, there is no code in place to automatically close the dialog if/when Atom does regain responsiveness.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Get Atom into an unresponsive state and have the \"keep waiting\" dialog appear\n2. Wait for Atom to become responsive again\n3. :zzz:\n\n**Expected behavior:** Atom to regain responsiveness\n\n**Actual behavior:** Atom hangs forever until an option is selected\n### Versions\n\n```\nAtom    : 1.9.0-dev-8ece1ee\nElectron: 0.36.8\nChrome  : 47.0.2526.110\nNode    : 5.1.1\n```\n\n```\napm  1.9.2\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.10\ngit 2.7.0.windows.1\nvisual studio 2015\n```\n\nWindows 10 x64.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11551/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11550","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11550/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11550/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11550/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11550","id":149898853,"number":11550,"title":"build: [ci skip] add lint npm script","user":{"login":"BrainCrumbz","id":3185573,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3185573?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrainCrumbz","html_url":"https://github.com/BrainCrumbz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrainCrumbz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrainCrumbz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrainCrumbz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrainCrumbz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrainCrumbz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrainCrumbz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrainCrumbz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrainCrumbz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrainCrumbz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":163641905,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/atom","name":"atom","color":"f7c6c7","default":false},{"id":193722948,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-review","name":"needs-review","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-04-20T22:00:11Z","updated_at":"2016-09-29T19:37:45Z","closed_at":"2016-09-29T19:37:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/11550","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11550","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11550.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11550.patch"},"body":"Aim: to be able to invoke only linting from command line, as opposed to the whole (long) build process.
