I noticed four distinct problematic behaviours:\r\n\r\n- it takes around three dozen presses of the left or right arrow keys to step into a half-dozen-letter Syriac word, through it, and back out of it again\r\n- it is almost impossible to place the cursor at the intended Syriac letter using the mouse\r\n- once you click into a Syriac word, the cursor disappears\r\n- (this one is minor) Syriac letters don't obey the letter width of fixed-width fonts such as Courier New\r\n\r\nTaken together, these issues are unfortunately a deal-breaker for me. I also have to edit documents combining other RTL and LTR languages and it is day-to-day work for me. This is unfortunate, because I really like that Atom always keeps the document left-aligned instead of deciding alignment line-by-line as e.g. gedit does.\r\n\r\nI suspect a connection of what I'm experiencing here to what is described in #4682.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. open atom\r\n2. paste below text into the editing area\r\n3. position cursor before the first letter\r\n4. keep right arrow key pressed; notice time it takes the cursor to move through non-Latin parts of the document\r\n5. try other things described above\r\n\r\n```\r\nOlafbeṯ I - *Alphabet I* - ܐܳܠܰܦܒܶܬܼ ܐ.

Unfortunately some shortcuts are defined with alt+ combinations, like alt+o (default) this doesn't cause problems in most applications, since they can differentiate left alt from right alt.

with font rendering on Windows 10 since a while now. I've already tried to fix it with CSS and adjust the ClearType text, but nothing happened. My screen resolution is `1366x768`. \r\n\r\nWhen I click somewhere on the screen, the font goes back to normal for a few seconds, then slowly blurs back again (as you can see below). It would be nice to fix this, I'm sticking to Sublime Text until I find a solution. Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n![blurry](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17071218/20652572/de127754-b4e2-11e6-8e28-a0179501d272.png)\r\n![blurry](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17071218/20652768/27dc0aa4-b4e7-11e6-90b5-5f42c3059e15.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.
