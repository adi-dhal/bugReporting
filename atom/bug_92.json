**N/A**\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n\nFor more information on how to write a good [bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) or [enhancement request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\nPackages using `grammar-used` activation hooks don't actually reactivate if disabled and then re-enabled in settings, even if they were active prior _and_ there are editors currently using hooked grammar.\n\nIn particular, they don't trigger on package update, which is confusing to end-users (see e.g. https://github.com/atom-haskell/ide-haskell-repl/issues/39)\n\nFWIW, I see these options to fix this:\n1. When package is enabled, check for currently open editors using relevant grammar and trigger `grammar-used` hook\n2. Store `grammar-used` trigger state per-window and trigger newly-loaded packages\n3. Store `grammar-used` trigger state per-package per-window\n\nOf course, there's a fourth option of 'wontfix' but it'd be kind of sad.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Install [activation-hook-test](https://github.com/lierdakil/activation-hook-test) package (not published, clone from git, there are no dependencies, so `apm link` should be enough)\n2. Open an `.md` file or select `Github Markdown` grammar for a currently open file -- bottom panel will show up:\n   \n   ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7275622/19785541/68752d78-9ca2-11e6-85fd-ae6fedae7624.png)\n   If it doesn't, make sure `Github Markdown` grammar is selected.\n3. Disable activation-hook-test package -- bottom panel will disappear\n4. Enable activation-hook-test package\n\n**Expected behavior:** Bottom panel reappears\n\n**Actual behavior:** Bottom panel doesn't appear. But it does when reproduction step 2 is re-done.\n### Versions\n\nOS: Gentoo Linux, x86_64\n\n```\n$ atom --version\nAtom    : 1.11.2\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\n$ apm --version\napm  1.12.5\nnpm  3.10.5\nnode 4.4.5\npython 3.4.5\ngit 2.10.1\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13088/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13087","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13087/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13087/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13087/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13087","id":185741890,"number":13087,"title":"Update transpilation pipeline","user":{"login":"BinaryMuse","id":189606,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/189606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse","html_url":"https://github.com/BinaryMuse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":193722947,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/work-in-progress","name":"work-in-progress","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"BinaryMuse","id":189606,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/189606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse","html_url":"https://github.com/BinaryMuse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"assignees":[{"login":"BinaryMuse","id":189606,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/189606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse","html_url":"https://github.com/BinaryMuse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true}],"milestone":null,"comments":14,"created_at":"2016-10-27T18:13:22Z","updated_at":"2017-02-27T23:16:35Z","closed_at":"2016-10-28T20:26:37Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/13087","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13087","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13087.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13087.patch"},"body":"Currently, the Atom transpilation story, via the compile cache, is as follows:\n- All TypeScript (`.ts`) files are compiled with the TypeScript compiler.\n- All CoffeeScript (`.coffee`) files are compiled with the CoffeeScript compiler.\n- JavaScript (`.js`) files are compiled with the Babel compiler _if_ they start with `/** @babel */`, `\"use babel\"`, `'use babel'`, or `/* @flow */`. Atom currently uses Babel 5 to transpile JS, and sets some explicit options in `static/babelrc.json`.\n\nIn addition, the `ThemeManager` uses `LessCompileCache` to compile Less (`.less`) files to CSS.\n\nIn an ideal world, individual packages would have more control over how exactly their source is transpiled before being run in Atom. A best case scenario would be that a package author can specify _exactly_ how we should transform their source. At a minimum, packages should be able to pick-and-choose which JavaScript transformations are applied to them by specifying their own options in a local `.babelrc` and including any additional Babel plugins as appropriate.\n\nTo start with, I'm updating Babel to version 6 while attempting to keep the resulting JavaScript as similar to the Babel 5 version as possible, to avoid breaking existing packages.\n- [x] Update to Babel 6\n  -

Sometimes Atom works just fine despite this, and you only realise later when you wonder why your system is slow, and kill the extraneous process. Sometimes closing Atom takes the rogue shell process with it, and sometimes it outlives Atom. Sometimes everything works fine and I can't reproduce it at all.\n\nEither way, safe mode or not has no effect on it, and nothing bright turns up with `--enable-logging`.

Since the `--harmony` flag was the only flag set in that function, I also removed the `setupJavascriptArguments` function and the one call to the function.\n### Alternate Designs\n\nv1.4.x of Electron, which is based on Chromium v53, doesn't suffer from the bug that the `--harmony` flag exposes. Our [Electron v1.4 update PR](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12696) is still not quite ready to merge, so we decided to just remove the flag.\n### Benefits\n\nPeople won't experience random crashes when executing async code in Atom v1.12.x and above.\n### Possible Drawbacks\n\nThere may be some packages that rely on features provided by `--harmony` that aren't available in the vanilla JavaScript support in Chromium or less likely aren't available in Atom's Babel support.\n### Applicable Issues\n\nFixes #13073 \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13080/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13079","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13079/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13079/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13079/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13079","id":185469480,"number":13079,"title":"Weird characters after hard reseted PC","user":{"login":"klapuch","id":17772194,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/17772194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klapuch","html_url":"https://github.com/klapuch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klapuch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klapuch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klapuch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klapuch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klapuch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klapuch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klapuch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klapuch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klapuch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-10-26T18:13:59Z","updated_at":"2016-10-31T18:12:08Z","closed_at":"2016-10-31T18:12:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [ ] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [X] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [X] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [X] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [X] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nMy computer unexpectedly stopped working while I had open a few files in Atom.

However I found that tabType/indent_style is not respected when starting/restarting/window:reloading atom. \n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Set your global preference for tabs to auto, 2 spaces and check show invisibles. Inject a settings file in your favorite language-X package:\n\n``` coffeescript\n'.scope.Name':\n  'editor':\n    'tabType': 'hard' #this doesn't seem to do anything.\n    'softWrap': true\n    'indent_style': 'tab' #this actually makes it an \\x09\n```\n1. do a window:reload, type a tab when back up. Should be a tab character, but it's two spaces.\n2. Quit Atom and restart it, type a tab in the file after session is restored, it's again two spaces.\n3. Change something in the `settings/language-X.cson` file and save it, do a window:reload. You might now get a tab character, or you might get two spaces. Can't see a pattern, seems random.\n\n**Expected behavior:** settings/language-X.cson should **always** override global settings.\n\n**Actual behavior:** ([screencast of bug in action](https://bugout.regex.cf/tabissues.mp4)) settings/language-X.cson seems to randomly be reloaded when modified, or only when switching to another language and then back to this one.\n### Versions\n\nAtom    : 1.11.2\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\nOS: 10.10.5\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13070/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13069","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13069/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13069/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13069/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13069","id":185281877,"number":13069,"title":"Uncaught Error: Cannot read property 'object' of undefinedTypeError: Cannot read property 'objec...","user":{"login":"markten","id":1667867,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1667867?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markten","html_url":"https://github.com/markten","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markten/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markten/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markten/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markten/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markten/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markten/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markten/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markten/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markten/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722939,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"e6e6e6","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-10-26T02:30:35Z","updated_at":"2016-10-26T02:43:56Z","closed_at":"2016-10-26T02:43:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[Enter steps to reproduce below:]\n1.

replace does not work given a lookahead pattern.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open a buffer containing some text to search over. For instance, `const object = { 'key': 'value' }`\n2. Open find-and-replace (Ctrl-F or Cmd-F) and turn Regex on.\n3. Enter a search string containing a lookahead in the Find field (for instance, `'(?=.*:)`), and click Find. Notice that the matched strings are properly highlighted.\n4. Click \"Replace\" or \"Replace All\".\n\n**Expected behavior:** One or all of the strings are replaced with the given replacement string (or deleted if the replace field is blank).\n\n**Actual behavior:** Nothing happens.\n### Versions\n\n1.11.2, Windows 10.0.14393 Build 14393\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13068/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13067","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13067/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13067/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13067/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13067","id":185108736,"number":13067,"title":"Broken links","user":{"login":"Devinsuit","id":11741306,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11741306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Devinsuit","html_url":"https://github.com/Devinsuit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Devinsuit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Devinsuit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Devinsuit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Devinsuit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Devinsuit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Devinsuit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Devinsuit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Devinsuit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Devinsuit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":104428530,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-10-25T12:52:41Z","updated_at":"2016-12-27T12:03:02Z","closed_at":"2016-12-27T12:03:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"https://atom.io/docs/api/v1.11.2/AtomEnvironment -
