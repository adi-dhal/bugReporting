Description of the Change\r\n\r\nThis few lines of extra code should add the possibility to manage Code-Folding efficiently. At the time, if you want to develope anything around Code-Folding, the only possibility is to permanently check if a row is folded (with the \"isFoldedAtBufferRow()\" function).\r\n\r\nThe problem is: every line inside the block i folded, also gets recognized as folded. So I can't check if maybe a sub-block is also folded\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nMaybe it would be better to use these events:\r\nonDidFolded\r\nonDidUnfolded\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nBecause Code-Folding is also very important to many developers and is yet not really integrated.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nEasier Package-Development with Code-Folding\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nNo drawbacks at all\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nAs it only extends the core, there should not be any issues\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14324/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14323","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14323/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14323/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14323/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14323","id":225205563,"number":14323,"title":"Uncaught

https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe div `atom-text-editor .lines` contains many children divs that contain the actual lines of the code being viewed in the editor. Strangely enough, I am seeing funky background colour behaviour here. Here's a screenshot:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1067\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-04-28 at 11 41 32\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/428948/25524047/2e113748-2c09-11e7-901f-e3b456dd30ae.png\">\r\n\r\nSo I went into the dev tools and checked out what is going on. Turns out each of the children divs's background colour only stretches to a bit past the line where the last character of code in that block is:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1083\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-04-28 at 11 49 26\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/428948/25524100/6813db4e-2c09-11e7-8448-11f6036c09bf.png\">\r\n\r\nNow, this is the Seti UI theme and One Dark syntax, but I see it with any combination of ui/syntax themes. Here is the same issue, but in Safe Mode:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"909\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-04-28 at 11 58 46\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/428948/25524246/1e7ffd36-2c0a-11e7-8007-20d95d80a133.png\">\r\n\r\nNow, here's the interesting part - I have tracked down where this actually happens. The culprit is this CSS rule that overwrites the background for each of those containers of code lines:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1203\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-04-28 at 12 00 56\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/428948/25524383/a6b4973e-2c0a-11e7-9020-f7950f13b923.png\">\r\n\r\nBefore you say \"@mtimofiiv, this is a theme problem, go ask them about it\", **note that it does happen with all themes** and that **toggling this CSS rule on/off in the dev tools actually fixes the problem**, but only for that one block and only temporarily.\r\n\r\nUnless I am wrong, it seems like a rendering issue.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nI am not sure what I am doing that perhaps others are not. I have a stock install of Atom which is up to date and even in Safe Mode I am seeing this, so it's not a plugin problem as far as I'm aware. I have not modded my config in any crazy way.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nI expect the background colour of the code blocks to not have jagged box edges.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\nSee above\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:**\r\n\r\nAlways.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nHere is the output of `atom --version`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.16.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd `apm --version`:\r\n\r\n```\r\napm  1.16.1\r\nnpm  3.10.5\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.13\r\ngit 2.11.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy OS is macOS Sierra 10.12.3.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14317","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14317/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14317/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14317/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14317","id":225009399,"number":14317,"title":"Can'","user":{"login":"Tectract","id":3859005,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3859005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tectract","html_url":"https://github.com/Tectract","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tectract/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tectract/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tectract/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tectract/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tectract/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tectract/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tectract/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tectract/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tectract/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-04-28T08:10:20Z","updated_at":"2017-04-28T14:00:40Z","closed_at":"2017-04-28T14:00:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\r\n\r\nNotifications appear.

The ```application.json``` file clears every time, even with **\"Restore Previous Windows on Start\"** enabled. I have tried completely wiping and re-installing Atom, choosing a different directory, opening it in safe mode, none of those things have solved the issue.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open Atom\r\n2. Open a repository/directory\r\n3. Close Atom\r\n4. Reboot\r\n5. Yield result of a blank editor **insert sad face**\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** After closing atom, it **should** save my previous project file tree. It doesn't.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Atom opens with a completely blank editor.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100% of the time.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.16.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n```\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI am on the latest version of macOS.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14315/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14314","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14314/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14314/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14314/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14314","id":224857877,"number":14314,"title":"How can i not copy the simbol \"$\" with double click?","user":{"login":"Encr1pt3d","id":7103591,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7103591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Encr1pt3d","html_url":"https://github.com/Encr1pt3d","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Encr1pt3d/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Encr1pt3d/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Encr1pt3d/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Encr1pt3d/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Encr1pt3d/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Encr1pt3d/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Encr1pt3d/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Encr1pt3d/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Encr1pt3d/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-04-27T17:31:30Z","updated_at":"2017-04-27T17:44:42Z","closed_at":"2017-04-27T17:43:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nwhen I used sublime and I doubled clic in a register in PHP the simbol \"$\" wasn't copied, how can I do that?\r\n\r\nThank you so much","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14314/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14313","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14313/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14313/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14313/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14313","id":224726682,"number":14313,"title":"Add snap install instructions","user":{"login":"flexiondotorg","id":304639,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/304639?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flexiondotorg","html_url":"https://github.com/flexiondotorg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flexiondotorg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flexiondotorg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flexiondotorg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flexiondotorg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flexiondotorg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flexiondotorg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flexiondotorg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flexiondotorg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flexiondotorg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-04-27T09:34:47Z","updated_at":"2017-04-27T15:45:41Z","closed_at":"2017-04-27T15:45:41Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/14313","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14313","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14313.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14313.patch"},"body":"Atom is now published in the Snap store, this pull request add instructions for installing the snap.

Description of the Change\r\n\r\nThis PR implements `Tooltip#recalculatePosition` which resets the Tooltip's position based on its current size. It also adds a `MutationObserver` that watches for the tooltip to change and calls the aforementioned method on the next animation frame when it does.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\n`ResizeObserver` is not available until Electron 1.6 (with a flag), so a `MutationObserver` covers the majority of the important use cases until then.\r\n\r\nI originally implemented this so the resizing operation took place in an `atom.views.pollDocument` call, but this made the tooltip feel very jerky, so I put it in an rAF instead. Happy to hear other 💭 s.\r\n\r\n/cc @nathansobo ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14309/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14308","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14308/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14308/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14308/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14308","id":224587996,"number":14308,"title":"Uncaught exception when trying to open devtools in atom-html-preview","user":{"login":"codekip","id":10675695,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10675695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekip","html_url":"https://github.com/codekip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekip/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-04-26T20:22:18Z","updated_at":"2017-04-26T20:30:07Z","closed_at":"2017-04-26T20:30:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\r\n\r\nError when trying to open devtools in atom-html-preview\r\n\r\n**Atom**: 1.16.0 ia32\r\n**Electron**: 1.3.13\r\n**OS**: Microsoft Windows 10 Pro\r\n**Thrown From**: [atom-html-preview](https://github.com/webBoxio/atom-html-preview) package 0.1.22\r\n\r\n\r\n### Stack Trace\r\n\r\nUncaught Error: Cannot call openDevTools because the webContents is unavailable.

Tried safe-mode, and was able to reproduce this issue. Tried to clear saved state, and while that did solve the issue temporarily, it did come back. I only have two log files that I am working through, both are about 800kbs and 20k lines (not sure if loc is proper term here).\r\n\r\nI have checked for updates after clearing saved state, and it states that 1.16.0 is the latest. Tried to install package-cop, but atom crashed before I even got to that.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Load atom (various conditions: safe mode, clear saved state, etc)\r\n2. Wait or load log files.\r\n3. Wait for Microsoft to say that it is not responding\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Smooth operation and scrolling through the log files\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Scrolling stops at some point, and atom crashes\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nYou can get this information from copy and pasting the output of `atom --version` and `apm --version` from the command line.

I wanted to kick a little feature request your way, if it's not too much trouble. I've noticed that in the beta build of Atom, reopening a project in a window with a preexisting tab gives one the option to discard Atom's autosaved project state. I was wondering if it wouldn't be more consistent with the \"Restore Previous Windows on Start\" setting if, when \"restore windows\" was flagged `false`, opening any project---from the menu, via drag-and-drop, from the CLI, from a project management package---automatically dropped its state on the floor.\r\n\r\nI'm ultimately trying to get back to a world like the one I enjoyed when setting `hot_exit` to `false` in Sublime Text, wherein projects never remember expanded directories or opened tabs. (Unsaved buffers are another story: losing those was a part of the deal with Sublime, but Atom's behavior could in theory be gentler there.) Nineish times out of ten, rather than dropping me helpfully where I was working six minutes ago, the state restoration drops me annoyingly where I was working six weeks ago; it's easier just to get back to where I was on my own.\r\n\r\nThe behavior is _so close_ to what I'm looking for in `1.17.0-beta3`, _except_ that reopening a project in a clean window always restores its tabs (which focus themselves in the Tree View as I close them, ack):\r\n\r\n![screenflow](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2207980/25434235/84b25d5e-2a59-11e7-9d2e-4a45d685fadc.gif)\r\n\r\nCan't imagine this being super-high-priority by any stretch, but I also don't quite have the Atom-fu to tackle it on my own. Would be grateful if someone looking for an easy PR would consider it. :pray:\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Open a whole mess'a tabs in an Atom project window.\r\n2.

Here\\`s the only place in the whole Atom codebase where addToLastWindow value is actually used.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nThis is a bugfix.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nRestoration
