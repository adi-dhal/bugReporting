I experience this behavior:\n\nI start typing and type until I hit the end of my (horizontal) screen space. Now, with the next keystroke, the line should wrap. But instead, I get a horizontal scroll bar and the text editor scrolls to the right as I type, for about 1-2 characters. After that, the line wraps, the editor scrolls all the way back to the left.\n\nI suspect what's happening here is that the text pane does not take into account the space taken up by the horizontal scroll bar and extends 'behind' it. Below you can find a screen shot. The words are 'of' and 'close', so they just fit behind that scroll bar..\n\n![2015-05-27-133332_1920x1200_scrot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/442687/7834953/2eb17a5e-0475-11e5-8266-4b305d57c05a.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6966","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6966/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6966/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6966/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6966","id":81342973,"number":6966,"title":"After

This means that packages like [script](https://github.com/rgbkrk/atom-script) and [hydrogen](https://github.com/willwhitney/hydrogen) have to tell the user to launch Atom from the command line. Some packages (like hydrogen) can't even be installed without the PATH because their dependencies use native extensions built with [`node-gyp`](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp). There exist tools such as [`fix-path`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/fix-path), but they clobber the user's PATH even if they've set something on purpose (with e.g. a virtualenv).\n\nHaving access to the user's PATH will become more and more important as people build packages that interface more deeply with languages, other tools, and the user's environment. Forcing the user to configure each package with complete paths to the binaries it needs is possible, but inelegant, and becomes intractable with general-purpose tools.\n\nThis seems like a clear situation where making this change to Atom itself would dramatically simplify life for many packages and eliminate many bugs arising from poor attempts to capture the PATH.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6956/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4858","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"C3C6:366F:BF601D:1750550:59D92B6D","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=295>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=293>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"b85cacf346858b7bb09872d046b9a4e6\"","status":"200 OK"}}
