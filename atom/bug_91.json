AppImages are a cross-distribution (but very much Linux-specific, in case you're wondering whether they'd run on FreeBSD) package format that are essentially self-mounting disk images with all the required libraries and executables inside to run the app they provide (in the case of an Atom AppImage this would be Atom, of course). They are similar, in this regard, to `.dmg` (or disk image) files for macOS. I realize this project already provides tarball builds for Atom, but AppImages do not need to be extracted in order to be run, unlike tarball builds. AppImages are extremely easy to build, including from your Travis CI artefacts. \r\n\r\nAnd yes, I know that AppImages have been previously discussed in this bugtracker, see for example atom/atom#4980. But I would like to make a formal and specific request (as opposed to issue 4980, which merely requested a portable package format for Linux and did not specifically request an AppImage) for them to be provided. \r\n\r\nThanks for your time,\r\nBrenton

work \r\n\r\n```\r\nobserver = new MutationObserver (mutations) ->\r\n  for mutation in mutations\r\n    stocb = ->\r\n      match = edview.shadowRoot.querySelector(\"my-special-class\")\r\n      if

Prerequisites\n- [ ] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n  No clue. Not going to try. Have had enough weird problems today with Atom.\n- [ ] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n  Yes.\n- [ ] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n  Yes.\n- [ ] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n  Yes.\n- [ ] Are you reporting to the [correct repository] \n  Yes.\n  (https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [ ] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues? \n  Yes. None to be found.\n  q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n\nFor more information on how to write a good [bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) or [enhancement request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\n[Description of the bug or feature]\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. [First Step]\n2. [Second Step]\n3. [and so on...]\n\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]\nI expected to get a full docs build. \n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\nMy index.html file was empty so that when I pushed to Github, I got a 404 error for my gh-pages. I was building all week with this, but now I can't make a complete build, and so I can't make use of gh-pages for my project. That's a problem. It's been screwy all day. It seems that Atom and Github have not fully recovered from last Friday!\n### Versions\n\n1.11.2\n\nYou can get this information from executing `atom --version` and `apm --version` at the command line. Also, please include the OS and what version of the OS you're running.\nI'm on MacOS 10.11.6\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13109","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13109/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13109/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13109/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13109","id":186158290,"number":13109,"title":"Uncaught Error: Could not call remote function 'emit'.

steps:\n- Open a file with a few hundred lines\n- Find a word that's used in many parts of the file\n- cmd-ctrl-g on this word to create a cursor on all the occurrences\n- see that it moves to the last occurrence. **Intended behavior:** shouldn't move\n- scroll all the way up to the first occurrence\n- hit the right arrow\n- see that it moves to the last occurrence. **Intended behavior:** shouldn't move\n\nWhy does it happen?\n\nThe screen movement logic is encoded in the single cursor implementation:\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/blob/0e992326154d387611543f618ad5872dc4665586/src/cursor.coffee#L255-L268\n\nAnd the cursor movement action just delegates to all the cursors:\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/blob/f726dcc81bcd88eb7aff1e61bd77484b875f0854/src/text-editor.coffee#L2153-L2154\n\nSo, what happens is that we're going to iterate over all the cursors, and set the screen position on all of them and the last one is going to win.\n\nInstead, **what should happen** is that if the screen is currently under any of the cursors, don't move. If not, then find the nearest cursor and move to that one, instead of the last one.\n\ncc @nathansobo do you have advice on how I can refactor this piece of code to solve the issue?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13106","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13106/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13106/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13106/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13106","id":186145924,"number":13106,"title":"Go

This caused problems with restoring the session of projects on network mapped drives when upgrading to Atom 1.12.\n\nExample: `\\\\server\\path\\to\\folder` is mapped to `Y:\\`. Atom restores the session with the `Y:\\` path but all new files open with the `\\\\server\\path\\to\\folder` path. So you have to close and reopen all files you previously had opened to not have duplicate files open. This also can cause the UNC path error when running the linter on beta.\n\nI did discover that the `tree-view` still has the old path if you copy the full path of some file and the title bar of Atom also displays the network mapped drive label. So currently we display both of the paths in different parts of Atom.\n##### Atom 1.12.0-beta5 paths\n\n![path stuff](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1058982/19836364/6d5ec3dc-9e9e-11e6-955e-bc29966a3d65.gif)\n##### Atom 1.11.2 paths\n\n![path stuff 1 11](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1058982/19836376/21a003a6-9e9f-11e6-8e65-6519716dfa3c.gif)\n##### Upgrading from 1.11 to 1.12\n\n![path stuff upgrade](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1058982/19836383/6b5bae64-9e9f-11e6-952b-079c82ef0cc0.gif)\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Install Atom 1.11.2\n2. Map a network drive on Windows\n3. Open a folder on the network mapped drive\n4. Open some files for example: `Y:\\file.txt`\n5. Install Atom 1.12-beta5\n6. Paths from previous session restore as `Y:\\file.txt`\n7. Open `Y:\\file.txt` from the `tree-view` a duplicate tab opens as `\\\\server\\path\\to\\folder\\file.txt`\n\n**Expected behavior:** Paths to be consistent across Atom. Upgrade to be smooth so users don't have to close every file after upgrading to avoid opening duplicate files.\n\n**Actual behavior:** Paths are inconsistent. Upgrade from 1.11 to 1.12 not smooth.\n### Versions\n\n```\natom --version\n\nAtom    : 1.12.0-beta5\nElectron: 1.3.6\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\nNode    : 6.3.0\n```\n\n```\napm --version\n\napm  1.12.5\nnpm  3.10.5\nnode 4.4.5\npython 2.7.11\ngit 2.10.1.windows.1\nvisual studio 2015\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13104/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13103","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13103/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13103/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13103/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13103","id":186109178,"number":13103,"title":"NotificationElement dead links","user":{"login":"QwertyZW","id":8478946,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8478946?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/QwertyZW","html_url":"https://github.com/QwertyZW","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QwertyZW/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QwertyZW/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QwertyZW/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QwertyZW/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QwertyZW/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QwertyZW/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QwertyZW/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QwertyZW/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QwertyZW/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-10-30T00:30:22Z","updated_at":"2016-10-30T07:04:15Z","closed_at":"2016-10-30T07:04:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"the {NotificationElement} links referenced in https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/v1.11.2/src/notification-manager.coffee#L10 \nseem to be all dead\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13103/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13102","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13102/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13102/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13102/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13102","id":186103552,"number":13102,"title":"Proposal: Create multiple files over the file dialog","user":{"login":"lenovouser","id":7549136,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7549136?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lenovouser","html_url":"https://github.com/lenovouser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lenovouser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lenovouser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lenovouser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lenovouser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lenovouser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lenovouser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lenovouser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lenovouser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lenovouser/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-10-29T22:03:31Z","updated_at":"2017-01-28T13:10:03Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I'd love to be able to use something similar to the UNIX `touch` or `mkdir` syntax in order to create multiple folders and / or files with the file create dialog.

It allows packages to opt in to fully managing their own transpilation steps, bypassing the built-in Atom transpilation entirely. Here's roughly how it works:\r\n1. A package declares a property in its `package.json` called `atomTranspilers`. This is an array of objects, with each object specifying `glob`, `transpiler`, and optionally `options`.\r\n2. When a package is loaded, if `atomTranspilers` exists in its metadata, we notify the `CompileCache` that it wants to do its own compilation.\r\n3. A new class called `PackageTranspilationRegistry` wraps all the `CompileCache` compilers with a new object of the same interface that falls back to the original compiler if a package hasn't opted in to its own transpilation, but bypasses it completely otherwise.\r\n4. If a package is doing it's own compilation, then for each file that matches the `glob` specified, the associated `transpiler` is required, and the exported value should be an object with a function called `compile` that takes three arguments: `sourceCode`, `filePath`, and `options` (where `options` comes from the package's `package.json`). It should return a string or Buffer with the transpiled source, or `undefined` to indicate that it doesn't want to transpile that file. Note that returning `undefined` doesn't fall back to the legacy, core behavior — packages which opt in to this mechanism are _fully_ responsible for _all_ their transpilation.\r\n\r\nAlso worth noting is that the transpiler file cannot be transpiled itself; its source must run in a vanilla Atom environment (which is admittedly pretty capable these days :).\r\n\r\nOne question I have is how to handle the caching. For example, I currently have `getCachePath` set to\r\n\r\n``` javascript\r\nreturn path.join(\r\n  \"package-transpile\",\r\n  crypto\r\n    .createHash('sha1')\r\n    .update(transpilerSource, 'utf8')\r\n    .update(sourceCode, 'utf8')\r\n    .digest('hex')\r\n  )\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut in many cases it's possible that neither the file's source nor the transpiler's source has changed, but the output of transpilation would be different (e.g. when editing a `.babelrc` file). Perhaps we should allow the package author to also specify a cache key for the file?\r\n\r\n/cc @nathansobo @atom/core for early 💭 \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13101/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13100","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13100/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13100/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13100/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13100","id":186100922,"number":13100,"title":"My icons break when setting Atom to be a default program for files","user":{"login":"OHQSaucey","id":12956465,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12956465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OHQSaucey","html_url":"https://github.com/OHQSaucey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OHQSaucey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OHQSaucey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OHQSaucey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OHQSaucey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OHQSaucey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OHQSaucey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OHQSaucey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OHQSaucey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OHQSaucey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-10-29T21:04:29Z","updated_at":"2016-10-29T21:23:09Z","closed_at":"2016-10-29T21:23:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [ x ] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n- [ x ] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [ x ] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [ x ] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [ x ] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n\nFor more information on how to write a good [bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) or [enhancement request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\nWhen ever I associate Atom to a specific file, for instance a .txt file, the default icon for that file is broken.

[First Step]\n   Open any file in an editor in Atom\n2. [Second Step]\n3. [and so on...]\n\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]\nThe background color of the whole document should stay the same throughout the editing session and regardless of where the cursor is placed.\n\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\nText has a darker background color in squares around the text while areas without text or current line focus appear in a lighter gray color.  It should not be leaving the areas it did not paint text or cursor lines in a different lighter gray color. The background color of the document should be consistent always no matter what editing or how far the text extends. It is extremely distracting to the point of not being useable to have the background color of the text document different where Atom has not painted the screen recently. \n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/98346/19830963/49f81ca8-9dcd-11e6-8ca1-2a7dbc04153f.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/98346/19830966/5e9d12da-9dcd-11e6-9971-fd6e48725f84.png)\n### Versions\n\nYou can get this information from executing `atom --version` and `apm --version` at the command line.
