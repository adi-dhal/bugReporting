Many people change this setting expecting some behavior difference when they start Atom the next time only to find out that it doesn't do anything from what they can tell. This is because Atom's default behavior in the absence of other instructions is to restore the state from the last time Atom was open, completely ignoring this setting.\r\n\r\nThere is [a way to configure Atom to not restore the last state](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11324). The configuration setting was never exposed in the config schema though so people had to dig through the code or search through Issues and PRs to discover that it was an option. This change adds the `core.restorePreviousWindowsOnStart` setting to the schema so that is no longer necessary.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nA more [comprehensive overhaul of Atom's launch story](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10517) whether in one large change or multiple small ones is something that is being looked at but won't realistically solve this confusion in the near term.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nThis isn't new functionality.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nA more clear understanding of what these settings do and do not.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nIf not adding the `core.restorePreviousWindowsOnStart` setting to the config schema was intentional, this has the obvious drawback that it is now showing up in the Settings View.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\n* Applies to #10517\r\n* Fixes #10623\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13152/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13151","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13151/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13151/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13151/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13151","id":187543700,"number":13151,"title":"i uninstalled atom.

The loading gif shows for one or two seconds, then disappears and I have this error message:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/23275730/20031640/ed5a1126-a38b-11e6-9b25-9d5db623540b.png)\r\n\r\nThis is the content of the setup log:\r\n\r\n[SquirrelSetup.pdf](https://github.com/atom/atom/files/573335/SquirrelSetup.pdf)\r\n\r\nI have been downloading Atom from https://atom.io and I am using a Windows 7 32bits.

I've already filed a bug on the package, <https://github.com/jtokoph/auto-detect-indentation/issues/23>, but it occurs to me that a proper fix for this might involve changing Atom core as well, hence this report!\r\n\r\n* [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\r\n* [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\r\n* [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\r\n* [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\r\n* [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe core code which manages per-type editor settings races with third-party code that also tries to manage editor settings. This can lead to surprising / counterintuitive results.\r\n\r\nI ran into this with the `auto-detect-indentation` package, which tries to manage the settings of `softTabs` and `tabLength`. The steps-to-repro below are with respect to that package, and you can refer to the bug I mentioned above for a description of what I'd expect to be the interaction between the core's idea of per-type settings and what the package is trying to achieve.\r\n\r\nI _think_ the problem boils down to the fact that <https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/text-editor-registry.js#L333-L343> often (always?) ends up running _after_ third-party packages are `activate`d (or something along those lines). In addition, it may make sense to distinguish the act of calling `editor.update` as \"action taken by the core\" vs. other reasons. In this case, the package in question might want to behave differently in these different cases. (But please take this all with a big grain of salt, as I'm not super-familiar with the Atom codebase.)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Install the package `auto-detect-indentation`.\r\n2. Put the following in your `config.cson`:\r\n   \r\n   ```\r\n   \".js.source\":\r\n    editor:\r\n      tabLength: 8\r\n      tabType: \"hard\"\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. Open up a `.js` file with blatant two-space indentation.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nThe editor is set to two-space indentation.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\nThe editor is set to eight-space hard tab indentation. If you watch carefully, you can sometimes see the indentation status briefly flash \"2 Spaces\" before getting thwacked to \"Tabs (8 wide)\".\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ atom --version\r\nAtom    : 1.11.2\r\nElectron: 0.37.8\r\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\r\nNode    : 5.10.0\r\n$ apm --version\r\napm  1.12.5\r\nnpm  3.10.5\r\nnode 4.4.5\r\npython 2.7.10\r\ngit 2.3.8\r\n```\r\n\r\nmacOS 10.11.6","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13141/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13140","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13140/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13140/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13140/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13140","id":187213567,"number":13140,"title":"Fix wrong binding on atom-environment.coffee","user":{"login":"vjeux","id":197597,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/197597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjeux","html_url":"https://github.com/vjeux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjeux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjeux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjeux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjeux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjeux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjeux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjeux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjeux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjeux/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-11-03T23:04:20Z","updated_at":"2016-11-04T02:40:37Z","closed_at":"2016-11-04T02:40:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/13140","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13140","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13140.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13140.patch"},"body":"Context: I'm trying to run atom in the browser and have strict mode enabled and it threw on this line.

Not `ISO-88591, cp1252 `is able to encode it properly.\r\n\r\nCross-check that behaviour by doing it vice versa shows me the same.\r\n\r\nI often have read that you claim to say that ANSI is wide-variety of \"encoding\" - yes that is true. But I also read that you claim that `windows1252 `aka `cp1252 `on windows machines ensures such an ANSI encoding.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can reproduce this is wrong. CP1252 is not even ANSI certified and the encoding will differ.\r\n\r\nA file with ANSI encoding from Notepad++ will produce the following charset:\r\n`foo.sql: text/plain;

database scripts or some other usage.\r\n\r\nI would like to ask if there will ever be a timeline when atom editor is able to support proper ANSI encoding - if that will be achieved I can finally move from Notepad++ to atom editor.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13135","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13135/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13135/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13135/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13135","id":186982908,"number":13135,"title":"Windows

Application has auto-update plugin option set to true\r\n2. Plugins are installed automatically as soon as new versions are discovered\r\n3. A notification (like a status message) is displayed in the main UI to indicate upgrade process\r\n4. User can stop auto-update that is performed at the moment if s/he don't like the update\r\n\r\n**Current and suggested behavior**\r\n\r\nConsider Android use case. In first few version users had to agree and take an action on every update. It was the worst update UX I've ever seen. With platform development they decided to add auto-update option for selected applications with option to enable auto-update for all apps. For years now, in Android, applications that don't need new permissions are auto-updated by default.\r\n\r\nThe same problem now has Atom. I have many plugins installed to enhance the editor and increase productivity. However, right now I'm starting my every day at work from updating plugins and then in the evening second time at home. Every day. It would be very beneficial to the users if there were an option to enable auto-update for plugins so they don't need to care about it anymore (as probably most of them don't care right now but they forced to do so).\r\n\r\n**Why would the enhancement be useful to most users**\r\n\r\nYou may perform a user research and ask them if they care about what version of the plugin is currently installed and if they would like to have automatic update. I feel that the most may answer no for the first one and yes to second one. \r\nIt should increase productivity by not being distracted by plugins updates. It also increase confidence that the software installed in plugins directory is always up to date.\r\n\r\n[List some other text editors or applications where this enhancement exists]\r\nNot sure about that. \r\n\r\n**Atom Version:** It's not version related\r\n**OS and Version:** It's not OS related","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13127","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13127/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13127/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13127/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13127","id":186765981,"number":13127,"title":"\"Create issue on the <package> package\" button can create very large URIs.
