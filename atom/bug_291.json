This PR performs this work in a background task for files above a certain size to avoid the pause, indicating progress with a progress bar. To integrate smoothly with existing packages, we open a `TextEditorLoader` item to display progress until the editor is fully loaded, then replace it with the editor afterward. This ensures that no packages attempt to interact with an editor in a partially loaded state.\n## Remaining Issues\n### Can't change grammars\n\nWe currently use tokenized lines to store horizontal spatial information such as hard tabs, paired unicode characters, soft-wrap indents, etc. This is in addition to their primary purpose of representing syntactic scopes. This entanglement makes it awkward to change the grammar once the file is loaded, because doing so replaces all the tokenized lines with the same placeholder lines we're constructing in the background to clear all the styling, then starts tokenizing again from the beginning. However, this takes a lot of time for a large file. Once the editor is loaded, I don't want to put it back in \"background loading\" mode because that implies a lot of complexity. Ideally I'd like to store the horizontal spatial information outside of the tokenized lines, so styling could be cleared without throwing away all this computation.\n### Can't change tab length, invisibles, etc\n\nAgain, these require recomputing the tokenized lines from scratch. Invisibles can be dealt with by separating them out into a second rendering phase once our position calculation is more decoupled from the content of the model. Tab lengths are not so easy. We may be able to use our existing metadata about tab locations to update the lengths more efficiently in a synchronous way (without having to scan every token). Or we may want to just disable the ability to change it over a certain size. Or we may need to bite the bullet and figure out how to put the editor back in \"background loading\" mode after all. I'd like to put that off though.\n### Long pauses before / after progress bar\n\nThe initial pause is due to loading the entire buffer in the background task before beginning processing. I just did this as a first pass implementation and will fix it before merging this. The second pause is autocomplete-plus populating its symbol table. We may want to disable it for now for files above a certain size, then work on optimizing this.\n## Tasks\n- [x] Display progress bar for loading in background\n- [ ] Disallow operations that require recomputation of tokenized lines\n- [ ] Optimize background task by computing results in a streaming fashion\n- [ ] Do something about autocomplete plus\n\nI may want to push tokenization to a background task in a different PR. That would allow us to at least select an initial grammar for large files instead of the null grammar as is currently the case on this PR. But I think loading huge files without highlighting is enough of an improvement to do that in a second pass.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7060/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7059","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7059/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7059/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7059/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7059","id":83902890,"number":7059,"title":"Workspace.open() should support splitting up / down","user":{"login":"walles","id":158201,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/158201?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/walles","html_url":"https://github.com/walles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walles/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118249520,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/api","name":"api","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-06-02T08:07:10Z","updated_at":"2016-02-13T02:21:01Z","closed_at":"2016-02-13T02:21:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The docs here...\nhttps://atom.io/docs/api/v0.204.0/Workspace#instance-open\n... says that `Workspace.open` supports the `split` option with arguments `left` or `right`.\n\nIn addition to this, I would like `Workspace.open` to support splitting `up` and `down` as well.\n\nNeeded by the Markdown preview pane for example:\nhttps://github.com/atom/markdown-preview/issues/99\n\nRegards /Johan\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7059/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7058","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7058/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7058/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7058/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7058","id":83892145,"number":7058,"title":"Atom is trying to add a new helper tool?","user":{"login":"sebhoss","id":44168,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/44168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebhoss","html_url":"https://github.com/sebhoss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebhoss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebhoss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebhoss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebhoss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebhoss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebhoss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebhoss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebhoss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebhoss/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98445015,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/mac","name":"mac","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":175213356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/question","name":"question","color":"ededed","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":14,"created_at":"2015-06-02T07:41:52Z","updated_at":"2017-07-03T13:38:53Z","closed_at":"2015-06-03T12:48:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"hey there,\n\neverytime i open atom, i'm asked to enter my password in order to let atom install a new helper tool.

What happens?\n\n[Some users find the **default** keybinding to toggle bookmarks **isn't working**](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3930), probably due to conflicts with the keyboard bindings of Intel Graphics (installed as a driver), which is **very common for Windows users**.\n\nEven when that `ctrl-alt-f2` does work, I feel it **really hard to hit**, either with one (left) hand of mine or with both.\n## My solution\n\nSo far, none of the packages in my Atom occupies the key `f1`.\n\nHence, I added a line into my \"keymap.cson\":\n\n```\n'f1': 'bookmarks:toggle-bookmark'\n```\n\nI am happy.\n## What to survey\n\nI wonder:\n1. If `ctrl-alt-f2` works for you, do you feel it easy enough to hit?\n2.
