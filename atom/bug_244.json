config.get method does not return the default values for objects with properties in a config schema.\n### Example\n\nFor example the editor config has:\n(excerpt taken from [config-schema.coffee](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/config-schema.coffee))\n\n``` coffeescript\n...\n  backUpBeforeSaving:\n    type: 'boolean'\n    default: false\n    description: 'Ensure file contents aren\\'t lost if there is an I/O error during save by making a temporary backup copy.'\n  invisibles:\n    type: 'object'\n    properties:\n      eol:\n        type: ['boolean', 'string']\n        default: '\\u00ac'\n        maximumLength: 1\n      space:\n        type: ['boolean', 'string']\n        default: '\\u00b7'\n        maximumLength: 1\n      tab:\n        type: ['boolean', 'string']\n        default: '\\u00bb'\n        maximumLength: 1\n      cr:\n        type: ['boolean', 'string']\n        default: '\\u00a4'\n        maximumLength: 1\n...\n```\n\nA call to `atom.config.get('editor')` returns an object with an 'invisibles' value that is an empty object. We are expecting an object containing the default values for the properties in 'invisibles'. \n\nThis result is caused by `_.defaults()` in `@getRawValue()` not being recursive. The lack of a `_.deepDefaults()` lead me to use a bit of a workaround with `_.deepExtends()`. Now with `_.deepExtends()`, the default values are the base while any new values read from the config.cson overwrite the defaults. This way all default values, even nested ones, appear in the result.\n### Side-Effect\n\nA side effect of this issue was that atom/settings-view does not properly present the available configuration options from the config schema. The `appendObject()` method in [settings-view/lib/settings-panel.coffee](https://github.com/atom/settings-view/blob/5a115f9e051da32e7af676daf6076d890d8d5e75/lib/settings-panel.coffee) uses the values provided by `config.get(packageName)`. The lack of keys in the value provided to appendObject would lead to objects in the schema disappearing from the SettingsPanel. With this proposed change, the SettingsPanel now properly displays objects and their properties.\n\nSee atom/settings-view#386 and atom/settings-view#518.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8479","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8479/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8479/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8479/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8479","id":102567527,"number":8479,"title":"Keyboard input from the numeric keypad","user":{"login":"i5ar","id":5305723,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5305723?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/i5ar","html_url":"https://github.com/i5ar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i5ar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i5ar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i5ar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i5ar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i5ar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i5ar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i5ar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i5ar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i5ar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-08-22T21:10:33Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T21:08:50Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T21:08:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Some European keyboards don't have _Grave Accent_ and _Tilde_ characters.

incompatible when it has a build failure.\n\nIt also changes the storage location of the cached incompatible native modules in local storage so we can distinguish them more easily from build failures, so we should wait to merge this until the Electron upgrade lands which will force us to invalidate the cache
