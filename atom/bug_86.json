Unfortunately, electron doesn't have APIs for that.\r\n\r\nThings I have tried:\r\n1) Electron has `browserWindow.webContents.invalidate()` and `.on('paint' -> ...)` but it only works with offscreen rendering which     atom doesn't use.\r\n2) `.capturePage(-> ...)` takes a screenshot of the page and I hoped it     would do a flush first but it inconsistently displays the highlight     so it won't work.\r\n3) `Using setTimeout((-> ...), 16)` works many times but not always\r\n4) `requestAnimationFrame(-> ...)` should be what we want but unfortunately     it doesn't always show the highlights :(\r\n\r\nWhat I found worked was to nest three `requestAnimationFrame`, it works all the time even when my machine is busy. This is not a 100% solution but I think that it's okay to assume that if the highlight hasn't been updated in three frames then you should probably try and optimize your code. 3 frames is 50ms and that delay isn't noticeable.\r\n\r\nNote: the proper way to solve this that was mentioned in the issue is to open the menu from the main process but this is already what atom does and it's still an issue.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![](http://g.recordit.co/DruDVLJoN9.gif)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![](http://g.recordit.co/PxBnwNt5yy.gif)\r\n\r\nReleased under CC0","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13265","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13265/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13265/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13265/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13265","id":190326262,"number":13265,"title":"Scrollbars move to the top of the file when splitting panes or closing split panes","user":{"login":"skywind3000","id":3035071,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3035071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skywind3000","html_url":"https://github.com/skywind3000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skywind3000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skywind3000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skywind3000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skywind3000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skywind3000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skywind3000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skywind3000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skywind3000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skywind3000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":505038679,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false},{"id":62363277,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2016-11-18T14:03:11Z","updated_at":"2017-05-19T11:38:22Z","closed_at":"2017-05-19T11:38:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\r\n* [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\r\n* [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\r\n* [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\r\n* [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\r\n* [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\r\n\r\nFor more information on how to write a good [bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) or [enhancement request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- When I open a large file and move the cursor to the bottom, and then click View->Panes->Split Right.\r\nI found the scroll bar position of previous pane rewind to the top but the cursor is still on the last line.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

The two biggest offenders in this regard are jQuery (which is required by `atom-space-pen-views`) and HTML custom elements. The issues with jQuery *could* be addressed by patching jQuery to not do feature detection, but considering that we want to remove it anyway over the long term and it causes other performance and complexity problems, it's probably cleaner to just remove jQuery completely. Custom elements were a failed experiment and we aren't actually getting value out of registering them with the DOM global.

The bottom line is that it would require a change in Electron, hence why I chose Medium/Hard as the difficulty. It might be worth exploring solutions with the Electron team as well as talking to the Node team, understanding if there are plans to improve this in the future.\r\n\r\n  An interesting observation is that most of it is spent in requiring modules, so maybe Electron/Node could employ some of the techniques we plan to use for userland requires (see below).\r\n\r\n* Requiring modules.<br>**Cost:** ~ 350-400 ms.<br>**Savings:** 90-100%.<br>**Difficulty:** Medium/Hard.\r\n\r\n  This sections concerns the time spent in searching, compiling and executing JavaScript files. I haven't provided a screenshot of the CPU profile because this cost is spread across many function calls.\r\n\r\n  So long as modules don't access Node core modules or DOM APIs at require-time, we should be able to use v8 snapshots to do most of the work during `script/build`. This means we would need to restructure some packages to stop using those APIs, but it should be doable. Last week we have been working on proving the feasibility of this approach and it seems like we could apply it to Atom.\r\n\r\n* Constructing `AtomEnvironment`.<br>**Cost:** ~ 100-110ms.<br>**Savings:** 75-80%.<br>**Difficulty:** Medium.\r\n\r\n  ![screen shot 2016-11-17 at 14 08 52](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/20390488/6c9aceca-accf-11e6-8630-5da169a2a984.png)\r\n\r\n  The above chart breaks down into several sub-tasks. Some of them can be executed upfront in the snapshotting phase:\r\n    * Creating objects like `Workspace`, `TextEditorRegistry`, etc.(~ 10ms).\r\n    * `Config.setSchema` (~ 7ms).\r\n    * `ThemeManager.loadBaseStylesheets` (~ 19ms).\r\n    * `KeymapManager.loadBundledKeymaps` (~ 11ms)\r\n\r\n  Others need to happen at runtime, although we can make them asynchronous and avoid blocking the main thread:\r\n    * `ApplicationDelegate.disableZoom` (~ 9ms).\r\n    * `AtomEnvironment.registerDefaultCommands` (~ 7ms).\r\n    * `AtomEnvironment.installWindowEventHandler` (~ 7ms).\r\n    * `HistoryManager.loadState` (~ 25ms).\r\n    * `Config.loadUserConfig` (~ 5ms).\r\n\r\n* Loading Packages.<br>**Cost:** ~ 50-60ms.<br>**Savings:** 90-100%.<br>**Difficulty:** Medium.\r\n\r\n  ![screen shot 2016-11-17 at 13 15 15](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/20390867/f4c94866-acd0-11e6-8626-bff3f7d54513.png)\r\n\r\n  Loading packages involves reading their style sheets and their configuration schemas. The image above is the typical chart of a single `Package.load` call. At least for bundled packages, we have all the information at compile-time and we should be able to bake it into the snapshot.\r\n\r\n* Environment Deserialization.<br>**Cost:** ~ 50-60ms.<br>**Savings:** 70%.<br>**Difficulty:** N/A.\r\n\r\n  ![screen shot 2016-11-17 at 13 16 21](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/20391116/463b8d7a-acd2-11e6-9e05-4077e194acb9.png)\r\n\r\n  Deserializing the environment is something that needs to happen at runtime but, as the chart above shows, the dominator in that stack trace is `GitRepository`. In particular, it might be worth revisiting `openSubmodules` and `refreshStatus`: the former can probably be deferred at a later moment in time, while the latter is already asynchronous and is probably slow because of the overhead of creating a `Task`.\r\n\r\n* Activating Packages.<br>**Cost:** ~ 300ms.<br>**Savings:** N/A<br>**Difficulty:** Medium/Hard.\r\n\r\n  ![screen shot 2016-11-17 at 14 39 47](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/20391597/6a1adc30-acd4-11e6-93bf-aa929f773678.png)\r\n\r\n  Estimating savings for this section is somewhat tricky, as a considerable amount of time is spent in requiring modules (which has been accounted for in a previous section). However, we think we could further reduce the cost of it by splitting core packages activation into two phases (snapshot and runtime), offloading as much work as possible to the snapshot one.\r\n\r\n* Refreshing less cache and reloading base style sheets.<br>**Cost:** ~ 20ms.<br>**Savings:** 90-100%<br>**Difficulty:** N/A.\r\n\r\n  ![screen shot 2016-11-17 at 14 55 48](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/20391951/04a732c0-acd6-11e6-9e21-41c2bd840d7c.png)\r\n\r\n  The first thing that is suspicious is that this stack trace feels redundant, as we do a similar thing when instantiating `AtomEnvironment`. Anyways, this is all information we have at compile time, so the only cost we should pay at runtime is to add the proper CSS to the `<head>` element.\r\n\r\n* First Layout<br>**Cost:** ~ 250ms.<br>**Savings:** N/A<br>**Difficulty:** Hard.\r\n\r\n  ![screen shot 2016-11-17 at 14 59 03](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/20392134/c837d6e0-acd6-11e6-8404-97abc06feaf1.png)\r\n\r\n  This is the first layout that Atom performs after loading and it takes a pretty huge amount of time. Unfortunately, we cannot inspect what is happening under the hood that causes this layout to be slow. We suspect it might be due to our use of flexbox, but at the same time we feel like it might be worth capturing a native profile of Electron and inspecting the actual native calls that are being executed.\r\n\r\n* Main Process.<br>**Cost:** ~ 600ms.<br>**Savings:** N/A<br>**Difficulty:** N/A.\r\n\r\n  Profiling the main process is somewhat trickier than profiling the renderer process, as we don't have direct access to the dev tools. However, I have estimated that we spend `~ 600ms` to get from the first line of code in the main process to the first line of code in the renderer process. This section probably deserves an entire issue, as we are aware that the main process needs a overhaul. However it's worth noting that it significantly contributes to startup time, although it's unclear how much of it is Atom's fault and how much of it is due to Electron.\r\n\r\n/cc: @atom/maintainers ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13253/reactions","total_count":78,"+1":32,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":13,"confused":0,"heart":33}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13252","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13252/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13252/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13252/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13252","id":189995501,"number":13252,"title":"[FIXED] Atom appears to open past monitor.
