I'm almost sure that it used to work.  Other native mac apps respect the shift key to reverse cycle direction.

Atom's behavior breaks what is for me a very basic, very common practice and I think I can provide test cases which spell out the problem pretty clearly.\n\nI know that to duplicate a selection of lines I can type shift-cmd-D, and that's OK - I've learned to do it and I use it.  But I shouldn't need that command, because there is a technique I practice in every other text editor which does not require learning anything new.  That is Copy-Paste-Paste.  That is:\nselect entire lines of text (with triple-click-drag or cmd-left, shift-down, shift-down)\n1. copy (do not change the selection at this point)\n2. paste (pastes content in place, leaving selection at the start of the next line)\n3. paste again (pastes a copy after the original, indented identically to the original)\n\nOr, in shorthand, cmd-CVV.  In my experience, this is a universally successful way of accomplishing a frequently useful operation, except for atom.  Here's what goes wrong when I try it with atom.\n\nIn step 2, instead of pasting the content in place, it outdents the selection to the left margin.  In step 2, instead of pasting the second copy indented identically, it indents it by the indentation of the final line of the block.  That is, if the final line was indented 8 spaces more than the first line, it indents my second pasted block by 8 spaces.  If I paste again, it adds yet another level of indentation.\n\nThis is something I do under many circumstances, but probably the most common are to add a new \"case\" block to a switch statement or to duplicate a small function.\n\nI'm sure this behavior is the result of enabling some other, desirable, behavior, but this is not behavior I would want or can imagine wanting under any circumstances.  When I copy-paste in place, I do not believe the pasted code should have changed in any way.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12221/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12220","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12220/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12220/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12220/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12220","id":167172145,"number":12220,"title":"Atom Beta gets stuck in auto-update loop.","user":{"login":"dengeist","id":13525251,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13525251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengeist","html_url":"https://github.com/dengeist","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengeist/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengeist/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengeist/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengeist/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengeist/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengeist/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengeist/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengeist/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengeist/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-07-23T07:12:07Z","updated_at":"2016-07-23T17:04:01Z","closed_at":"2016-07-23T17:04:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\n\nAtom 1.9.0-beta1 gets stuck in a restart-to-install loop.
