This is somewhat a downside of using an interpreted language: everything from loading files into memory to executing them must happen at runtime.\n\nWith snapshotting, however, we're allowed to take a snapshot of the heap and make it available to the V8 context without actually running any code at runtime. Indeed, we can exploit this to load files during our build pipeline (i.e. `script/build`) and simply refer to the already required modules when Atom is executed.\n\nWe _think_ this could bring a decent speedup in our startup phase, which on my machine currently takes `1.0s`-`1.2s`.\n### How does snapshotting works?\n\nElectron provides a `mksnapshot` utility that allows to take a javascript file and turn it into a blob ready to be loaded in memory. After generating it, loading it is just a matter of copying it inside the Electron.framework directory:\n\n``` bash\n$ cp snapshot_blob.bin /Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Frameworks/Electron\\ Framework.framework/Resources/snapshot_blob.bin\n```\n\nThe capabilities that the _snapshot phase_ provides, though, are somewhat limited. Unfortunately, we won't have access to many of the handy facilities that we're allowed to use in a normal Electron application. For example:\n1. Node;\n2. Functions such as `Object::toString` (or anything else defined in v8 `js_natives`);\n3. Native modules;\n\nThis means we have to change many (here I should say \"most\") of our files to be arranged in order to overcome the above limitations (e.g. by deferring `require`s of native modules).\n### What's currently in this PR\n\nI have managed to load the entire `text-buffer` library and to use it within Atom. I plan to go on with other expensive require paths, such as `src/project` and `src/config`.\n\nI am still a bit unsure on how to proceed exactly, but before automating the generation of `snapshot.js`, I'd prefer to carefully include source files so that I can patch external libraries without actually opening PRs on the other repos. This is because I'd like to understand what are the realistic savings that this technique could allow us before delving into all the other details that concern building, etc.\n### What's missing\n\nHere I'll include what this PR would need in order to be :ship:ped. I do not expect to follow any of this point in a particular order, but they will serve as a good TODO list (also in case anyone wants to help out with this).\n- [ ] Generate `snapshot.js` automatically. (right now I have manually included the source files)\n- [ ] Change all the core source files so that they can be required in the snapshot.\n- [ ] Change all the libraries source files so that they can be required in the snapshot.\n- [ ] Include benchmarks to demonstrate the potential of snapshotting.\n- [ ] Investigate how debugging changes when having functions already loaded in memory. (can we use source maps here somehow?)\n\nAny kind of feedback here would be super appreciated.

1.0.19\nUbuntu 14.04.2 LTS\n\nThe file buffer autoloading fails to load changes from `git stash pop`s on files that didn't exist in the previous branch you were on.  That's kind of a confusing sentence so I'll elaborate.  In this repo https://github.com/acb/Atom-Test there is a branch `master` with the file `master.txt` in it.  There is also a branch `dev` that has a file `dev.txt` in it that does not exist in `master`.\n\nNow perform the following steps (leaving `dev.txt` open in Atom the entire time):\n1. `git checkout dev`\n2. Alter `dev.txt` in some way\n3. `git stash` -- changes in `dev.txt` are stashed and the buffer in Atom changes appropriately\n4. `git checkout master`\n5. `git checkout dev`\n6. `git stash pop` -- changes in `dev.txt` are `pop`ped to disk, but the buffer in Atom **does not** update\n\nNo errors are shown in the console.\n\nIf this goes undected by the user they could accidentally save `dev.txt` and blow away their stashed changes without any warning.  The solution as of now is to close the file (and DON'T SAVE CHANGES when prompted) and reopen.  In Sublime Text in this situation you get a prompt stating that the file changed on disk and asking you if you would like to reload.\n\nAttached is a gif of the behavior.  Please let me know if I can provide any more information, and feel free to use the repo linked above for any testing you may need.\n\n![atom-bug](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4690898/10678022/bcda2682-78dd-11e5-830e-c29b223c1763.gif)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9257/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9256","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9256/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9256/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9256/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9256","id":112847010,"number":9256,"title":"Search and duplicate results with symbolic links","user":{"login":"MichaelJCole","id":1504790,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1504790?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelJCole","html_url":"https://github.com/MichaelJCole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelJCole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelJCole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelJCole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelJCole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelJCole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelJCole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelJCole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelJCole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelJCole/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":175213356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/question","name":"question","color":"ededed","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-10-22T16:59:41Z","updated_at":"2015-10-27T16:06:50Z","closed_at":"2015-10-27T16:06:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, I have a project split into microservices.

They are all from the same file, with the same text, on the same line.\n\nIf there was one last filter the results passed through, that checked if they'd already been added to the list, that would be awesome.\n\nIs this possible with a package?  Is there an existing package to hack?   \n\nThanks!\n\nMike\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9255","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9255/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9255/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9255/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9255","id":112818882,"number":9255,"title":"Uncaught
