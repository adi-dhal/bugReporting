`macOS`.\r\n\r\nHere are the captured screenshots where in safe mode:\r\n\r\nWhen not in full screen

Prepare `macOS` environment. 🤑 \r\n1. Open Atom.\r\n2. Go to `Settings` and change `Title Bar` option to `custom` or `custom-inset` from `Core` setting.\r\n3. Toggle fullscreen by `ctrl` + `cmd` + `f`.\r\n4. Reload editor by `ctrl` + `alt` + `cmd` + `l`.\r\n5. Hang tight until editor titlebar show up\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Titlebar hidden when reloading editor.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Titlebar keep showing even in fullscreen mode.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Every time you follow above steps.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.18.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.15\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n`macOS Sierra 10.12.5`\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14798","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14798/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14798/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14798/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14798","id":236380301,"number":14798,"title":"GitHub package doesn't load environment variables on commit","user":{"login":"piuccio","id":680284,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/680284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piuccio","html_url":"https://github.com/piuccio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piuccio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piuccio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piuccio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piuccio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piuccio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piuccio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piuccio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piuccio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piuccio/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-06-16T04:58:50Z","updated_at":"2017-06-16T15:25:54Z","closed_at":"2017-06-16T15:25:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI've just updated Atom and tried to commit from the new GitHub/Git package but I get the error\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Failed to replace env in config: ${BINTRAY_TOKEN}\r\n    at /usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/lib/config/core.js:418:13\r\n    at RegExp.[Symbol.replace] (native)\r\n    at String.replace (native)\r\n    at envReplace (/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/lib/config/core.js:414:12)\r\n    at parseField (/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/lib/config/core.js:392:7)\r\n    at /usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/lib/config/core.js:335:17\r\n    at Array.forEach (native)\r\n    at Conf.add (/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/lib/config/core.js:334:23)\r\n    at ConfigChain.addString (/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/config-chain/index.js:244:8)\r\n    at Conf.

I've noticed that the delay is generally longer the bigger the selected file is.\r\n\r\n[Here's quick gif about what I'm talking about.](https://i.imgur.com/w3qXcu2.gifv) Notice how the cursor in the first clip (opened in a plain folder) immediately pops up upon focusing the window, while the cursor in the second clip (opened in the Git repo) has a slight delay before the cursor pops up.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, when doing this same thing in the Chrome tools timeline, you see the big red section in which the frame freezes:\r\n\r\n![atom-timeline](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6778537/27199642-6123b7ac-51dc-11e7-8a98-9eedeb9c2f47.png)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Start up Atom\r\n2. Open up a folder that is a Git repo\r\n3. Open any file in the repo\r\n4. Click somewhere outside the Atom window (therefore deselecting it)\r\n5. Click back onto the editor (will freeze for a few seconds)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Editor doesn't freeze\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Editor freezes for a few seconds\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Every single time I deselect the Window and reselect. **This also sometimes occurs when opening up a new file within the Git repo.**\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n```\r\n> atom --version\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.18.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.15\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\n>apm --version\r\n\r\napm  1.18.1\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.13\r\ngit 2.12.0.windows.1\r\nvisual studio 2015\r\n```\r\nI'm on Windows 10 Version 1703 (OS Build 15063.413)\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nWhen I first installed Atom, I didn't have this issue.

developer mode in any way results in an exception being thrown, whether using --dev from the command line or using \"Open in Dev Mode..\" from the menu.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nI expect the editor to open in development mode, as it had in previous versions.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\nAn exception is thrown and displayed in the Atom console, resulting in Atom failing to initialize.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:**\r\n\r\n100%, every single time Atom is launched in dev mode.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom: 1.18.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.15\r\nChrome: 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode : 6.5.0\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nHere is the exception output on the Atom console:\r\n```\r\nDownload the React DevTools and use an HTTP server (instead of a file: URL) for a better

Description\r\n\r\nWhen typing a bunch of text and then immediately pasting something, atom will consider the whole text as an \"action\" in the undo system. If you decide that you pasted the clipboard in the wrong location and undo it, it will not only delete the pasted text, but a few words you've typed before.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. have some text in your clipboard\r\n2. type `abc abc abc = `\r\n3. immediately hit cmd-v / ctrl-v\r\n4. hit cmd-z / ctrl-z\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nEditor should contain `abc abc abc = `\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\nIn this example, my editor contained `abc abc ab ` (notice the space behind `ab` which wasn't there before either). This mainly varies by how fast you type and maybe also by the length of the clipboard string. Sometimes it deletes a whole word.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** \r\n\r\n90%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom: tested with 1.16.0 and 1.18.0-beta0\r\nElectron: 1.3.15\r\nChrome: 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode: 6.5.0\r\napm  1.18.1\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.13\r\ngit 2.11.0","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14785/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14784","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14784/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14784/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14784/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14784","id":236084061,"number":14784,"title":"Color emoji not displaying","user":{"login":"soleera","id":25336289,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/25336289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soleera","html_url":"https://github.com/soleera","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soleera/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soleera/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soleera/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soleera/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soleera/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soleera/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soleera/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soleera/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soleera/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-06-15T05:51:08Z","updated_at":"2017-08-14T22:52:56Z","closed_at":"2017-08-14T22:52:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?
