The main problem with the current system is that it gives a higher score to HTML grammar for any file that begins with HTML doctype, but the file might be using PHP or some other (templating) language that utilizes HTML syntax (with a different file type, eg `php`).\n\n@nathansobo suggested adding an option to fall back to using the old system in case the new one breaks something, but I am not sure how to do that exactly. Also another question would be whether this transition period is needed at all, because all it \"breaks\" right now is grammar selection for files, for which there is a known file type, but the first line is matched from some other grammar. A fix for that case would be just adding the file type via user configuration, to override the known type from the other language.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9513/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9512","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9512/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9512/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9512/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9512","id":116179095,"number":9512,"title":"Add 'Install Packages' To Packages Drop Down","user":{"login":"francoislaberge","id":1845,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1845?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/francoislaberge","html_url":"https://github.com/francoislaberge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francoislaberge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francoislaberge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francoislaberge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francoislaberge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francoislaberge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francoislaberge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francoislaberge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francoislaberge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francoislaberge/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true},{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-11-10T19:07:43Z","updated_at":"2016-03-03T19:59:22Z","closed_at":"2016-03-03T19:13:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"For me at least, I expected the top level **Packages** menu to have entry for jumping to installing/managing packages.

Then, as soon as Node is done with IO, it calls us back with the content of those files, at which point we call `ScopedProperties::activate` to transfer those settings into our `Config` instance.\n\nWhen setting a key in our `Config`, we emit an event that notifies attached listeners that something has just changed: the implications of this are pretty important, as there is a remarkable amount of operations we need to do in order to notify those clients, such as comparing the newly set key with the previous one, etc. Although the current implementation could be somewhat improved in terms of performance, it handles the configuration semantics pretty smartly, which means that, whenever setting something in the configuration, it's better to emit as little events as possible. For this reason, before the changes introduced with this PR, we were [wrapping packages activation with a call to `Config::transact`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/46665c1f8b86664f9431d66cfd9e291bdc0689cf/src/package-manager.coffee#L419-L423).\n\nThe problem with this approach, however, is that it doesn't play well with the asynchronous nature of loading the configuration, as the transaction will end as soon as we've finished iterating over the packages to activate (i.e. _before_ `ScopedProperties::activate` has the chance to execute). This means we emit way more events than we really should, paying an extra amount of time during startup:\n\n![before](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/11060723/54d06bae-87a2-11e5-9749-9103bcd74e67.png)\n\nThe breakdown here is the following:\n- Parsing CSON: `~ 39.2ms`\n- Activating Grammars: `~ 71.0ms`\n- Activating Settings: `122.4ms` + `37.9ms`\n- **Total: 294.9ms**\n\nFor this reason, we have introduced a `Config::beginTransaction` and `Config::endTransaction`, which are aimed to handle the asynchronous scenario in a more performant manner:\n\n![after](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/11060724/551a89b4-87a2-11e5-9a4d-43c11afed1a6.png)\n\nWe can observe a a `~ 125ms` speedup, as this approach allows us to emit just a minimal amount of events, thereby dramatically reducing the overhead of loading setting files.\n\nFor the future, I think it's also worth taking a look at how we might improve CSON (which, for bundled packages, is actually JSON) parsing and grammars activation, in order to reduce those remaining `169.7ms` to the minimum.\n\n/cc: @atom/feedback @nathansobo @maxbrunsfeld\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9508/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9507","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9507/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9507/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9507/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9507","id":116062570,"number":9507,"title":"Use lazy loaded snippets","user":{"login":"as-cii","id":482957,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/482957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii","html_url":"https://github.com/as-cii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-11-10T08:43:47Z","updated_at":"2015-11-10T09:56:34Z","closed_at":"2015-11-10T09:56:31Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/9507","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9507","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9507.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9507.patch"},"body":"Ref.: https://github.com/atom/snippets/pull/182\nRef.: https://github.com/atom/settings-view/pull/694\nRef.: https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-snippets/pull/60\n\nThis PR just bumps snippets, settings-view and autocomplete-snippets, in order to give the snippets lazy load approach a spin on Travis.

and `getBeginningOfPreviousParagraphBufferPosition` in [cursor.coffee](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/cursor.coffee) do not work if the line endings are CRLF. For example, when using vim-mode, paragraph jumping does not work (see atom/vim-mode#911).\n\nI spent a good deal of time trying to fix this problem, but I don't have a good solution. The current regex, `/^\\n*$/g`, does not work as Javascript regex counts CRLF as two line breaks ([source](http://www.regular-expressions.info/anchors.html)), so the regex matches to the second half of a CRLF pair. I experimented with some other regex patterns but have been unable to find one that works.\n\nI also considered getting CRLF/LF information from elsewhere and using that to pick a regex pattern to use. I tried `@editor.buffer.prefferedLineEnding`, but that is unreliable, as it needs to be set explicitly or it is undefined. \n\nAnother option, which I haven't tried implementing, is to simply use the line ending of the current line to pick the regex, however I am not sure if this would be considered acceptable behavior. If this seems reasonable I'd be happy to implement it and PR. If there are other ideas, I'd also be happy to implement them.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9503","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9503/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9503/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9503/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9503","id":115999190,"number":9503,"title":"Atom autoupdate keeping gigabytes of redundant copies of Atom","user":{"login":"Alazoral","id":682772,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/682772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alazoral","html_url":"https://github.com/Alazoral","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alazoral/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alazoral/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alazoral/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alazoral/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alazoral/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alazoral/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alazoral/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alazoral/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alazoral/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-11-10T00:28:38Z","updated_at":"2015-11-17T19:36:35Z","closed_at":"2015-11-17T19:36:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This keeps happening after I leave Atom running for a while:\n![screen shot 2015-11-10 at 11 22 25 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/682772/11050798/5e86af64-879d-11e5-8ffa-6492eafe08fb.png)\nEvery single one of those folders contains an _identical_ v1.10 Atom.app. This is using a significant amount of download quota and totally filling my small SSD - that listing represents almost 9 GB!
