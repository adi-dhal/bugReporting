is a regression. Up to and including Atom v0.188.0, if you had code like:\n\n``` coffee\nsetTimeout(\n  () -> Promise.reject('haha rejected'),\n  0)\n```\n\nyou would discover your error via the following in the console:\n\n```\nUnhandled promise rejection Promise\n     __proto__: Promise\n    [[PromiseStatus]]: \"rejected\"\n    [[PromiseValue]]: \"haha rejected\"\n```\n\nwhich you could use to help debug your issue.\n\nAs of Atom v0.189.0, you see nothing. You can have chains and chains of `Promise.then()`, and if there is a failure in the middle, you now have no idea and have to start adding `.catch()` calls everywhere. It's madness.\n\nI don't know what specifically causes the change, but here's what I have discovered thus far:\n- Atom v0.189.0 (Apr 1) is built on atom-shell v0.22.3 (Mar 29) whereas Atom v0.188.0 (Mar 24) is built on atom-shell v0.21.3 (Mar 3).\n- atom-shell v0.22.0 mentions **Upgrade to Chrome 41** in its release notes.\n- https://github.com/iojs/io.js/pull/758 is a PR with a massive history, which I will not even to pretend to have read, but I believe it was closed on Feb 24 and it includes the following text in its initial comment:\n\n> Implement unhandled rejection tracking for promises as\n> specified in https://gist.github.com/benjamingr/0237932cee84712951a2\n> \n> Fixes https://github.com/iojs/io.js/issues/256\n> \n> Note that I did not implement any default action - so errors are still\n> swallowed by default and many developers are therefore not going\n> to discover the hooks.\n\nSeems suspicious.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6488/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6487","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6487/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6487/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6487/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6487","id":70312756,"number":6487,"title":"Bookmarks removed after jsFormat(https://atom.io/packages/jsformat) formatting  ","user":{"login":"vinaymavi","id":1610828,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1610828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinaymavi","html_url":"https://github.com/vinaymavi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinaymavi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinaymavi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinaymavi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinaymavi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinaymavi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinaymavi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinaymavi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinaymavi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinaymavi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-04-23T05:26:20Z","updated_at":"2015-04-23T15:52:21Z","closed_at":"2015-04-23T15:52:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Bookmarks created successfully with Ctrl+Alt+F2 but I am configured jsFormat on **on save** after formatting Bookmarks removed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6487/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6486","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6486/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6486/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6486/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6486","id":70277099,"number":6486,"title":"Crystal support","user":{"login":"Vikaton","id":9522710,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9522710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikaton","html_url":"https://github.com/Vikaton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikaton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikaton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikaton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikaton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikaton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikaton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikaton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikaton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vikaton/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-04-23T01:33:02Z","updated_at":"2015-04-25T04:32:32Z","closed_at":"2015-04-23T01:39:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"What do you guys think on adding Crystal syntax highlighting support for Atom?\n\nhttp://crystal-lang.org/\n\nMaybe the sublime text lib might help?

Here's how those two deprecations look now in Deprecation Cop:\n\n![screen shot 2015-04-22 at 15 27 18](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/38924/7275823/4f85a690-e906-11e4-8cac-a704d9412577.png)\n\n:sparkles: -- notice that they are attributed to pdf-view, not to Atom core.\n\nHowever, there are two other `Grim.deprecate` calls which are still being incorrectly attributed to Atom core -- the ones which check if the value returned from `onDidChangeModified` and `onDidChangeTitle` are `Disposable`s. \n\n![screen shot 2015-04-22 at 15 31 08](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/38924/7276006/59974f52-e907-11e4-9542-b5b935d43f1d.png)\n\nThose two calls are [here](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/ecd04446434e47c505d7f1d3d8cb0fb76e91aa64/src/pane-view.coffee#L119) and [here](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/ecd04446434e47c505d7f1d3d8cb0fb76e91aa64/src/pane-view.coffee#L128). As far as I can tell, I can't apply the same approach to these because they check if the _return value_ has a specific type. So it needs to stay there, I _think_.\n\nAlso, the \"magic\" which helps us solve the problem for the two deprecations in this PR is that we explicitly pass a package name to Grim.deprecate to tell it what package is involved. That \"magic\" is implemented in [atom.workspace.getCallingPackageName()](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/ecd04446434e47c505d7f1d3d8cb0fb76e91aa64/src/workspace.coffee#L483). So, I tried calling this method from `pane-view.onActiveItemChanged()`, where the two deprecations checking for a `Disposable` return values are located, but that call returned `undefined`.\n\nI'm not sure how to fix those two deprecations -- would love your help with those, if you have ideas. :pray: Also, maybe we can just remove them?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6476","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6476/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6476/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6476/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6476","id":70129576,"number":6476,"title":"\"Render on change\" sporadically displayed in status bar","user":{"login":"mnquintana","id":823545,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/823545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana","html_url":"https://github.com/mnquintana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-04-22T13:42:40Z","updated_at":"2015-04-22T15:29:23Z","closed_at":"2015-04-22T15:27:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I haven't figured out exact repro steps for this yet, but occasionally on startup I've seen \"Render on change\" in the status bar:\n\n![screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/823545/7275754/b3023464-e8d3-11e4-893e-88494cb754e1.png)\n\nIt usually seems to be with an unsaved buffer on startup, but I'm not sure.\n\nAtom 0.194.0\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4842","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"DD87:366F:BF7FC1:17540E9:59D92BA7","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=311>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=309>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"0b3e75efa15791a334936fb55fa3b263\"","status":"200 OK"}}
