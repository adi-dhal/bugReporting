I've spent some time trying to figure out how this could happen, but I can't.\n- In the flaky tests, we're leaking paths that are being watched by buffers that I _know_ are being created via `Workspace::open`.\n- That means these buffers should be destroyed in `atom.clear()` in the `afterEach` block that's defined in our spec helper to follow every test. As part of destruction, we destroy our watch subscriptions.\n- Yet even after destroying all editors and buffers, we still seem to be leaking watches. This leads me to believe there is some subtle error in pathwatcher itself.\n\nUltimately, it's not clear that the value of this global assertion really warrants this level of hassle. I'm making a pragmatic call to convert this to a warning. If we're seeing it a lot as we develop code that watches paths, then we're probably leaking. If we see it once in a blue moon on CI it's probably just this issue. I don't think it's worth it to invest more time understanding it right now.\n\n/cc @joshaber

post of this discussion says it all:\nhttps://discuss.atom.io/t/truly-soft-wrap-at-preferred-line-length/10633\n\nPoint is to have wrapping at preferred line length that doesn't change into wrapping at window's width when window starts to be smaller than preferred line length.\n\n**Suggested UI/logic change to maintain current behavior as well as the new one**\n1. [What's now]\n   There are 2 wrap related options in UI, \"soft wrap\" (sw) and \"soft wrap at preferred line legth\" (swpll), both are binary options, which gives 4 different states they can express, currently only 3 states are being used, \"sw: on, swpll: off\" & \"sw: on, swpll: on\" & 2 states with \"sw: off\" that do the same.\n2. [Why can it be problematic]\n   Imagine 2 buffers side by side, when you change the dimensions of the buffers, the smaller one (in case it's code) essentialy becomes unreadable, moreover wrapping changes the position of view into the buffer. Why not turn wrapping off then at all? Because it's usefull sometimes to allow very long lines in file yet to have the possibility to see all of it without scrolling.\n3. [How to do it painlessly with maximum backwards compatibility & keeping most of current behavior]\n   How about implementing \"correct soft wrap at preferred line length\" when \"sw: off & swpll: on\"? That way all currently working states would be preserved, everybody could pick her/his wrap style including the new one and only ppl who currently have \"sw: off, swpll: on\" would notice unwanted change - but then again, it would be a matter of changing the settings, their desired option would not be removed.\n\n**Atom Version:** [1.6]\n**OS and Version:** [Win 10]\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11303/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11302","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11302/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11302/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11302/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11302","id":144380956,"number":11302,"title":"[1.7.0] process.env keys on Windows are not case-insensitive anymore","user":{"login":"maxnoel","id":1538011,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1538011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxnoel","html_url":"https://github.com/maxnoel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxnoel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxnoel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxnoel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxnoel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxnoel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxnoel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxnoel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxnoel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxnoel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":62363277,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":14,"created_at":"2016-03-29T20:40:39Z","updated_at":"2016-04-16T00:13:41Z","closed_at":"2016-04-16T00:13:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n\nFor more information on how to write a good [bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) or [enhancement request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\nOn Windows, environment variable names are case-insensitive.\n\nIn Atom 1.7.0 for Windows, `process.env.PATH` is returning `undefined` if the path environment variable is defined as `Path` (it is then accessible as `process.env.Path` only).\n\nIn 1.6 the environment variable is accessible as both PATH and Path.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. On Windows, ensure your path environment variable (`%PATH%`) is defined as `Path` (not `PATH` as is customary on UNIX).\n2. Launch Atom and open the dev console (ctrl+alt+I)\n3. Evaluate `process.env.PATH`.\n\n**Expected behavior:** `process.env.PATH` should return the contents of the Path environment variable, regardless of what case its name is spelled in (as in Atom 1.6).\n\n**Actual behavior:** `process.env.PATH` evaluates to `undefined`.

I have the following SQL insert statement:\n\n``` sql\nINSERT INTO `dwp_terms` VALUES\n  (19,'عين المدينة','3ayn-almadina',0);\n```\n\nWhich renders incorrectly. It seems it might be a Webkit bug, but I'm not sure. It might also be that the text is ill formatted, but it seems to render correctly in Firefox and Apple Notes, albeit with the words in reverse. I've included a screenshot from Sublime Text 3 which seems to render as I expected.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Use the following piece of text as a template `(19,'','3ayn-almadina',0),`\n2. Paste `عين المدينة` into the empty quotes\n3. Incorrect rendering\n\nI do not know if this applies to more RTL scripts, but I've been working with about 40 terms that were \"converted\" to `INSERT` statements, and this was the only one causing trouble.\n\n**Expected behavior:** here rendered with Sublime Text 3 (however, seems to not render arabic correctly)\n\n<img width=\"406\" alt=\"Sublime Text 3 Rendering\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/416524/14080299/6a4500c4-f504-11e5-95a2-db7c83200a0a.png\">\n\n**Actual behavior:** rendered with Atom 1.6.0\n\n<img width=\"332\" alt=\"Atom Rendering\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/416524/14080298/6a2dc788-f504-11e5-8067-d7f7badda11b.png\">\n\nThe generated HTML, which looks correct:\n\n``` html\n<span class=\"source pgsql\">\n  <span class=\"meta statement pgsql\">\n    <span class=\"leading-whitespace indent-guide\">  </span>\n    (\n    <span class=\"constant numeric pgsql\">19</span>\n    ,\n    <span class=\"string quoted single pgsql\">\n      <span class=\"punctuation definition string begin pgsql\">'</span>\n      عين المدينة'\n    </span>\n    ,\n    <span class=\"string quoted single pgsql\">\n      <span class=\"punctuation definition string begin pgsql\">'</span>\n      3ayn-almadina'\n    </span>\n    ,\n    <span class=\"constant numeric pgsql\">0</span>\n    ),\n  </span>\n</span>\n```\n### Versions\n\n``` sh\n$ atom --version\n1.6.0\n$ apm --version\napm  1.6.0\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.11\ngit 2.7.2\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11290/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11289","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11289/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11289/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11289/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11289","id":143995302,"number":11289,"title":"right ALT is treated as CTRL-ALT on WIN","user":{"login":"retepaskab","id":5570057,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5570057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/retepaskab","html_url":"https://github.com/retepaskab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/retepaskab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/retepaskab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/retepaskab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/retepaskab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/retepaskab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/retepaskab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/retepaskab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/retepaskab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/retepaskab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-03-28T14:54:38Z","updated_at":"2016-03-28T15:02:48Z","closed_at":"2016-03-28T15:02:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Windows treats right-ALT as a special key, resulting in different character than it was pressed with.

Win10 Hungarian keyboard layout\n2. open some file that can be reflowed\n3. enter right-ALT-Q \n\n**Expected behavior:**\n\ncharacter \\ inserted\n\n**Observed behavior:**\n\nreflow command\n\n**Screenshots and GIFs**\n## \n\n**Atom version:** 1.6.0\n**OS and version:** WIN10 Pro, Hungarian 101-key QWERTZ layout\n\n**Installed packages:**\n\nunrelevant\n\n**Additional information:**\n- Problem can be reproduced in safe mode: Yes\n- Problem started happening recently, didn't happen in an older version of Atom: Don't know, first install\n- Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: Yes, doesn't\n- Problem happens with all files and projects, not only some files or projects: yes, any file\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11289/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11288","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11288/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11288/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11288/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11288","id":143992658,"number":11288,"title":"Uncaught Error: Unable to watch path","user":{"login":"aovchinn","id":3647829,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3647829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aovchinn","html_url":"https://github.com/aovchinn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aovchinn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aovchinn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aovchinn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aovchinn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aovchinn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aovchinn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aovchinn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aovchinn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aovchinn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":171329633,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-reproduction","name":"needs-reproduction","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2016-03-28T14:41:32Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T22:09:08Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T22:09:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[Enter steps to reproduce below:]\n1. open folder (path /home/alexzander/Dropbox/study/3year/2/optimize/first 5b)\n2.

to first open the Settings and then click on CHANGELOG there.

The problem/limitation we're facing with that API is that there is no way to know if the cursor is actually on that position or it is being trimmed to that position.\n\nAs an explanation of the bug, imagine you have a file with 50 lines, and you have enabled the `Scroll Past End` config. If you place your cursor below the last line, it'll still return the last line as the position. It happens both vertically and horizontally, so if you had a line with 50 characters and you placed your mouse ahead of it, it'll return the position as 50.\n### Proposed Change\n\nI would like to propose an option to the `TextEditorComponent::screenPositionForMouseEvent` function which allows us to receive null instead of clipped ranges. That way we'll be able to determine if the user has put their cursor there or is it Atom API trying to make things easier for us.\n\nBlocks https://github.com/steelbrain/linter-ui-default/issues/63\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11284","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11284/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11284/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11284/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11284","id":143709592,"number":11284,"title":"Use %F instead of %U for file variable in desktop file","user":{"login":"jonmast","id":599037,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/599037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmast","html_url":"https://github.com/jonmast","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmast/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmast/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmast/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmast/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmast/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmast/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmast/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmast/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmast/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-03-26T14:22:30Z","updated_at":"2016-08-06T16:07:24Z","closed_at":"2016-08-06T16:06:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/11284","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11284","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11284.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11284.patch"},"body":"The desktop entry specification states that %U is for URLs and %F is for\nfiles.

If I select only a portion of a line though, _duplicate_ should duplicate only that section of text, placing the copy directly at the end of the selected text range. For reference, this is the default behaviour in Sublime Text.\n\nHere is an Atom package that provides this behaviour:\nhttps://atom.io/packages/duplicate-line-or-selection\n\nYou could argue that there's a package, and that I should just use that, but every package added to Atom slows down the load time, and I would argue that this particular behaviour is something that should be in core, as \"duplicate\" is the behaviour we want. The fact that it's easy to duplicate an entire line, either by selecting it, or by having no selection at all, means you're not really losing anything by implementing this.\n\nIn addition, I would argue that any user that has selected a specific range of characters within a line and then uses the duplicate shortcut probably intends for their selection to be duplicated, rather than the entire line.\n\n**Atom Version:** 1.7.0-beta\n**OS and Version:** Windows

Description\n\nI keep experiencing \"stray\" changes to my files.  I'm mainly working on Python code, so I'll make some edits, and then run my code from the command line.  At that point Python complains about syntax errors.\n\nWhat will have happened is atom will have applied a slightly mangled version of an edit I did make to some other places in the same or different file.  For example I just added the line \n\n```\nimport pdb; pdb.set_trace()\n```\n\nto one file.  atom then also changed a different file (same project) so that a line that looked like this:\n\n```\n                            'org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager')\n```\n\nended up as:\n\n```\n  'org.    import pdb ; pdb.set_trace()s\", v, subkey=dev)\n```\n\nThe ``subkey` bit is a fragment from a different nearby line of code.  Fortunately I can usually use gitg to revert these when they happen, but it is annoying.  Sometimes one other place is affected such as the example above, other times I've seen it happen in up to 7 other places.\n### Correlations\n\nThis seems to happen mostly with Python code, but then I mostly edit Python code.  It has happened in other files such as css and javascript.\n\nIt seems like having Symbols-Tree-View turned on makes it _far_ more likely to happen.\n\nI have a multi-monitor setup and often have two atom windows each on a different monitor.  They are created by File > New Window or right clicking on a project folder and Open in New Window (ie I am not running two distinct copies of atom).  I am working on the same project folders in both and often the same files.  It is more likely to happen when I am doing this.\n### Versions\n\nThis has been happening since I started using atom (November 2015) but was at a very low level then.  It seems to be happening a lot more now (about 3 times a day).  However I am working more intensely now.  I have been keeping up with the versions.\n\n```\n$ atom --version\n1.6.0\n$ apm --version\napm  1.6.0\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.10\ngit 2.5.0\n```\n\nThe system is stock Ubuntu 15.10 AMD64 with 32GB of RAM.  I get the deb packages from atom.io after the RSS feed tells me there is a new release.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11280","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11280/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11280/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11280/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11280","id":143587406,"number":11280,"title":"Remove GitRepository git status","user":{"login":"joshaber","id":13760,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/13760?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber","html_url":"https://github.com/joshaber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-03-25T20:16:19Z","updated_at":"2016-03-28T18:16:01Z","closed_at":"2016-03-28T18:16:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/11280","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11280","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11280.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11280.patch"},"body":"Partly fixes #11214.\n\n`git status` involves lots of IO (mostly `stat`s).
