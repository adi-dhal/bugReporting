It seems to be made mainly to look super fancy, while throwing basic readability out of the window: especially on the tabs, the text is too small, too blurry and too low contrast.\r\n\r\nCompare this to Visual Studio Code which has a similarly nice color scheme, but unlike Atom's default colors Visual Studio Code has super crisp and high contrast text on the tabs:\r\n\r\n![contrast_comparison](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1573352/21582240/042f260c-d050-11e6-8324-eb2f494d1b30.png)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, even the file menu is just a tad more crisp and more comfortably readable with Visual Studio Code.\r\n\r\nBecause this might give an initial bad impression (it certainly did for me) and potentially needlessly uses up people's time for altering the color scheme and fonts to something more readable, I suggest that this should be changed for a future version of

There is a workaround that can avoid the editor hang.\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Create an HTML document with multiple long lines of HTML code.  A \"long line\" is defined as a line > 500KB in length.  For example, create a script tag and place the contents of a large file into it.  \"Large\" is defined as a file > 500KB in size.  Then create a second tag with the contents of another file.  NOTE:  you may need more HTML contents to reproduce this issue, if so simply create the code.\r\n2. Preprend an HTML comment to the first script tag, i.e. \"<!--\".  The code below will be re-colored as a comment.\r\n3. Append \"-->\" to the closing script tag.  The editor will hang while re-coloring the syntax.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]\r\nJust use the previously known coloration when closing the comment.  Why re-process?\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\r\nEditor hangs while re-coloring.\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\nWhen commenting long lines with an HTML comment, add the closing token first, then add the opening token.  No hanging occurs.\r\n- NOTE:  there's no reason to think this doesn't happen with long JavaScript lines commented with /\\* ... */.  Although unverified there's reason to suspect this could be a general problem for any programming language with multi-line comments in AtomIDE.\r\n\r\n### Note:  @50Wliu demanded we re-open this bug with a definition of \"large\" and \"long line\" per https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12784#issuecomment-249675622.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.9.9\r\nElectron: 0.37.8\r\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\r\nNode    : 5.10.0\r\n\r\napm  1.10.0\r\nnpm  2.13.3\r\nnode 0.10.40\r\npython 2.7.12\r\ngit 2.7.4\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13521/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13520","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13520/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13520/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13520/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13520","id":198148419,"number":13520,"title":"Markdown for numbered list in Issues Template","user":{"login":"ecbrodie","id":1844664,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1844664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecbrodie","html_url":"https://github.com/ecbrodie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecbrodie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecbrodie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecbrodie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecbrodie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecbrodie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecbrodie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecbrodie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecbrodie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecbrodie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-12-30T13:38:16Z","updated_at":"2016-12-30T15:58:47Z","closed_at":"2016-12-30T15:58:47Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/13520","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13520","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13520.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13520.patch"},"body":"### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nI changed the Github Issues Template so that the numbered list uses repeating `1.` instead of incrementing numeric values.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nThe current numbering scheme could still be used, but ... see *Benefits* for why I prefer not.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nThis is the code repo that this specific Issues Template is used for.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nI found that it is much easier to edit a numbered list in any Markdown document that uses repeating numbering instead of incremental numbers that represent the actual numbering that is rendered. It is much easier to add and remove any list element if repeated numbering is used. I only have to focus on the element's content and not the position that it appears in the list. Otherwise, I would have to also manually edit the numbers for any element that appears after the added/removed element. The numbering applied in the raw Markdown is ignored by the HTML renderer anyway, since it will be converted to HTML `<ol><li>`.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nThe repeated numbering may be confusing for those less familiar with Markdown than if reading the raw Markdown code with incremental numbering. However, I would argue that the learning curve to understand how repeated numbering will be rendered is quite minimal. Markdown has become a universal documentation standard in the software world anyways.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nNone that I am aware of.\r\n\r\n### Other Notes\r\n\r\nPRs similar to this one

Open Atom in Mac\r\n1. Close all app windows, but keep the app open\r\n1. Trigger the Mac Open interface. You can do so by clicking on File --> Open or pressing CMD+O\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** The Mac \"Open Dialog\" appears\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Nothing...The File menu will flash, but the Open Dialog will not appear\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\n➜ atom --version\r\nAtom    : 1.12.7\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n➜ apm --version\r\napm  1.12.9\r\nnpm  3.10.5\r\nnode 4.4.5\r\npython 2.7.13\r\ngit 2.11.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am using `MacOS 10.12.2`. I can also comment that I have been witnessing this issue for at least a year. It was just never a blocking issue since there are workarounds (see below).\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to have an app window open, in which case the Open Dialog will open without error. Or, I use the CLI to open a directory with the `atom` command.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13518/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13517","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13517/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13517/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13517/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13517","id":198069181,"number":13517,"title":"Cursor jumps by \"tabs\" not spaces","user":{"login":"jameshfisher","id":166966,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/166966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameshfisher","html_url":"https://github.com/jameshfisher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameshfisher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameshfisher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameshfisher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameshfisher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameshfisher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameshfisher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameshfisher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameshfisher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameshfisher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true},{"id":193722939,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"e6e6e6","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-12-29T21:11:27Z","updated_at":"2016-12-30T13:14:26Z","closed_at":"2016-12-29T23:05:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\r\n\r\nI can't get the cursor to move in the expected way when hitting the arrow keys, i.e. moving one character left and right.
