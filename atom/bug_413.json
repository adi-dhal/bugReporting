Abstract\n\nWe have many situations where we need to subscribe to streams of events, such as discrete events like `did-insert-text`, properties with values that change over time, and collections with contents that change over time. The concept of _observables_ unifies all these callback-oriented patterns in a single compositional framework. The [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) library provides a mature and full-featured implementation of the observables concept, and I'd like to try using it in workspace. If it works well, we can consider using it for our events across the board.\n## Tasks\n- [ ] Benchmark to make sure overhead is acceptable in simple use cases\n- [ ] :wrench: Replace workspace events with `::onX` methods that return observables\n- [ ] :wrench: Replace workspace behaviors with `::observeX` that return observables\n- [ ] Replace workspace `::eachX` methods with `::observeX` methods\n## Description\n### Events\n\nWe currently implement events via emissary's `Emitter` mixin. In the following example, we use `::on` to subscribe to all changes and `::once` to subscribe to the next change. Both methods return subscriptions which can be disposed with\n\n``` coffee\nsubscription = editor.on 'text-did-change', -> # ...\nsubscription = editor.once 'text-did-change', -> # ...\n```\n\nSubscribing to events with strings is fragile and difficult to document, shim, and deprecate. We've discussed changing the API to use methods instead, such as `::onTextDidChange`, but there were concerns about losing `::once`. Returning an Rx observable gives us the ability to use `::once` semantics and also ton more.\n\nOur `::on*` methods can be overloaded, so they subscribe if passed a callback and return an observable if no callback is passed.\n\n``` coffee\n# If a callback is passed, subscribe as normal\nsubscription = editor.onTextDidChange -> # ...\n\n# If no callback is passed, return an observable\nobservable = editor.onTextDidChange()\n\n# You can subscribe to observables\nsubscription = observable.subscribe -> # ...\n\n# But you can also apply operators, such as `::take`.\n# This is equivalent to `::once` from the example above.\nsubscription = observable.take(1).subscribe -> # ...\n\n# You can also apply other operators, such as `::throttle`\n# Here we will not handle text changes more often than once per 500ms\nsubscription = editor.onTextDidChange().throttle(500).subscribe -> # ...\n```\n### Properties That Change\n\nIn addition to events, we also need to track values that change over time. Observables are a great tool for this as well, and could replace `emissary` behaviors. For any model property `foo`, we could have an `observeFoo` method along with `getFoo` and `setFoo`. This would return an observable based on the current value of the property. Whenever someone subscribed, the `onNext` callback would be called immediately with the current value, then again whenever the value changed.\n\n``` coffee\n# Just like with `::on*` methods, `::observe*` can be passed a callback.\nsubscription = pane.observeActiveItem -> # ...\n\n# Observe methods return an observable when called without a callback.\nobservable = pane.observeActiveItem()\nsubscription = observable.subscribe -> # ...\n\n# If you only want changes and not the current value, skip it\n# This is similar to passing `callNow: false` to config.observe,\n# and could replace it\nsubscription = pane.observeActiveItem().skip(1).subscribe(@onActiveItemChanged)\n```\n\nCompositional operators can also be used to derive more advanced behaviors, such as `PaneContainer::observeActivePaneItem`, which will be based on the active item of the active pane.\n\n``` coffee\nclass Workspace\n  observeActivePaneItem: ->\n    @observeActivePane().selectSwitch (activePane) ->\n      activePane.observeActiveItem()\n```\n### Collections That Change\n\nIn addition to properties that change, we also deal with collections that change, such as the current panes, pane items, text editors, etc. These can also be modeled as observables. In the following example, `::observePanes` returns an observable that yields every current and future pane to observers.\n\n``` coffee\n# Can be called with a callback to subscribe immediately\nsubscription = atom.workspace.observePanes -> # ...\n\n# When called without a callback, returns an observable\nsubscription = atom.workspace.observePanes().subscribe -> # ...\n```\n\nAgain, the compositional nature of observables allows us to easily build derived collections, such as a collection based on all pane items.\n\n``` coffee\nclass Workspace\n  observePaneItems: ->\n    @observePanes().flatMap (pane) -> pane.observeItems()\n```\n\nSuch a method could filter on optional type selectors, allowing you to observe only a certain subset of panes.\n\n``` coffee\nclass Workspace\n  observeTextEditors: ->\n    @observePaneItems('.text, .source')\n\n  # The filter step would probably go in Pane::observeItems, but this\n  # illustrates the concept.\n  observePaneItems: (selector) ->\n    @observePanes().flatMap (pane) ->\n      pane.observeItems().filter (item) ->\n        item.getTypeDescriptor?().matches(selector)\n```\n### Conclusion\n\nRxJS provides a rich, seemingly mature library for working with streaming data in a compositional manner. We can utilize it in the following scenarios:\n- For events, by adding `::onFoo` methods that return an observable when they aren't passed a callback.\n- For changing properties and collections, by adding `::observeFoo` methods that return observables that invoke subscribers with current and future values.\n\nIt seems worth exploring as a robust solution to event handling in Atom that can slot in next to simpler approaches.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3377","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3377/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3377/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3377/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3377","id":41099242,"number":3377,"title":"Make

found that no matter what setting/file content is present, Atom will always prefer spaces over tabs if a file starts with a byte-order-mark.\n\nThis is because the \"usesSoftTabs\" function checks for the presence of a tab, instead of the absence of a space. The regex being used to gather lines just checks for \"whitespace,\" meaning that usesSoftTabs is checking if non-breaking spaces, etc, of which the Byte Order Mark is one, is not a tab. \n\nA file full of hard tabs, with no leading spaces whatsoever, will still have Soft Tabs turned on if it starts with a BOM.

git-pull:\n\n```\n/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/libexec/git-core/git-pull: line 11: git-sh-setup: No such file or directory\n```\n\nI am using Yosemite at this point DP6. I had this issue on DP5 and PB1 as well.\n\nAnother way to fix it is to manually modify a few git-core files and hardcode a few file locations.\n\nPlease let me know if there's any more info I can provide.

In practice, RVM may not be the only programming component or external package that redefines 'cd', and good practice would use \"builtin\" to guard against externals like this.\n\nWORKAROUND:  If I 'unset cd' to remove RVM's function definition of 'cd', and then restart atom from that shell session (terminal), Settings|Package works again, and I can install a package.
