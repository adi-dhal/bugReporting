Description\r\n\r\nAtom removes white space characters from the ends of all lines of the file being edited even from the lines you didn't edit, even it you don't edit the file at all: just load and save it with no changes: your white space characters are gone.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a test file using some other editor and put some lines there which have white space characters a the ends \r\n2. Open that file in Atom\r\n3. Save it back with no changes\r\n4. Check the test file and see your white space characters at the end of lines are gone\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** No changes in the lines I didn't edit. No changes in the amount of white space characters unless I ask for that.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** The white space characters are removed for the lines I didn't edit, even If I didn't edit a single line in the file and just saved it with no changes whatsoever, all the whitespace characters at the ends of lines are removed.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Reproduced everytime I tried that.\r\nI tried that on a machine running 1.15.0 editor on a 32-bit Ubuntu 16.04 then checked on MacOS Sierra where 1.13.0 was installed. 1.13.0 worked ok until I agreed to install some update, then it started doing the same\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n1,\r\nAtom    : 1.15.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\nLinux 4.4.0-66-generic i686\r\n\r\n2.\r\nAtom    : 1.13.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\nDarwin 16.3.0 x86_64\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nTry updating to your Atom through the menu. I don't see this menu on my Atom 1.15.0 running on Ubuntu, and in the 1.13.0 running on MacOS it is the 'Check for Update' menu item in the 'Atom' menu (which actually seems to do nothing as after applying the update and restarting Atom the version remains 1.13.0)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14048/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14047","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14047/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14047/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14047/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14047","id":216293813,"number":14047,"title":"Updated docs for the node: No such file or directory problem","user":{"login":"sanketh95","id":2802381,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2802381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketh95","html_url":"https://github.com/sanketh95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketh95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketh95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketh95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketh95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketh95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketh95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketh95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketh95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanketh95/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-03-23T04:29:00Z","updated_at":"2017-03-28T06:26:24Z","closed_at":"2017-03-28T06:26:24Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/14047","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14047","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14047.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14047.patch"},"body":"### Requirements\r\n\r\n* Filling out the template is required.

It seems to open a tab instead even though it doesn't look like a normal tab - fonts and colors are weird. Dragging the \"tab\" out of the old window actually restores normal/expected behavior. I've tried running Atom in Safe Mode and using different UI and Syntax theme. Seems to be something wrong with Core and not a theme or package.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nEDIT: MORE/UPDATED INFO IN

Add the following Code:\r\n```\r\ndiv {\r\n  transition-property: width;\r\n}\r\n\r\ndiv {\r\n  transition-property: color;\r\n}\r\n\r\ndiv {\r\n  transition-property: background;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\n\r\nThe keywords `width`, `color` and `background` should have the same syntax highlighting.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\n\r\n![bildschirmfoto 2017-03-22 um 10 54 50](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/419747/24192104/328b0250-0eee-11e7-87fc-ab910d26446b.png)\r\n\r\n![bildschirmfoto 2017-03-22 um 10 55 19](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/419747/24192105/33db41c4-0eee-11e7-9088-693e69534d91.png)\r\n\r\n![bildschirmfoto 2017-03-22 um 10 55 36](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/419747/24192118/3bfe44b4-0eee-11e7-912b-afe3a6ef99c3.png)\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\n\r\n100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.15.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\napm  1.15.3\r\nnpm  3.10.5\r\nnode 4.4.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.10\r\ngit 2.10.1\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties) lists `background` as an animated property, it also works in all browsers I have tested so far. Therefore I think it should not be highlighted as invalid. At least `width` and `color` I would suspect to have the same syntax highlighting.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14043","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14043/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14043/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14043/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14043","id":215996505,"number":14043,"title":"suggest the tree-view plugin can user-defined alias name","user":{"login":"gooking","id":7286469,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7286469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gooking","html_url":"https://github.com/gooking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gooking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gooking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gooking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gooking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gooking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gooking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gooking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gooking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gooking/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-03-22T09:15:01Z","updated_at":"2017-03-22T14:44:50Z","closed_at":"2017-03-22T14:44:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":" hi :\r\n\r\nin the version 1.15.0 , just like this screenshot bellow:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7286469/24190092/79bb66f4-0f22-11e7-845d-882c49694ef4.png)\r\n\r\nwhen  i add two different fold where has the same name，in the tree-view ,it is difficulty to specification witch fold is witch.\r\n\r\nso , is i can user-defined alias name for the \"view\" name, it is very easy to difficulty them.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14043/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14042","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14042/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14042/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14042/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14042","id":215959592,"number":14042,"title":"<script> tag in html does not fold","user":{"login":"stibinator","id":422938,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/422938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stibinator","html_url":"https://github.com/stibinator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stibinator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stibinator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stibinator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stibinator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stibinator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stibinator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stibinator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stibinator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stibinator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-03-22T05:48:03Z","updated_at":"2017-03-22T14:44:01Z","closed_at":"2017-03-22T14:43:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

Specifically, we will now store all the sources, digests and style sheet paths in the snapshot blob, so that we can load them all at once during startup and avoid accessing the file system at runtime.\r\n\r\nThe following is a CPU profile taken on master after merging #14024:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-03-21 at 09 52 17](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/24139415/49bfb1aa-0e1c-11e7-9ffc-08659daced45.png)\r\n\r\nIf we zoom in the various sections of this profile, we can see that `LessCache` shows up quite frequently:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-03-21 at 09 52 50](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/24139443/6028c12a-0e1c-11e7-9910-2278bb4506dd.png)\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-03-21 at 09 53 16](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/24139445/60528bc2-0e1c-11e7-9a15-f84a4bd50af3.png)\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-03-21 at 09 53 33](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/24139448/605d2f78-0e1c-11e7-8bd0-a45b2422d091.png)\r\n\r\nAfter these changes, this is how the same profile looks like:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-03-21 at 09 56 22](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/24139523/ab84caba-0e1c-11e7-96e8-9b1dc0f04dee.png)\r\n\r\nYou can notice how Atom now loads `~ 100ms` faster thanks to the minimization of the I/O associated with listing and reading less style sheets; this improvement should also make startup time more consistent across reloads because it will make Atom rely less on the file system.\r\n\r\nOne thing to note is that we will still need to update `LessCache` and, as a result, write and read from `~/.atom/compile-cache/less` when booting up Atom. We could potentially minimize that cost too by batching reads and writes, but we think we could defer this to later and address other concerns (like packages preloading) first.\r\n\r\n/cc: @atom/maintainers ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14038/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":5,"confused":0,"heart":2}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14037","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14037/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14037/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14037/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14037","id":215377357,"number":14037,"title":"How to disable \"Please restart Atom to apply the changes\"","user":{"login":"mdanetzky","id":3891637,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3891637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdanetzky","html_url":"https://github.com/mdanetzky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdanetzky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdanetzky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdanetzky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdanetzky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdanetzky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdanetzky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdanetzky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdanetzky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdanetzky/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-03-20T10:20:44Z","updated_at":"2017-04-05T14:46:18Z","closed_at":"2017-03-20T17:08:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [X] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAtom, running on Windows 10, crashes on launch revealing an error message popup:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9751401/24083518/a2bec058-0cae-11e7-9b8f-626fb2565fb3.png)\r\n\r\nThis happens for command line launches, launches from the Atom icon on the start menu, and from the command line in safe mode. Additionally, if I select reload and the program comes up (it usually does when I select the reload option from the pop-up) then it fails to open files, see this GIF (pop image to a new tab to see full-sized):\r\n\r\n![animated_fail](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9751401/24083535/f3f08862-0cae-11e7-8d1f-832ba2a99be8.gif)\r\n\r\nHowever, if I change to a new folder at this point Atom, and try to open various files, sometimes a file will open **and at this point Atom's file open behavior will return to normal**, at least until I kill it and restart. Sometimes changing to a different directory makes Atom briefly start normally, but this behavior stops over time; I cannot determine a rule for why some directories work/files open and other do not.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nI do not expect this to reproduce as it is currently only happening on one of my windows systems, and not on the other. This started with my previously installed Atom, which was working as of about a month or so ago, and failed upon my running it today (this follows the update to 1.15). However, I did a clean install and deleted ~/.atom, so:\r\n\r\n1. Do a clean install of Atom, including deleting `~/.atom`\r\n2. Launch Atom\r\n3. That would be it, except you're probably launched!\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Expect Atom to open normally without error pop-up and to open files normally.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Error pop-up occurs on launch or on opening files.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Error message appears almost all of the time, except as noted above.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\natom --version\r\n>Atom    : 1.15.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\napm --version\r\n>apm  1.15.3\r\nnpm  3.10.5\r\nnode 4.4.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.11\r\ngit 2.11.0.windows.3\r\nvisual studio\r\n\r\nOS/System Info:\r\n>OS Name:                   Microsoft Windows 10 Home\r\nOS Version:                10.0.14393 N/A Build 14393\r\nOS Manufacturer:           Microsoft Corporation\r\nSystem Manufacturer:       HP\r\nSystem Model:              750-150\r\nSystem Type:               x64-based PC\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThis is happening on a Windows 10 (home) PC. I have access to a Windows 10 (pro) tablet and the problem does not occur there, at least not so far. **UPDATE: this other computer is running Atom 1.14, not 1.15.** I cannot afford to break this one so I cannot check if this is the cause!\r\n\r\nI am willing to help diagnose, but I am not an Atom expert or developer so please spell out what you want me to do. 😄 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14033/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14032","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14032/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14032/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14032/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14032","id":215236029,"number":14032,"title":"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'has' of null","user":{"login":"joscha","id":188038,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/188038?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joscha","html_url":"https://github.com/joscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joscha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-03-19T02:21:22Z","updated_at":"2017-03-19T02:29:18Z","closed_at":"2017-03-19T02:29:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n0.
