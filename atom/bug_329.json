Now time is spent mostly on scanning tokens, which is something that needs to be addressed in another layer (see #979).\n\n![screen shot 2015-03-11 at 11 46 33](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/6594782/866d817a-c7e4-11e4-9d4c-0a5464c8551f.png)\n\nThe situation is dramatically different for soft-wrapped lines. For this particular scenario, in facts, there's a significant amount of throwaway computation involved. When multiple lines are joined together, the operation does not happen atomically but causes `DisplayBuffer` to continuously update the first screen line as more and more lines are joined into the first one. This is quite cheap when soft wrapping is off, but it becomes very expensive when we turn it on:\n\n![screen shot 2015-03-11 at 12 02 40](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/6595024/8ffc8432-c7e6-11e4-976c-0cf6665e5e90.png)\n\n:fearful:\n- One solution could be to make `updateScreenLines` smarter, and reuse previous screen lines as a starting point for updates. However, that would involve a radical change in how we tokenize lines and I feel like this is an improvement that we should make at a lower layer, e.g. while addressing #979 \n- Another way to tackle this would be to start batching `DisplayBuffer#handleTokenizedBufferChange` on `TextEditor#transact`. On one hand I find this quite smart, but on the other hand there's a lot of event-handling involved (e.g. markers) and I am afraid this change could break many things. Based on my first trials, I would say it will. @nathansobo: batching, batching everywhere :scream: :smile: \n- Alternatively, all those methods like `Selection#joinLines` could directly operate on the buffer, as if an external program performs the action, and `DisplayBuffer` sees only the final result. This is similar to the solution provided above, but addresses the issue from a different perspective, probably breaking abstraction.\n\nPersonally, I feel like the second solution provides quite a lot of benefits without breaking abstractions or changing how we deal with tokenized line. What do you think? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5931/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5930","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5930/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5930/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5930/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5930","id":60609006,"number":5930,"title":"Pasting puts the content at the beginning of the line","user":{"login":"kdelmonte","id":900997,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/900997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdelmonte","html_url":"https://github.com/kdelmonte","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdelmonte/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdelmonte/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdelmonte/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdelmonte/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdelmonte/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdelmonte/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdelmonte/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdelmonte/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdelmonte/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2015-03-11T04:27:04Z","updated_at":"2016-12-12T14:42:40Z","closed_at":"2016-12-12T14:42:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When I paste anything it puts my content on column one even if I wasn't on it.

I currently have the problem that although atom is running as a process (and even xwininfo is showing the windows), no window is displayed. I am starting atom as \n\n```\natom -l tmp/atom.log -f -w --safe\n```\n\nThe call immediately returns, so a window should be created. I suspect that even if my window manager was doing something strange (I'm using awesome), some sort of logfile should be created in tmp/atom.log, but that file is not created. Also, plugins should not get in the way because of the --safe switch. I even completely moved my ~/.atom - folder to another location to get a clean start.\n\nThus, I'm assuming atom is doing something wrong here. Since there is no output whatsoever, no log is created, nothing shows up in my syslog or Xorg's log, I'm at a loss to do further debugging. Any idea what's wrong

Is there a way to work around this? Atom-Shells http response code is 302 (which is a location redirect). The location object (as seen in the last line) is the same as the original request uri...\n\nAs I am not allowed to do something on the proxy (Squid) I hope there is a workaround for this kind of problems.\n\nBest regards,\nChristian\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5913/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5912","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5912/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5912/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5912/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5912","id":60428471,"number":5912,"title":"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'slice' of undefined","user":{"login":"clayzermk1","id":1075015,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1075015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayzermk1","html_url":"https://github.com/clayzermk1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayzermk1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayzermk1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayzermk1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayzermk1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayzermk1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayzermk1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayzermk1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayzermk1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayzermk1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2015-03-09T23:38:56Z","updated_at":"2017-05-16T21:12:12Z","closed_at":"2015-03-09T23:51:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"1.
