Also it should allow users to set custom project names (instead of showing the actual folder names).\n\n**Current and suggested behavior**\n\nCurrently you will have to remove projects from Tree View when you don't need them anymore and don't want to inundate the UI. Also you will have to name your projects folder unique to know what you're inside.\n\nThis should be not necessary anymore.  \nIt should be possible to group projects, like:\n\n```\norganization A\n-- project 1\n-- project 2\norganization B\n-- project 1\n-- project 2\n```\n\nAlso it should be possible to adjust the name that is shown in Tree View for a project.\n\n**Why would the enhancement be useful to most users**\n\nWhen you are working for multiple organizations or you are using Atom for private and for business purposes, you would want to separate projects.\n\nWhen working on projects where the source code is just a part of it, you will often name the source code folder \"sandbox\" or \"repository\". In Atom Tree View you will lose the overview when having multiple folders called the same.\n\nBoth things are possible in Eclipse. Eclipse stores the name of a project in `.project`. Groups are saved in internal files. \nIn my opinion those things should be stored in internal files, that they can not be copied to a remote repository by mistake.\n\n**Atom Version:** 1.5.3\n**OS and

The fact that the \"reindexing project\" message appears is pretty cool - however, because of how the layout is designed, it causes the list itself to jump (which makes it distracting). The layout should preserve a place for messages to be shown in the dialog without causing the list rows to jump around when the \"reindexing\" message is shown/hidden).\n\nI'm not sure if this is related only to the `One Dark` theme, because I saw it happen with multiple UI themes.

I'm not sure how to get the rounded corners that VS Code and Sublime have on the selection. I tried playing with border-radius and it sort of works but we need these triangles to fill in the bottom-right border radius (but only if the line is shorter than the line under it). An idea I had is we could perhaps switch to constructing a single SVG Path that is filled for selection. Perhaps @simurai knows a creative method to make it work in CSS. If there is a reasonable method to do this with CSS; the rounded selection could be left up to a theme to implement (and leave corner with pointy corner selection).\n\n---\n\nA question before I delve too much deeper.
