changing focus from the active atom window to another application's window there is an image/imprint of atom stuck on the screen. Some notes:\n- If a certain part of the newly active window is refreshed in some way (mouseover a button, panning a map, scrolling, etc.) that section of the window will show through. \n- Moving the newly active window only removes the atom imprint on sections that leave the view of the screen. \n- Changing focus via the taskbar does not create this issue. \n- Minimising atom does not create this issue. \n- This does not affect all types of windows (ie. Chrome is not affected, but ArcGIS is - seems to only affect Windows GUI based applications). \n- This issue is also present in safe mode.\n- Using the most up-to-date version (1.5.3)\n- This has been

Supporting them can **only** speed up regex evaluation, especially for grammars that use them, as well as reduce the number of Find and Replace hangs that kill an Atom window.\n\nConsider the regex `\\b(integer|integral|integrity|insert|int|in)\\b`matched against `integers`. The engine will match the first alternative, fail at the `\\b`, then backtrack into the group and repeatedly match, fail, and backtrack through every single alternative, even matching the group in the last two cases only to fail at the `\\b` again. This is quite a lot of work just to figure out `integers` isn't in our list of words. On the other hand, the atomic group `\\b(?>integer|integral|integrity|insert|int|in)\\b` will immediately give up matching the group at the second `\\b` and never backtrack.\n\nConsider also the regexes `\"[^\"]*\"` and `\"[^\"]*+\"` matched against `\"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`. Both fail, but the former backtracks through the _entire_ string, while the second fails immediately thanks to possessive quantifiers. When such behavior is desired (often for order-dependent parameters), this makes a huge difference for performance.\n\nBoth of these are simplistic examples, but it's easy to imagine more realistic cases where the patterns getting backtracked through contain multiple alternatives, subgroups, character classes, lookaheads, or all of these.\n\nIn particular, I remember that switching to possessive quantifiers when writing a parser for Foxboro's ICC format reduced the parse time for a complete CP280 program from ~10min to a few seconds, merely by eliminating backtracking. Unfortunately I can't publish this as an Atom grammar, because Atom doesn't support atomics or possessives (or [string anchors](9146)).\n\nIf this issue is due to Atom's reliance on the crippled javascript regex spec, then it's time to junk it for one suited to the 21st century (or even the 20th).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10868","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10868/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10868/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10868/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10868","id":134381197,"number":10868,"title":"Uncaught Error: spawn /Users/sbenson/Library/Application Support/com.github.atom.ShipIt/update.jj...","user":{"login":"Samji","id":8977840,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8977840?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samji","html_url":"https://github.com/Samji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samji/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-02-17T19:46:16Z","updated_at":"2016-02-17T19:56:20Z","closed_at":"2016-02-17T19:56:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[Enter steps to reproduce below:]\n1. right click open with atom.io from within GitHub the OS app\n2.

`default-directory-provider` incorrectly identified Windows file paths (e.g. c:\\users\\paul\\text.txt) as URL's. This has a knock-on effect for features such as the Tree View, which shows individually opened files as though they are directories (as opposed to the correct functionality, whereby Tree View shows the file's parent directory and highlights the opened file).\n\nThis was because the module was checking for the presence of a protocol in the path passed to it in order to determine whether it was a local file path or a URL (such as atom://config/something). Unfortunately, on Windows the drive letter (e.g. `c:`) was identified as a protocol.\n\nThe fix put in place replaces the check for a protocol with one that checks for a hostname. In valid URLs this should come back as a non-empty string, but on Windows it'll come back empty meaning the module correctly identifies the string as a file path.\n\nTested on Mac and Windows.\n\nLinked tree view issue is [here](https://github.com/atom/tree-view/issues/471)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10861","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10861/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10861/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10861/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10861","id":134299412,"number":10861,"title":"Compute line foldability lazily","user":{"login":"as-cii","id":482957,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/482957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii","html_url":"https://github.com/as-cii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-02-17T14:47:59Z","updated_at":"2016-02-18T14:27:38Z","closed_at":"2016-02-18T14:26:44Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/10861","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10861","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10861.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10861.patch"},"body":"Understanding whether a row can be folded or not requires to scan surrounding lines and it's relatively slow.
