on OSX. Pressing `ctrl` + `up`/`down` inserts a  or  into the document, both show up as a square in the editor.\n\nThis is a problem for me personally because. `ctrl` + `left`/`right` is the key combo used to switch between spaces. And my keyboard's arrow buttons are a single square directional button. Which often results in my space switching between browser and Atom to be a combination of both a horizontal and vertical `ctrl` + arrow keypress.\n\nOSX doesn't switch focus away from Atom till after it has finished transitioning to the other space. Because of this I'll often find myself switching away from Atom.

Since Atom's launch, I've started to notice more things seeking my attention in an increasingly aggressive manner.  They seem small in isolation, but when you add them up and make them recurring, Atom can begin to nag you.  \n\nBelow is the most recent example.  I wanted to take a quick look at some docs, so I run `atom .`  \n\n![screen shot 2015-05-25 at 10 30 25 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25/7800438/3c7af9e6-02ca-11e5-8dbe-b321bf2f7cde.png)\n\na. **Non-fatal errors are blocking content** - Is this dialog necessary given b.?\nb. **Duplicate update notices** - How can Atom minimize these or get rid of them completely? \nc. **The `!` feels unnecessary** - Deprecation and update notices now contain an `!` mark.  It's small, but this changes the tone of the message from informing me, to shouting at me. \nd. **More packages.  more notices** - It seems logical that the longer you are an Atom user, the more package you install, the more notices you are going to get. \n#### Deprecation notices\n\nWhen you click on the deprecation notice text in the status bar, you are taken to this screen:\n\n![screen shot 2015-05-25 at 10 55 40 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25/7800595/a39f238e-02cc-11e5-8864-90a7e4d5bf04.png)\n\nThis screen feels unnecessary to anyone _using_ Atom.  Unless I'm a developer or I'm specifically trying to debug packages, I'm not too concerned with what methods in what packages are deprecated.  I would like the deprecation message to go away so I can get back to work.  How can Atom help me do that?  Could the \"Check for updates\" step happen automatically?  Could updates be installed during relaunch or during idle time?\n#### Package updates\n\n![screen shot 2015-05-25 at 11 07 37 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25/7800708/52e0e5fc-02ce-11e5-86ca-9e0fb9bc78df.png)\n\nThere's 1 update available.  When I click the notice in the status bar, I'm taken to this screen that runs an additional check for updates and then lists the packages that have updates.  Does Atom need to run this check again since it knows I have a package that needs an update already? \n#### Some considerations\n\nIn the spirit of GitHub Zen, here are a few things to consider:\n- Atom should strive to not block content for non-fatal errors. \n- Atom should strive to keep notifications to a minimum.\n- Atom should strive to reduce manual administrative overhead (updating packages, atom, etc.). \n\n:bow:  Thanks for the fantastic work \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6945/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6944","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6944/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6944/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6944/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6944","id":80616931,"number":6944,"title":"Resource interpreted as Image but transferred with MIME type text/html","user":{"login":"mark-hahn","id":811455,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/811455?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn","html_url":"https://github.com/mark-hahn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-05-25T17:59:19Z","updated_at":"2015-05-25T20:22:45Z","closed_at":"2015-05-25T20:22:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've been getting annoying messages like this for some time in the dev tools inspector.
