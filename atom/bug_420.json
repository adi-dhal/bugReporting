It doesn't however, interact with appmenus in any way. And it doesn't seem to request them either. (unity.cpp lines 34 to 36).\nMy KDE desktop is configured to show all menus inside applications, so there's no global menubar active. So, despite the menus being exported, they are never displayed anywhere. It appears to be mistakenly confusing the plasmoid's presence (in DBUS perhaps?) as a global menu.\n\nDisabling Unity support in the plasmoid does allow Atom to show menus normally, as illustrated here.\n![snapshot1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/323651/3807946/f3796b74-1c6f-11e4-9f55-3a8d531ba564.png)\n\nAny way to attempt to prevent Atom from exporting its menus (blacklisting in Unity's dconf, environment variables, etc) doesn't seem to prevent the disabling of the normal menu.\n\nPlease let me know if any other information is required.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3181","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3181/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3181/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3181/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3181","id":39490165,"number":3181,"title":"Syntax highlighting when using \"{\" or \"}\" in string","user":{"login":"ViGrey","id":7667050,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7667050?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViGrey","html_url":"https://github.com/ViGrey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViGrey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViGrey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViGrey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViGrey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViGrey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViGrey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViGrey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViGrey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ViGrey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-08-05T06:43:45Z","updated_at":"2014-08-05T07:46:50Z","closed_at":"2014-08-05T07:46:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Brackets inside of strings are given the same level of priority as code brackets, so having the cursor set before\n\nHere would be an example in Golang.
