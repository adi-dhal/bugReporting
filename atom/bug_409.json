had a strange issue lately, and finally managed to reproduce it reliably. I noticed that at times I was unable to move my cursor around text with a single-click, requiring a dragging motion to actually move the cursor.\n\nSystem is Ubuntu 14.04 x86_64, with atom version 0.126.0-f357f69, although this issue started a couple weeks ago.\n\nThe way I found to reproduce it, is starting Atom, click around on some text. Expected behavior here, cursor jumps around where you clicked.\nNow after opening another pane (like a markdown preview in this case), clicking around on text will do nothing, requiring a click+drag to move the cursor, as little as possible, so you don't end up selecting text instead. Closing the pane doesn't return it to normal behavior.\n\nI'd include a screenshot, but it would be superfluous as it's barely something you can \"see\", and it'll look like I am just clicking when click-dragging.\nI've seen similar issues that might be related, but aren't exactly this behavior. Please let me know if this issue is more related to atom-shell instead.\n\nEDIT: More information.\nI use \"alt+space\" to open the command palette. I am having the odd feeling this is related to the alt key still being considered down after the pane creation. If I open the markdown preview via menu, it will not happen.\nalt+tab-switching out of the window will at times cause this as well.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3506/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3505","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3505/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3505/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3505/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3505","id":42341599,"number":3505,"title":"Add chorded keyboard shortcuts to OS X menu","user":{"login":"dmnd","id":4427,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4427?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnd","html_url":"https://github.com/dmnd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-09-09T19:29:23Z","updated_at":"2017-06-09T00:41:59Z","closed_at":"2017-06-09T00:41:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It took me a while to realize there were shortcuts for operating on panes because there are no keyboard shortcuts listed in the OS X menu:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4427/4207503/2c822b06-3857-11e4-85e3-6821ec6afca7.png)\n\nBecause a lot of other menu items have keyboard shortcuts, I assumed that the items without shortcuts in the menu had no shortcuts by default.\n\nIs there some API limitation that prevents chorded shortcuts from appearing in the menu bar?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3505/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3504","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3504/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3504/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3504/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3504","id":42275343,"number":3504,"title":"Traversing symlinked folders","user":{"login":"PixelVibe","id":1628148,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1628148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PixelVibe","html_url":"https://github.com/PixelVibe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PixelVibe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PixelVibe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PixelVibe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PixelVibe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PixelVibe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PixelVibe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PixelVibe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PixelVibe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PixelVibe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-09-09T06:37:37Z","updated_at":"2014-09-10T13:50:52Z","closed_at":"2014-09-10T13:50:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I might have missed the option somewhere, but I have read that in one of the July releases, there have been added an option to the fuzzy finder to open files from symlinked folders in the project.\nI still don't have such a feature nor I can find that option somewhere.
