That is, it goes to the end of the ACTUAL line, not the end of the soft-wrapped line. This means the cursor may move a few rows downward.\r\n\r\n`ctrl+shift+e` on the other hand stops at the end of the current row even if the line is soft wrapped to multiple lines. It also occasionally does not highlight the last character in that line.\r\n\r\nScreenshot: ![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kt675lvkrvlysjg/Screenshot%202017-04-24%2022.06.06.png?dl=0&raw=1)\r\n\r\nOn a similar note, if you go to any line beyond the first of a soft-wrapped line and press `ctrl+a` it only goes to the beginning of the soft wrapped line, not the actual line.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is unexpected because soft wrapping shouldn't affect what is or isn't a line. It is just tool to help visualize long lines easier. Unfortunately this isn't how it is behaving in Atom.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open up atom and turn on soft wrap (View -> Toggle Soft Wrap).\r\n2. Write a line of text that soft wraps to the next line\r\n3. Go to any position of the line in the first row and press `ctrl+shift+e`\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Open up atom and turn on soft wrap (View -> Toggle Soft Wrap).\r\n2. Write a line of text that soft wraps to the next line\r\n3. Go to any position of the line in the second row and press `ctrl+a`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** I expect to go to the end of the actual line, not the soft-wrapped line when pressing `ctrl+shift+e`. I expect to go to the start of the actual line, not the soft-wrapped line, when pressing `ctrl+a`. These would both be inline with what happens when you press `ctrl+e` currently.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** My cursor moves near the end of the soft-wrapped line (and sometimes misses the last character on it oddly) when pressing `ctrl+shift+e` and there is a soft-wrap. Similarly if I am on any line but the first soft-wrapped line and press `ctrl+a` my cursor moves to the start of the current soft-wrapped line, not the start of the actual line.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.16.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nOS: Mac OS X El Capitan - 10.11.6\r\n\r\nAPM:\r\n\r\n```\r\napm  1.16.1\r\nnpm  3.10.5\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.10\r\ngit 2.10.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nNone\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14293","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14293/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14293/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14293/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14293","id":223990767,"number":14293,"title":"Update Electron to 1.3.15","user":{"login":"BinaryMuse","id":189606,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/189606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse","html_url":"https://github.com/BinaryMuse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-04-25T00:59:52Z","updated_at":"2017-04-25T03:01:13Z","closed_at":"2017-04-25T03:01:10Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/14293","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14293","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14293.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14293.patch"},"body":"This fixes an issue where accessing properties on the `remote` module occasionally threw an exception.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14292","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14292/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14292/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14292/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14292","id":223979763,"number":14292,"title":"any plugin or way to grab the path when i drop the file on the editor ?

I'm Francesco Venuti and I founded UWP Open Source Community, dgsimone15 already contacted you about UWP, but you didn't seem to understand our intentions, so let me explain better ...\r\nWe are a team of Windows lovers and developers without any scope of make money. We would only improve our OS ... in the last year Windows 10 has improved a lot, for example today also incorporates a Linux Subsystem (WSL)... Now Microsoft also engaged the mobile challenge, it seems that they would change the concept of mobile computing ... so not just a smartphone, but real desktop experience that could run on ARM devices like tablets and smartphones (connected with a monitor).\r\nWe saw the preview of \"Windows Colud Edition\", this could be the next edition of Windows for education PC (like Chromebooks). Unfortunately for running win32 software on this edition, the software must be converted into UniversalWindowsPlatform app; after conversion, the software could run even on regular Windows 10 editions. If this could be a problem, you should consider the opportunities like: all UWP could use a telemetry to send information about problems to developer, guarantee automatic update every time you emprove your software, could impact on a larger and younger user base that can give You feedback and also start developing your software. \r\nFurthermore distributing your software as UWP mean that your software run in a sandbox that don't compromise the OS if there are problems.\r\nWe don't want make a copy of your work, rather we prefer YOU start publish also on Windows Store as alternative distribution to traditional installer.\r\nWe tried the online tool made by Microsoft for convert win32 software to UWP app, if you would use our work to start your experience on Microsoft Store we are pleased to give you all materials and information. Don't be scared about shadow costs, for publish on Microsoft Store you pay only the first time as developer registration, because your app will FLOSS, so there are not fee!\r\nFor us is important start Windows Cloud with a large amount of open source apps available for every one.\r\nScuse me for poor English...😉","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14290/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14289","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14289/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14289/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14289/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14289","id":223953458,"number":14289,"title":"Win10 Jump Lists do not respect \"Run as Administrator\"","user":{"login":"ZebraFlesh","id":10542617,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10542617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZebraFlesh","html_url":"https://github.com/ZebraFlesh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZebraFlesh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZebraFlesh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZebraFlesh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZebraFlesh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZebraFlesh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZebraFlesh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZebraFlesh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZebraFlesh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZebraFlesh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":62363277,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-04-24T21:15:27Z","updated_at":"2017-04-25T00:26:35Z","closed_at":"2017-04-25T00:26:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [X] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nOn Windows 10, recently opened files and projects are added to a Jump List. However, I have my atom shortcut configured to always Run as Administrator (due to stupid *$#!#$!!! Windows 10/IIS permissions). Unfortunately, none of the items in the Jump List launch as administrator. This renders the Jump List/Recent Items feature useless: I can't save any files when Atom is running with reduced permissions.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Configure Atom to Run as administrator\r\n    1. Launch Atom\r\n    1. Pin Atom to taskbar\r\n    1. Close Atom\r\n    1. Right click on the Atom shortcut in the taskbar to bring up the context menu.\r\n    1. Right click on Atom in the context menu to bring up the child context menu (thanks, Microsoft!)\r\n    1. Click on Properties\r\n    1. In the Shortcut tab, click Advanced\r\n    1. Check the \"Run as administrator\" checkbox. \r\n    1. Press OK to close Advanced Properties. Press OK to close Properties.\r\n1. Click the shortcut in the taskbar to launch Atom. Atom launches as Administrator.\r\n1. Run the Application: Open Folder command (Ctrl+Shift+O by default) and open `C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc`\r\n1. Open the `hosts` file, add some whitespace, Ctrl+S to save.\r\n1. Close Atom.\r\n1. Right click the Atom shortcut in the taskbar and click the `etc` Project.\r\n1. Open the `hosts` file, delete the whitespace that was previously added, and save the file. \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** \r\n\r\nChanges to the `hosts` file are saved because Atom was launched either (1) with the permissions in place when the recently used item was added to the list or (2) with the permissions defined in the taskbar shortcut.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** \r\n\r\nChanges to the `hosts` file fail to save with the error `EPERM: operation not permitted`\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** \r\n\r\n100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nWindows 10 Pro (64-bit)\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.16.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14289/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14288","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14288/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14288/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14288/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14288","id":223935069,"number":14288,"title":"Uncaught TypeError: Path must be a string.

Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [X] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn atom 1.16.0 (stable) I created styles to improve visibility of\r\n* active pane (e.g. background of tab-bar)\r\n* active tab in active pane (e.g. background of tab)\r\n\r\nI recently switched to atom 1.17.0-beta3.\r\n\r\nNow the pane with the active editor tab does not become active after starting atom.\r\n\r\nInstead tree view (which is in a tab now) is shown as the active tab in the active pane or no visible pane is active at all (I didn't find an active pane in developer tools either).\r\n\r\nWhen clicking on an editor tab it's surrounding pane does not get active state.\r\n\r\nWhen I drag one of the editor tabs to a new pane it gets the active state and the new pane is also active.\r\n\r\nAfter creating the second pane all works like expected, even when I close the second pane.\r\nSo I assume it's an initialization problem, probably related to the tree view being a tab or some thing similar.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. create a style to conveniently see which is the active pane (and it's active tab):\r\n```\r\n.pane.active {\r\n  .tab-bar {\r\n    background-color: #ffff00 !important;\r\n    .tab {\r\n      &.active {\r\n        background-color: #ff00ff !important;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. open some files in a single pane\r\n3. close atom\r\n4. open atom again\r\n5. try to activate the editor pane\r\n6. drag a file tab to a new pane\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nthe editor pane should be active after start\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\nEither the pane containing the tree view (left dock) is active or no pane is active at all (at least not visible).\r\nThe single editor pane cannot get active state by clicking on a tab or similar actions.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:**\r\n\r\n100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\natom-beta --version:\r\nAtom    : 1.17.0-beta3\r\nElectron: 1.3.14\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    :

ppas etc.\r\n\r\nnote, I have atom and atom-beta installed in parallel, but they shouldn't interfere.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nnot necessary but helpful:\r\na style (as described above) emphasizing the active pane and the active tab in the active pane.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14283/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14282","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14282/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14282/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14282/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14282","id":223589230,"number":14282,"title":"Need

This includes any community packages (maybe some built-in packages too, but not sure) from ~/.atom which may get preloaded. Basically, anything loading a community package has to synchronously await completion of `updateProcessEnv`.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Move/backup `~/.atom` out of the way.\r\n1. Add `sleep 5; export HI=5` to the top of user's login shell script.\r\n1. Put a debugging `console.log \"updateProcessEnv ran here\"` in `src/update-process-env.js` near the end of `updateProcessEnv`.\r\n1. `~/.atom/init.coffee`: Put a debugging `console.log \"HI=#{process.env.HI}\"`.\r\n1. Some random package in the exports file: Put a debugging `console.log \"HI=#{process.env.HI}\"`.\r\n2. Rebuild and install atom.\r\n3. Install a [crap-ton of packages](https://gist.github.com/steakknife/c621c0d56eeeb10265b2fb549112cf1b).\r\n4. Restart atom NOT from the command-line and check the console a few times for `HI=...`.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nPackages are always configured for user's login shell environment. (Always `HI=5`)\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\nBreaks because it's configured to the system-default environment.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:**\r\n\r\n85%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nf4a83b238

experiences significant performance problems.

Be in a _massive_ repo\r\n2. cmd-p\r\n3. Start typing (for example in mozilla-central: SandboxPolicies)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** The letters I type are rendered instantly, even if the search can't be completed instantly\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** The UI jerks around, the letters I type take multiple seconds to appear on the screen\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Nearly always\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.16.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nmacOS 10.12.4\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14275/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14274","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14274/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14274/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14274/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14274","id":223305232,"number":14274,"title":"Markdown syntax highlight glitches","user":{"login":"Yajo","id":973709,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yajo","html_url":"https://github.com/Yajo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yajo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yajo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yajo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yajo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yajo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yajo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yajo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yajo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yajo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-04-21T07:49:33Z","updated_at":"2017-04-22T07:27:13Z","closed_at":"2017-04-21T15:14:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

This is surprising because that's not how dragging works in the main window.\r\n\r\nThis is related to this excellent PR: https://github.com/atom/tabs/pull/252\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open a project\r\n2. Create a new window with `cmd-shift-N`\r\n3. Drag a tab from the project to the window you just opened\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Ideally, you'd see the shaded regions allowing you to open a new pane left/right/top...  But I'd settle for a drop in the content area working.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** The drag is ignored.  You must hit the tab bar exactly for it to work.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n![bug3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1776/25256002/af8eb80e-25e2-11e7-9f14-9629488d2fce.gif)\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nYou can get this information from copy and pasting the output of `atom --version` and `apm --version` from the command line.

While the ability to find files despite varying insertions around whitespace, underscores, etc. is *awesome*, when highlighting of matched strings in the paths displayed, there should still be a preference for matching the whole string.  \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Have files in project, e.g.:\r\n- `./app/views/hyrax/admin/appearances/show.html.erb`\r\n- `./spec/controllers/hyrax/admin/appearances_controller_spec.rb`\r\n- `./spec/views/hyrax/admin/appearances/show.html.erb_spec.rb`\r\n- etc.\r\n2. Find > Find File > \"appearances\"\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** If the full string is matched in the pathname, it should be highlighted. In this case \"appearances\".  \r\n**Actual behavior:** The \"a\" is highlighted from earlier in the path, and subsequently, only \"ppearances\" or \"rances\" is highlighted.  \r\n**Reproduces how often:** Deterministic, every time.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-04-20 at 3 14 52 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/109954/25254964/3dd326aa-25dd-11e7-90ef-4b507f846758.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.16.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14272/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14271","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14271/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14271/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14271/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14271","id":223213842,"number":14271,"title":"Do not treat packages in unusual locations as bundled despite name","user":{"login":"damieng","id":118951,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/118951?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng","html_url":"https://github.com/damieng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-04-20T22:01:34Z","updated_at":"2017-04-21T16:42:16Z","closed_at":"2017-04-20T23:38:08Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/14271","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14271","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14271.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14271.patch"},"body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14271/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14270","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14270/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14270/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14270/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14270","id":223210847,"number":14270,"title":"Very Slow and Laggy Package List Loading","user":{"login":"GeorgeWL","id":5931248,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5931248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgeWL","html_url":"https://github.com/GeorgeWL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgeWL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgeWL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgeWL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgeWL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgeWL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgeWL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgeWL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgeWL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgeWL/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-04-20T21:48:57Z","updated_at":"2017-04-21T17:26:08Z","closed_at":"2017-04-21T17:26:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?
