I just know the interface of Atom pops up and everything, visually, looks fine) when I run `./atom.sh` from the source code directory (which FYI is at `~/atom`). The only problem is that running `sudo script/grunt install` gives the error:\n\n``` sh\n/usr/bin/env: node: No such file or directory\n```\n\ndoes anyone know I might overcome this problem? \n\n**How I got my dependencies for Atom**\nI ran `sudo urpmi make gcc gcc-c++ glibc-devel git-core libgnome-keyring-devel rpmdevtools` (and yes I did just copy-paste it from the Fedora/CentOS/RHEL instructions [here](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/docs/build-instructions/linux.md#fedora--centos--rhel)) and installed Node.js v0.12.7 from source. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8282","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8282/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8282/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8282/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8282","id":99788289,"number":8282,"title":"Find and replace ignores select string","user":{"login":"rm-code","id":11627131,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11627131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rm-code","html_url":"https://github.com/rm-code","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rm-code/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rm-code/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rm-code/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rm-code/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rm-code/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rm-code/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rm-code/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rm-code/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rm-code/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-08-08T09:51:08Z","updated_at":"2015-08-08T10:38:39Z","closed_at":"2015-08-08T09:52:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"![giphy](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11627131/9149967/66165b72-3dc3-11e5-8c4d-1c0207eca7e5.gif)\n\nExpected Behaviour:\nAtom should replace the string which was selected for the searching process.\n\nActual Behaviour:\nAtom replaces the next string in the list and the string which was selected for search+replace will be replaced last. \n\n> Atom 1.0.5\n> OSX 10.10.4\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8281","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8281/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8281/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8281/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8281","id":99784635,"number":8281,"title":"Atom should use standard directories correctly on Linux and Windows","user":{"login":"sergey-shambir","id":1856842,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1856842?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergey-shambir","html_url":"https://github.com/sergey-shambir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergey-shambir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergey-shambir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergey-shambir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergey-shambir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergey-shambir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergey-shambir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergey-shambir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergey-shambir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergey-shambir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":225560994,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/feedback","name":"feedback","color":"fbca04","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":40,"created_at":"2015-08-08T08:49:07Z","updated_at":"2017-02-17T13:51:33Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"(updated 14 aug 2015)\n## On Linux\n\nXDG Base Directory Specification defines standard paths inside $HOME folders that should be used by applications.

so guys. People have been commenting on less-autocompile about it not being able to compile .less that uses javascript. It seems y'all did something to break the global.Function on 1.0.5. Anything lower than 1.0.5 works just fine.\n\nIn less-autocompile I use loophole on the global.Function such as:\n\n```\nvar oldFunction = global.Function;\nglobal.Function = loophole.Function;\n.... //do stuff here while replaced\nglobal.Function = oldFunction; //restore to default global\n```\n\nHowever, this does not appear to work in Atom 1.0.5. At least, it used to affect the less compiler parse Function, but it doesn't appear to anymore. I have proven that it is indeed 1.0.5 causing this issue again. I was on Atom 1.0.4 and lower for awhile and it still worked.
