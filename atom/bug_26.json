Instead I propose that instances would be per `$ATOM_HOME`. On Linux this can be achieved by having sockets be per-`$ATOM_HOME` it seems.\r\n\r\nThis would be helpful for IDEs (e.g. [Juno](http://junolab.org/)) which load a lot of IDE-specific features and UI components. With this PR you could simply have a `juno` \"executable\" that wraps around an existing Atom installation, but does not interfere with normal Atom usage:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\nexport ATOM_HOME=$HOME/.juno\r\nexec atom $@\r\n```\r\n\r\n**How does it solve it?** This PR puts the socket into `$ATOM_HOME`, instead of `os.tmpdir()`.\r\n\r\nI've been running `1.20.0-dev` with this change for a week or so now and it has been working fine so far.

The reason this long-standing issue is still open is that until recently this wasn't possible to fix from CSS (except on macOS with the `BlinkMacSystemFont` placeholder family) and would have required platform-specific code that resolves the correct family.\r\n\r\nEnter Chromium 56, shipping with Atom 1.19! It introduces the [`system-ui` generic font family](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5640395337760768) that \"allows authors to style contents so it fits within the system UI\". It works on all platforms! 🎉 🎆 🍾 \r\n\r\nCloses #8656. The same change should probably be made also in Atom's default UI themes.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nThe alternatives are keeping the font stack, or resolving the system font family programmatically.

However, the user interface will remain frozen even after the editor is filled with the contents from your clipboard. After another 5 seconds the editor crashes.

Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAtom cannot open the specified path on startup if `--disable-gpu` is appended to the command.  Adding `--safe` to the command doesn't change anything.\r\n\r\n![screenshot from 2017-07-22 09-35-06](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/515636/28486777-1262f068-6ec1-11e7-8067-552b940a3b5d.png)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Run `atom --disable-gpu .` in a directory.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Atom opens the specified directory on startup.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Atom opens a blank editor on startup.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** everytime\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.18.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.15\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n`--disable-gpu` is necessary as a workaround for #14776.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15072/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15071","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15071/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15071/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15071/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15071","id":244607633,"number":15071,"title":"can

It seems that they are being shoved to the right ~50 pixels... and as their Z-index is below the editor's this effectively makes them invisible.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Have a package installed that creates a custom gutter. (ex. `linter-ui-default`)\r\n2. Get that package to decorate a line.\r\n3. Note that the gutter decorations aren't showing visibly.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior:\r\n\r\nCustom gutter icons show as they did in Atom v1.18.0.\r\n\r\nLinter UI gutter on right in Atom v1.18.0:\r\n![atom_2017-07-19_15-42-31](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/427137/28393440-9f830d02-6c9b-11e7-9606-2022bde8283c.png)\r\n\r\nLinter UI gutter on left in Atom v1.18.0:\r\n![atom_2017-07-19_15-42-58](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/427137/28393446-aefaf542-6c9b-11e7-951d-2cb46219944a.png)\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior:\r\n\r\nCustom gutter icons are shifted to the right by a constant value (~50 px?), and background highlights don't show.\r\n\r\nLinter UI gutter on right in Atom v1.19.0-beta3:\r\n![atom_2017-07-19_15-49-17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/427137/28393471-c4c60448-6c9b-11e7-914d-6df2990ec239.png)\r\n\r\nLinter UI gutter on left in Atom v1.19.0-beta3:\r\n![atom_2017-07-19_15-48-58](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/427137/28393474-c80f7b98-6c9b-11e7-8bde-4e27f5491ad0.png)\r\n\r\n#### Reproduces how often:\r\n\r\n100% of the time.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\nOS: Windows 10 Enterprise x64\r\nAtom    : 1.19.0-beta4\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\napm  1.18.2\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.13\r\ngit 2.13.3.windows.1\r\nvisual studio 2015\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThe gutter decorations were first reported by @ooJerryLeeoo in https://github.com/steelbrain/linter-ui-default/issues/359, with the background highlighting pointed out by @50Wliu in https://github.com/steelbrain/linter-ui-default/pull/190#issuecomment-316501642 and elaborated on in https://github.com/steelbrain/linter-ui-default/issues/385.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15062/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15061","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15061/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15061/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15061/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15061","id":244163932,"number":15061,"title":"Trouble building Atom on Windows 10","user":{"login":"KvalheimRacing","id":19176631,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/19176631?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KvalheimRacing","html_url":"https://github.com/KvalheimRacing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KvalheimRacing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KvalheimRacing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KvalheimRacing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KvalheimRacing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KvalheimRacing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KvalheimRacing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KvalheimRacing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KvalheimRacing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KvalheimRacing/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-07-19T20:27:46Z","updated_at":"2017-07-20T15:23:12Z","closed_at":"2017-07-20T15:22:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nTried for a while now to build atom on W10.
