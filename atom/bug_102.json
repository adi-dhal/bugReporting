forced-closed after encountering a performance issue.  I searched for this issue but don't see it, although maybe it's worded differently.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.  Cause AtomIDE to hang.  To do this, create a file with very long lines that must be syntax-colored.  In most operating systems a dialog prompt will appear to \"force close\" the app.\n2.  Force close Atom when prompted by the OS.\n3.  Wait several seconds for any OS logging/recovery.\n4.  Re-launch Atom.\n5.  Atom re-opens the same files already open during the previous session.  The same long-lines must syntax-colored and Atom will hang again, repeating this entire cycle.\n\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]\nIt seems like a good idea to remember the documents that were open last.  However that backfires in this case.  Might as well detect a crash and clear the previous documents list to avoid an infinite loop of use-cases.\n\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\nAtomIDE re-opens the same files that were open before hanging and force-closed, and ends up the same cycle.\n### Versions\n\nAtom    : 1.9.9\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\n\napm  1.10.0\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.12\ngit 2.7.4\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12785/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12784","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12784/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12784/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12784/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12784","id":179305985,"number":12784,"title":"Bad Performance related to syntax coloring","user":{"login":"tenaciousRas","id":260223,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/260223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenaciousRas","html_url":"https://github.com/tenaciousRas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenaciousRas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenaciousRas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenaciousRas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenaciousRas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenaciousRas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenaciousRas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenaciousRas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenaciousRas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenaciousRas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":171329633,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-reproduction","name":"needs-reproduction","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-09-26T18:42:28Z","updated_at":"2016-12-30T14:45:04Z","closed_at":"2016-12-15T15:47:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n\nFor more information on how to write a good [bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) or [enhancement request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\nWhen commenting long HTML lines, the editor hangs if the comment is authored in a natural way.  There is a workaround that can avoid the editor hang.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Create an HTML document with multiple long lines of HTML code.  For example, create a script tag and place the contents of a large file into it.  Then create a second tag with the contents of another file.  NOTE:  you may need more HTML contents to reproduce this issue, if so simply create the code.\n2. Preprend an HTML comment to the first script tag, i.e. \"<!--\".  The code below will be re-colored as a comment.\n3. Append \"-->\" to the closing script tag.  The editor will hang while re-coloring the syntax.\n\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]\nJust use the previously known coloration when closing the comment.  Why re-process?\n\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\nEditor hangs while re-coloring.\n### Workaround\n\nWhen commenting long lines with an HTML comment, add the closing token first, then add the opening token.  No hanging occurs.\n- NOTE:  there's no reason to think this doesn't happen with long JavaScript lines commented with /\\* ... */.  Although unverified there's reason to suspect this could be a general problem for any programming language with multi-line comments in AtomIDE.\n### Versions\n\nAtom    : 1.9.9\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\n\napm  1.10.0\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.12\ngit 2.7.4\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12784/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12783","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12783/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12783/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12783/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12783","id":179301919,"number":12783,"title":"Adds feature: Restore column position after editor:delete-line","user":{"login":"vedharish","id":2497481,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2497481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vedharish","html_url":"https://github.com/vedharish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vedharish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vedharish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vedharish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vedharish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vedharish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vedharish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vedharish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vedharish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vedharish/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722964,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/requires-changes","name":"requires-changes","color":"fef2c0","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-09-26T18:24:28Z","updated_at":"2017-10-02T21:01:57Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/12783","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12783","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12783.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12783.patch"},"body":"Closes Issue #12744 \n\nNew behaviour can be seen from this screen cast\n\n![screen cast](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2497481/18846601/581b4bd6-8444-11e6-9b03-23ada04530af.gif)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12783/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12782","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12782/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12782/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12782/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12782","id":179296744,"number":12782,"title":"Remove unused variables (obvious ones)","user":{"login":"Ingramz","id":1017132,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1017132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ingramz","html_url":"https://github.com/Ingramz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ingramz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ingramz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ingramz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ingramz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ingramz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ingramz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ingramz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ingramz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ingramz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-09-26T18:02:26Z","updated_at":"2016-09-29T20:58:06Z","closed_at":"2016-09-29T20:58:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/12782","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12782","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12782.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12782.patch"},"body":"This is a split from #12189 to reduce cognitive load.

Note that this means that <code>@example</code> function parameters are no longer available as naked <code>example</code> variables within the function body.\n\nThis has only one major drawback - community packages which still use the old style need to be updated in a similar fashion, so before making a major release, we should give enough time for package developers to ensure their packages work with the new version. Most of the time it is fixable by adding a `@` in front of the parameter variable name. Inevitably this will also introduce issues like \"the new version broke package xyz\".\n\n<details> \n  <summary>\n\nIf you are a package developer, use coffeelint already and want a somewhat convenient way to check your coffeescript project for that specific error, expand me.</summary>\n\n\nFor Atom packages I used [coffeescope2](https://github.com/za-creature/coffeescope) with following configuration (add into `coffeelint.json`).\n\n``` json\n  \"check_scope\": {\n    \"module\": \"coffeescope2\",\n    \"level\": \"warn\",\n    \"environments\": [\"es5\", \"es6\", \"browser\", \"node\", \"jasmine\"],\n    \"globals\": {\n      \"atom\": true,\n      \"afterEach\": true,\n      \"beforeEach\": true,\n      \"describe\": true,\n      \"fdescribe\": true,\n      \"xdescribe\": true,\n      \"expect\": true,\n      \"it\": true,\n      \"fit\": true,\n      \"xit\": true,\n      \"jasmine\": true,\n      \"runs\": true,\n      \"spyOn\": true,\n      \"waitsFor\": true,\n      \"waitsForPromise\": true,\n      \"indexedDB\": true\n    },\n    \"overwrite\": false,\n    \"shadow\": false,\n    \"shadow_builtins\": false,\n    \"shadow_exceptions\": [\"err\", \"next\"],\n    \"undefined\": true,\n    \"hoist_local\": true,\n    \"hoist_parent\": true,\n    \"unused_variables\": false,\n    \"unused_arguments\": false,\n    \"unused_classes\": true\n  }\n```\n\nThen run:\n\n```\nnpm install\nnpm install coffeescope2\nnode_modules/.bin/coffeelint .\n```\n\n![screen shot 2016-09-26 at 18 23 37](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1017132/18840213/77bda71e-8416-11e6-8a5b-f43e6e1c3cac.png)\n\nUndefined identifier is potentially the problematic spot you will want to fix. In my case the following change was enough: https://github.com/atom/open-on-github/commit/1f19165cadec324a6f300e371ebfe3b72898e1fd\n\nAfter that it is up to you whether you want to keep using coffeescope2 or not, but it should help avoiding the most common issue that comes with this CoffeeScript update. Using coffeescope2 after this procedure is completely optional.\n\n**One extra note as I see people copying this configuration to their projects. Some of very useful functionality of coffeescope2 has been disabled in this configuration, so that we could focus on fixing the current issue. You are missing out on quite a bit (namely detection of unused variables, variable overwriting and shadowing), you might want to take a look at it by enabling the flags in configuration.**\n</details>\nCloses #9739\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12780/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12779","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12779/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12779/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12779/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12779","id":179203554,"number":12779,"title":"editor:auto-indent on a syntactically incorrect JS file consistently locks editor","user":{"login":"thedaniel","id":1476,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel","html_url":"https://github.com/thedaniel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":155497904,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/auto-indent","name":"auto-indent","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":52925411,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/performance","name":"performance","color":"d4c5f9","default":false},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-09-26T11:28:26Z","updated_at":"2017-09-26T15:30:48Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n\nFor more information on how to write a good [bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) or [enhancement request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\neditor:auto-indent on a syntactically incorrect JS file consistently hard locks editor.

Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nPasting a long line of minified JavaScript into an HTML doc causes slow performance.  This appears to be due to the coloration feature, and although it's barely acceptable I believe there are other bug reports related to that.\n\nOnce the long line is pasted poor performance is easy to encounter again.  Just highlight the newly pasted lines, and delete them.  I don't know for sure this is related to the architecture and/or implementation of the undo buffer, but that seems like a reasonable place to start.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open/create an HTML document.\n2. Create an empty script tag for text/javascript in the HTML doc.\n3. Paste the minified jquery JS into the script tag, the contents at https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.slim.min.js\n4.  Wait -- (repeatedly) clear any prompts that may appear due to system hanging.\n5.  Highlight the newly pasted lines.\n6.  Press backspace/delete.\n7.  IDE hangs.\n\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]\nDelete the highlighted lines and return control to the user.\n\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\nIDE hangs.\n\n*\\* Workaround **\nFollow step 4 above.\n### Versions\n\nAtom    : 1.9.9\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\n\napm  1.10.0\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.12\ngit

feature]\nI can scroll document down even if it has no lines left with data. There's a lower bound so I can't doing this continuously. The frame between last  line of data and actual 'lower bound' is about 25 lines. It feels like invisible 'something'.\n\nI've never experienced that before updating to macOS Sierra, but not sure if it started right after updating thus I can't be sure that updating to Sierra causes that issue.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. [Open any file with any number of lines]\n2. [Make sure you have n lines of code and (n + ~25) enables scrolling]\n3. [See the issue]\n\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]\nI want editor to show lines exactly document has and no more.\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\nI\n###

extensively use the collapse function of the editor. When opening a source file, however, the editor expands all collapsed functions/blocks. Is there a way for the editor to remember what was collapsed the last time?

Or provide a shortcut/button to do the same?\n\nEvery time I open a file I spend about a minute collapsing all functions that are of no interest to me at the time...\n\nThanks\n\nviktak\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12763/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12762","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12762/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12762/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12762/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12762","id":178747010,"number":12762,"title":"Make main-process/main.js as minimal as possible","user":{"login":"nathansobo","id":1789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo","html_url":"https://github.com/nathansobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-09-22T23:32:33Z","updated_at":"2016-09-23T16:41:40Z","closed_at":"2016-09-23T16:41:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/12762","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12762","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12762.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12762.patch"},"body":"In order to test changes to main.js, we need to rebuild the application.

Previously, we called `serialize` on each package during `deactivatePackages`, which was called when destroying the package manager. Now, we rely on `PackageManager.serialize` being called as a result of saving window state, which always happens before unloading the window.\n\nWe needed to change our window IPC code to ensure that all code paths leading to a window reload gave the window a chance to serialize its state. We also did a bit of cleanup while we were in there.\n\n🍐 ed with @maxbrunsfeld \n/cc @matthewwithanm \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12759/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12758","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12758/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12758/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12758/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12758","id":178674716,"number":12758,"title":"Redesign top bar","user":{"login":"Risengan","id":11879201,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11879201?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Risengan","html_url":"https://github.com/Risengan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Risengan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Risengan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Risengan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Risengan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Risengan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Risengan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Risengan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Risengan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Risengan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-09-22T17:42:32Z","updated_at":"2016-09-22T18:38:30Z","closed_at":"2016-09-22T18:38:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Before :\n![before](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11879201/18759403/a1f63a04-80fc-11e6-9f9c-4ff3754e895c.png)\n![before 2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11879201/18759405/a5de2e60-80fc-11e6-88f3-78c8ed826ab0.png)\n\nAfter :\n![after](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11879201/18759411/ae8be20a-80fc-11e6-84d3-833ca37aad93.png)\n![after 2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11879201/18759418/b0b56c40-80fc-11e6-95ea-4bc1ac29e793.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12758/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4129","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507404130","x-github-request-id":"923F:3670:9F0681:1997F13:59D92898","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=103>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=101>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"ab759e2606e08bca1db95bdf68065a0e\"","status":"200 OK"}}
