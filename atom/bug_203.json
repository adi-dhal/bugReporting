Now we are cooking with our timeline and profile dumps -- onto looking at what the timeline is showing us\n\n![screen shot 2015-11-20 at 9 00 03 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/883126/11307738/e391b6e4-8f6e-11e5-8b13-5c4f6a0a1b8f.png)\n\nLooking at the initial chunk before load is called it looks like we are being bogged down in simply requiring all of the modules that atom uses.. before we do any work at all we spend over 70ms at initial boot just in require module calls\n\n![screen shot 2015-11-20 at 9 02 47 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/883126/11307742/ea34c2c0-8f6e-11e5-816b-15ae5455af84.png)\n\nOnce the initial window.onload we get kicked into another 167ms of module loads before we even have even started setting up our new atom env (which does all of the painting)\n\n![screen shot 2015-11-20 at 9 07 11 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/883126/11307757/fb361150-8f6e-11e5-808b-e8fe8e67e79e.png)\n\nAnd then around 500~ ms we seen the initial non-blank paint happen. At this point we have a pretty good picture of where the time is being spent on startup in the most ideal of situations (where a user does not have a pile of plugins or custom themes to further slow it down). \n\n![screen shot 2015-11-20 at 9 13 53 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/883126/11307762/07e07d14-8f6f-11e5-8f61-6b7f8a5eb306.png)\n\nLooking into the work that is happening inside of setup window prior to painting we can break the 200+ ms down into specific segments of work that perhaps could happen after the initial paint, thus prioritizing when we draw the UI to the user before loading additional modules and doing work that is blocking \n\n![screen shot 2015-11-20 at 9 33 18 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/883126/11307766/12c780b0-8f6f-11e5-91e5-07498a5b3563.png)\n\nSo with all of this information, it is clear that we are paying a significant cost due to the number of modules that are being required and time being spent inside of the require load dance prior to even trying to run any JS. (one fun downfall of putting all of the requires at the top of all of your JS files).  The profile deep dive does raise the question of how much of this require work can be pushed off to happen async after the initial paint? Would it be possible to precompile all of the JS used in atom into a single blob to avoid the fixed require cost? How much of a progressive experience is acceptable for plugins? can we load them in after the fact or will this be too strange?\n\nOverall this profile shows that there is nothing that atom is doing wrong, there are just some interesting performance costs that most developers we never run into or care about given that the difference between a 200ms and 500ms startup is not something to spend time reworking the world around, however for a text editor where users are constantly opening new windows it can become quite noticeable and annoying.\n\nWelp, hopefully this is helpful! :sparkles: \n\nThanks again to @paulirish and all of the awesome folks at github and atom :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9720/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9719","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9719/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9719/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9719/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9719","id":118095328,"number":9719,"title":"Uncaught Error: spawn /Users/rab/Library/Application Support/com.github.atom.ShipIt/update.2v1lVR...","user":{"login":"rabgc","id":8348520,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8348520?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabgc","html_url":"https://github.com/rabgc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabgc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabgc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabgc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabgc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabgc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabgc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabgc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabgc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabgc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-11-20T18:13:43Z","updated_at":"2015-11-20T20:23:18Z","closed_at":"2015-11-20T20:23:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[Enter steps to reproduce below:]\n1.

It turns out that this approach could lead to issues like https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus/issues/614, caused by checking for the wrong methods.\n\nThe alternative approach herein proposed tries to solve this problem by exporting an `::isTextEditor` function in `exports/atom.coffee`. This allows us to not export the internal `TextEditor` constructor while still letting user to understand whether a given object is a `TextEditor` or not.\n\nI am going to open a PR that makes use of this new function in `autocomplete-plus`, where the problem first appeared, and search for other spots where we could use it.\n\n/cc: @nathansobo @maxbrunsfeld

Folks,\n\nI just wanted to report a small issue (possibly not an issue, depending on your view).\n\nI am currently running 1.2.1 and in the _Install Packages_ screen I see the Features Packages. This is really helpful for new Atom users.\n\nI can then search for a specific package (e.g. `emmett`), but then when I remove the search term from the text box it doesn't go back to the Featured Packages view. As such, the only way to see the Featured Packages is to restart Atom (switching from a different settings view back to Install Packages doesn't reset the view).\n# Potential Solutions\n\nA few options for resolving this:\n\n**Reset View Based on Typing**\n\nWhen the user deletes the search box so there are no characters, it could then re-instate the view.\n\n**Provide a Link**\n\nAnother option is that a link to _Featured Packages_ (and potentially other searches such as *Popular Packages) under the search
