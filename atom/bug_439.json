It made storage and rendering easier. There are 2 functions on editor that you need to be concerned with: `addDecorationForMarker` and `removeDecorationForMarker`\n- There are no more typeless decorations. You can apply to multiple decoration types by using an array: `{type: ['gutter', 'line'], class: 'sweet-view'}`\n- Rather than an option to handle softWrapped lines in gutter / line types, you specify a range of `[[4, 0], [4, Infinity]]` to apply it to the wrapped rows, and `[[4, 0], [4, 0]]` to only apply to the initial row. \n\nSee #2507 for the original decorations\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2605/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2604","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2604/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2604/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2604/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2604","id":35698395,"number":2604,"title":"Using umlauts in keymaps","user":{"login":"trkoch","id":73974,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/73974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkoch","html_url":"https://github.com/trkoch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkoch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkoch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkoch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkoch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkoch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkoch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkoch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkoch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkoch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-06-13T19:03:49Z","updated_at":"2014-06-16T03:33:38Z","closed_at":"2014-06-14T14:22:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"``` coffee\n'body':\n  'cmd-ä': 'pane:show-next-item'\n\n'body':\n  'cmd-ö': 'pane:show-previous-item'\n```\n\n`cmd-ä` is ignored while `cmd-ö` correctly triggers `show-previous-pane`.
