I may open a file and the scrollbar is initially visible, but it will eventually disappear. From that state, changing the height of the scrollbar content (opening find-and-replace, resize window, etc) will cause the scrollbar to toggle between visible and invisible. From the inspector, the vertical-scrollbar and scrollbar-content don't seem to change other than the \"height: ###px\" of the scrollbar-content element changing. Manually changing the height in the style of the element also flips it's visibility on/off. It can even occur while scrolling with the mouse.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Generate a large file, I used: `python -c '[print((n,)*50) for n in range(1000)]' > f`\r\n2. Open the file with atom, using angle: `electron --app=/usr/lib/atom --use-gl=angle ./f` (I'm using angle because of this virtualbox issue: [Virtualbox 15417](https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/15417), without it, atom causes the desktop to lock up. `--disable-gpu` has the same effect as far as this issue is concerned.) \r\n3. Observe the scrollbar disappear while resizing editor pane, triggered by scrolling, resizing window, opening/closing find-and-replace panel, etc.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** The scrollbar appears on the side of the editor and never disappears under any resize.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Scrollbar disappears and reappears when editor is resized.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Inconsistently. I'm able to reproduce it every time by opening a the file like above. However, it does not always trigger on opening a new file from within atom.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nPlatform: Arch Linux, up-to-date as of 26/7/2017\r\nAtom    : 1.18.0\r\nElectron: 1.4.16\r\nChrome  : 53.0.2785.143\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\napm  1.18.3\r\nnpm  5.3.0\r\nnode 8.2.1 x64\r\npython 2.7.13\r\ngit 2.13.3\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nIf a second file is opened in atom, this scrollbar issue is observed independently. The issue appears to be specific to a file's window/tab and having the issue observed for one file's window/tab doesn't seem to have any impact on whether or not it will be observed when switching focus to another file. Closing and re-opening a file may temporarily alleviate the issue but switching context between files does not.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15106","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15106/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15106/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15106/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15106","id":246055810,"number":15106,"title":"PHP instanceof word","user":{"login":"BerkhanBerkdemir","id":24360355,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/24360355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BerkhanBerkdemir","html_url":"https://github.com/BerkhanBerkdemir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BerkhanBerkdemir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BerkhanBerkdemir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BerkhanBerkdemir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BerkhanBerkdemir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BerkhanBerkdemir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BerkhanBerkdemir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BerkhanBerkdemir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BerkhanBerkdemir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BerkhanBerkdemir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-07-27T14:20:08Z","updated_at":"2017-07-27T14:33:46Z","closed_at":"2017-07-27T14:33:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"First of all it is not an issue.

There is no spec for single-line selected text being indented via `indent()`: https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/a7736b81e3f6628f2a9e685f28f4c1df9a5e4615/spec/text-editor-spec.coffee#L3673-L3789\r\n\r\n2. `indentSelectedRows` (which is used in `indent()`) is poorly documented:\r\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/blob/a7736b81e3f6628f2a9e685f28f4c1df9a5e4615/src/selection.coffee#L671-L679\r\n    > If the selection spans multiple rows, indent all of them.\r\n\r\n    It's possible to interpret this in a way that if the selection does not span across multiple rows, then nothing gets indented. [_Insert your favorite programmer-goes-to-grocery-store-joke here._](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1nmkfq/a_programmer_is_going_to_the_grocery_store/)\r\n\r\n3. The current behavior is not intuitive and unexpected for anyone coming from a different editor. With the exception of Brackets, other text editors tend to agree that selecting text and pressing tab within a single line should not indent the whole line, but insert/overwrite with a tab.\r\n\r\nOutdent is done through `outdentSelectedRows`, which [has a spec for single line selected text](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/2420d12e44f33f0178c8c0ef41e3a2c22cf4fb8e/spec/text-editor-spec.coffee#L4265-L4270). However it seems to be slightly mislabeled, there is actually less than one line selected. That is not a big deal and can be easily fixed, but it's possible that something is missing from here too.\r\n\r\nAt minimum I am looking to define behavior for following cases:\r\n1. Selecting whole line and issuing `indent()`.\r\n2. Selecting substring within line with length greater than 0 and issuing `indent()`.\r\n3. Selecting whole line and issuing `outdentSelectedRows()`.\r\n4. Selecting substring within line with length greater than 0 and issuing `outdentSelectedRows()`.\r\n\r\nThere might be additional cases that might need be considered, but I don't want this to be come overly ambitious, so starting with a more managable goal might be better.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for all of this comes from behavior related to text selections that come from traversing tab stops within snippets, where indenting/outdenting may lead to unexpected results:\r\n\r\n![indent_snippet1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1017132/28608860-e7ee5908-71ea-11e7-8bc2-19aadfcc2a3b.gif)\r\n![indent_snippet2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1017132/28608859-e7edd960-71ea-11e7-90d3-7b1bfb94e899.gif)\r\n\r\nPersonally I think that outdent behavior can be kept as-is and it is sufficient to simply improve the spec and cover cases 3 and 4. Outdenting does not break out of snippet's tab stops whereas indenting does, so indicating change with a slightly more destructive (but predictable) operation should be obvious enough that it's impossible to return to snippet's tab stops.\r\n\r\nVisual Studio Code's behavior is a suitable candidate, which indents if the whole line is selected, but inserts a tab when only part of line is selected. Outdent is handled in the same way as Atom does it now. If there aren't any objections or better ideas, I might just implement that and propose this as the final solution.\r\n\r\nCode at the time of writing in pull request is just to get the ball rolling and does not represent the final proposed solution in any way. But it does replace everything with a tab if at most only one line has been selected.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15096/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15095","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15095/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15095/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15095/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15095","id":245626801,"number":15095,"title":"The editör has crashed.
