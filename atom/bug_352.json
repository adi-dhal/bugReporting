This implements the gutter API described in https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5038.\n\nTest Plan: Added unit tests. Tested manually as well -- if you rebase before the commit \"Remove test-only CSS\", there is some default CSS that makes gutters and decorations obviously visible when you add them via commands in the console. Example test commands, on top of this default CSS:\n\n``` javascript\nvar e = atom.workspace.getActiveEditor()\nvar g = e.addGutter({name: 'test'})\n\nvar m = e.markBufferRange([[1, 0], [10, 0]])\nvar d = e.decorateMarker(m, {type: 'gutter', gutterName: 'test', class: 'test-class'})\n\nvar item = document.createElement('div')\nitem.className = 'test-item'\nitem.style['background-color'] = 'green'\nvar m2 = e.markBufferRange([[12, 0], [20, 0]])\nvar di = e.decorateMarker(m2, {type: 'gutter', gutterName: 'test', class: 'test-class', item: item})\n```\n\nUpdating:\n\n``` javascript\nvar item2 = document.createElement('div')\nitem2.className = 'test-item2'\nitem2.style['background-color'] = 'red'\ndi.setProperties({type: 'gutter', gutterName: 'test', class: 'test-class2', item:
