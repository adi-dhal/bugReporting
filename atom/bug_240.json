objects does not respect `*.editor.fontFamily` setups in `config.cson`, which together with issue #6214 is causing Chinese (and possibly other nonlatin characters) not displaying correctly in the application.\n\nIn #6214, setting up a Chinese font in  `*.editor.fontFamily` in `config.cson` solves Chinese displaying problems, but this issue causes fonts in panels not readable even though these options are setup as mentioned above.\n\nSome screenshots:\n\n![screen](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1768423/9574431/6f7ec67a-4ff9-11e5-9e80-d16dc2499831.png)\n\nThe font in the mini-editor and the font in the list are apparently not the same.\n\n![screen2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1768423/9574482/fe793df6-4ff9-11e5-8b50-61bd6ff4b928.png)\n\nChinese font not displaying correctly in tree-view panel.\n\n![screen3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1768423/9573268/e0ac1e4a-4fec-11e5-8f4f-f6f1615a5430.png)\n\nChinese font not displaying correctly in clipboard panel from package aki77/atom-clipboard-plus, already reported as aki77/atom-clipboard-plus#6\n\nMy system:\n\n```\nVersion 1.0.7\nOS: Linux 64bit\nDistro: Arch Linux\nPackage: atom-editor-bin\n```\n\nI don't know if this is a bug or an intended behavior, but I suggest that it though may not be a brilliant idea to make all `atom-panel`s using the same font setup from `*.editor.fontFamily`, cause the setup may be mainly mean to set the **editor** interface font, but adding another option that could change these fonts in other components of the interface is surely a good idea and should be welcomed.\n\natom/tree-view#501 may be related to this issue.\n\n_For these who come up with the same problem as me_, here's a **workaround**:\n\nAdding these lines to `styles.less`\n\n``` less\natom-panel {\n  font-family: \"Liberation Mono\", \"WenQuanYi Micro Hei Mono\" !important;\n  // Replace with preferred fonts.\n}\n```\n\nHowever, there may be some panels that use components like `<pre>` `<code>`, which has explicit font-family override rules in `bootstrap.css` or other stylesheets, and these rules will cause these components not accepting the generic rules we added above, so they should be specified alone:( Taking clipboard panel from aki77/atom-clipboard-plus, which uses `<pre>` for example )\n\n``` less\natom-panel.clipboard-plus .select-list ol.list-group li pre{\n  font-family: \"Liberation Mono\", \"WenQuanYi Micro Hei Mono\" !important;\n}\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8590/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4912","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"8C9A:429A:7E8DC7:1537A8B:59D92AAE","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=241>;
