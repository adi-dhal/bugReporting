Place cursor in the middle of a file\r\n2. Execute the following code in the console and observe odd rendering:\r\n```js\r\nconst item = document.createElement(\"span\")\r\nconst editor = atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor()\r\nconst cursorRow = editor.getCursorBufferPosition().row\r\nconst marker = editor.markBufferPosition([cursorRow, 0])\r\neditor.decorateMarker(marker, { type: \"block\", item: item })\r\nsetTimeout(() => {\r\n  item.innerText = \"[block decoration]\\n[block decoration]\\n[block decoration]\\n[block decoration]\"\r\n}, 100)\r\n```\r\n3. Resize window to see layout recalculation and correct rendering\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior (Atom 1.18):**\r\n![1 18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13285808/27311181-846d3ea0-555f-11e7-920d-6412308f1fe2.gif)\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior (Atom 1.19 and

If I have Atom pinned to the taskbar and Atom is currently running, when I click the pinned icon again, a new instance opens. Since this also happens when running Atom from the Start Menu, the issue would probably happen using any method of launching.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nEdit: Just go to the Start Menu, run Atom, then repeat\r\n\r\n1. Windows is configured to show taskbar icons only on the monitor where an application is opened (see screenshot @ https://vgy.me/EFxAG1.png)\r\n2. Open Atom\r\n3. Pin Atom to Taskbar\r\n4.

I have never had a problem with Atom in the past, so I'm a little confused as to what changed other than the removal of a specific Atom package called Nuclide (nuclide.io).\r\n\r\nThe package was working fine when I was trying it out, I just didn't really like it. I followed the uninstall steps from their website (apm uninstall nuclide), and at first everything was fine. A few days later and everything started crashing.\r\n\r\nI tried running the editor in Safe Mode but it still crashed. I then tried following the debugging guide and reinstalling Atom, even tried the beta version in case that had a fix but nothing resolved the issue.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this will reproduce the issue, but installing Nuclide and then reverting Atom back to its \"factory defaults\" is the only thing I am aware of that could be causing the problem. Unfortunately there isn't any error messaging to share, at least to my knowledge.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Atom should open and run without crashing.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Atom crashes quickly after opening. \r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** For me 100%.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.18.x & 1.19.0-beta0\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    :
