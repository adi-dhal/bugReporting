Likely is a bug. Causes a crash.\n\nI'm not sure where the issue is, but since it's Atom that crashes as a result, I assume I should report it here. If it turns out to be issue somewhere else, I'll take my time to report it in the appropriate place.\n### Software involved\n1. Firefox Developer Edition 40.0a2 (installed from [Firefox Aurora PPA](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-mozilla-daily/+archive/ubuntu/firefox-aurora) as `firefox`)\n2. Atom 0.210.0 (installed from [Webupd8 PPA](https://launchpad.net/~webupd8team/+archive/ubuntu/atom))\n3. Linux Mint 17.1 Rebecca, XFCE edition, fully updated and with XFCE 4.12\n\nNot sure if the last one is important, I'll add others to the list or remove the point altogether if the specific Linux distro turns out to be irrelevant.\n### Steps to reproduce:\n1. Run Firefox and open some tabs\n2. Run Atom in safe mode to isolate the issue (I used `atom --safe .` from terminal)\n3. Grab one of the Firefox' tabs and drag it over the Atom's window, not releasing the mouse button\n\n**Result**: Atom crashes, outputting the following into the terminal:\n\n```\n[10718:0622/124154:ERROR:browser_main_loop.cc(170)] Running without the SUID sandbox!

is a Code Editor/IDE for Developers and those developers make mistakes. A base linter provider is something that everyone needs. There was a time when `linter` API and codebase wasn't shiny enough for it to be made a part of core.\n\nBut now we have rebuilt the `linter` package from the ground and consumed the latest technologies (i.e services) to provide API to linters. It's [API](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-plus/wiki/Linter-API) and other docs can be found in the [linter-plus](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-plus) wiki. It's API is inspired from the awesome `autocomplete-plus`. The rewrite also features a completely new UI based on suggestions from the AtomLinter Org members and styles from @simurai . Furthermore it accepts anonymous objects as messages allowing the providers to write unit-tests.\n\nIt also has a UI to show errors from the current file or project. Which is very important for the Nuclide IDE and project-based languages like FlowJS, HackLang and others. and the Error Objects can contain traces that expand over the lines. It is also extremely easy to style. and It doesn't have to save a temp file to disk to lint files. It also supports `lintOnFly` and `onSave` linters.\n\nIt even exports it's self service to packages who have daemons in separate processes and want to trigger lint without waiting for a save or change in the buffer. Also in the tooltip and bottom panel are positions that user can click on and be directed to the file:line:col instead of just jumping to the next error.\n\nAll these features remove all of the known limitations of old `linter` package.\n**Note:** It's also backward compatible, so all the linters using the old API will still work.\n\nHere is how it looks like at the moment\n![screenshot from 2015-06-20 19 09 10](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4278113/8269940/e232c69c-177f-11e5-8710-8b2acf1380fb.png)\n\nThere are a lot of packages that have re-invented the wheel and written their own error UIs. If we merge `linter` in the core, all those packages can consume a similar API and eventually reduce their code complexity.\n\nThings to be done\n- [ ] Make the code shine bright (We have been working [hard](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-plus/graphs) on this one)\n- [ ] Move it to the `atom` org.\n\nLet us know what you guys think.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7353/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7352","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7352/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7352/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7352/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7352","id":89824823,"number":7352,"title":"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of null","user":{"login":"lczech","id":4741887,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4741887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lczech","html_url":"https://github.com/lczech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lczech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lczech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lczech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lczech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lczech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lczech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lczech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lczech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lczech/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":211058624,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/uncaught-exception","name":"uncaught-exception","color":"e11d21","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-06-20T22:11:41Z","updated_at":"2017-03-06T14:27:11Z","closed_at":"2015-07-10T21:19:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[Enter steps to reproduce below:]\n\nCannot reproduce, but maybe the stack trace is still helpful.

Pressed something like `ctrl + z` and `x` at the same time (by accident).\n\nThe current line was cut (so probably `ctrl+x` happend first), but using `ctrl+z` did not restore it, instead I received

are a few hard-to-reproduce uncaught exceptions lurking in Atom that are giving a subset of our users a hard time. Until now, in order to solve these kinds of mysteries, our only option other than raw luck with reproduction steps or a brilliant stroke of insight was to be more aggressive about throwing exceptions when getting into an invalid state. But, of course, we're extremely reluctant to do that because who wants to introduce an even greater chance of throwing an exception?!\n\nThis PR enables a better approach by adding a new tool to our box: `atom.assert`. This global method takes a condition, a description message, and an optional metadata callback as follows:\n\n``` coffee\natom.assert a is b, \"a is b\", -> {a, b}\n```\n\nNow, whenever we have uncaught exceptions, our goal should be as follows:\n- If appropriate, do something to suppress the exception. This may lead to other, weirder errors, but we also may survive without the user ever noticing. This is obviously an extremely short-term strategy, and it will need to be applied judiciously.\n- Start forming hypotheses and seasoning in efficient-to-run assertions that can investigate how and where things might be going wrong. This will enable us to start chasing errors to their source as we put out releases.\n\nAn example of this approach is included in this PR, referencing #5905.\n\n@atom/feedback Once we start doing this, it could be fairly important to know if an assertion has failed when someone is reporting a bug. We'll be reporting assertion failures to bugsnag and logging them to the console. Do we want some other indicator? My main thing is that we need to be able to insert assertions without interrupting a user's flow.\n\nIt's also worth noting that this changes the API of `atom.onDidThrowError` to yield the entire `Error` object to subscribers. It's made backward-compatible by adding the old event properties to the error object. I found no packages that use this method, so it should be pretty safe to change this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7349","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7349/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7349/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7349/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7349","id":89749558,"number":7349,"title":"'Home' and 'End' keys do not function as expected on OSX","user":{"login":"dhowe","id":737638,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/737638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhowe","html_url":"https://github.com/dhowe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhowe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhowe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhowe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhowe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhowe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhowe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhowe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhowe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhowe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98445015,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/mac","name":"mac","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":175213356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/question","name":"question","color":"ededed","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2015-06-20T10:14:54Z","updated_at":"2017-03-02T20:55:47Z","closed_at":"2015-06-21T06:44:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Expected behavior in a text-editor on OSX is for the 'home' key and 'end' key to move the cursor to the first and last line of the current file, rather than having no function as is current behavior.
