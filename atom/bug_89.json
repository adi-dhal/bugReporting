Description\r\nFrame rate drops to 2-20 fps, slow to pick up when I start working again: feels sluggish and laggy.

as expected.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nHave gSync enabled in windowed and full screen and open Atom.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Fps to full refresh rate of monitor and high responsiveness.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Frame rates as low as 2-20 fps when idle, slow to pick up when I start working again: feels sluggish and laggy.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    :
