a nice to have feature, 'cause there's a lot of packages that depend on one another, for example, `minimap-git-diff` requires the `minmap` package, and a **lot** of packages require `autocomplete-plus` to work. If the dependent package(s) are not installed, not even a warning is showed to the user to install them.\n\nSo it'd be nice to have An API or something, that allows us to do something like\n\n```\nmodule.exports = MyPackage = \n  activate: ->\n    atom.waitForDeps(['autocomplete-plus', 'minimap']) =>\n      .. load the rest of it\n```\n\nor maybe\n\n```\nmodule.exports = MyPackage = \n  deps: ['autocomplete-plus', 'minimap']\n  activate: ->\n   .. do the stuff\n```\n\nI personally prefer the second one. I initially thought of creating a package for this purpose, but because that means that the packages that load before that package won't have that global variable means that they won't be able to access it and it will also be a bit un-cool.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6013/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6012","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6012/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6012/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6012/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6012","id":62547910,"number":6012,"title":"Uncaught

It's really helpful for identifying wrapped lines, especially for languages like LaTeX where lines tend to be long and frequent editing makes manual hard wrapping needlessly tedious.\n\nExample (adapted from @AlexLog's nicely-done example from Discuss): \n\n``` latex\n\n% Current behavior\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Aaaa aaa aaa aaaaaaa aaaaaa aaaaaa aaaaaa\n    aaa aaaa aaaaaa aaa.\n    \\item Aaaa aaa aaa aaaaaaa aaaaaa aaaaaa aaaaaa\n    aaa aaaa aaaaaa aaa.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n% Proposed behavior with 4-space hanging indent specified\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Aaaa aaa aaa aaaaaaa aaaaaa aaaaaa aaaaaa\n        aaa aaaa aaaaaa aaa.\n    \\item Aaaa aaa aaa aaaaaaa aaaaaa aaaaaa aaaaaa\n        aaa aaaa aaaaaa aaa.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n```\n\nI'd add a variable to the soft wrap indent formula whose value is added to the indent level of the first line. By default, the value could be zero. In the UI, it should be on the `Settings` tab below `Tab Length` and named `Soft Wrap Hanging Indent`. If it uses a dropdown list like `Tab Length`, the options could be the same as the tab length options with the default zero option added.\n\nWhile it could be designed as adding a configurable number of tab stops, it may be simpler to just make it a number of spaces, as there may be people who want a hanging indent level to be distinct from tab stops. Since the default would be zero, any level would have to be configured, so the number of spaces option would be no more configuration effort and more flexible.\n\nRelated discussions:\n\nDiscuss
