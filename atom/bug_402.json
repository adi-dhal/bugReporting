This solves the problem of \"I only want to soft wrap in markdown documents\", \"I need hard tabs for make\", \"I want 2 space tabs for ruby and 4 space tabs for python\", etc. \n### The settings\n\nHere are the settings I plan on scoping:\n\n``` coffee\n# Scoping these is obvious to me\neditor.softTabs\neditor.tabLength\neditor.softWrap\neditor.softWrapAtPreferredLineLength\neditor.showInvisibles\neditor.showIndentGuide\neditor.nonWordCharacters\n\n# Scoping these seems good, but maybe not\neditor.invisibles\neditor.autoIndent\neditor.normalizeIndentOnPaste\n```\n\nLanguage packages will be able to set these settings in their `scoped-properties` cson files. \n\nComment if you have suggestions about settings that should / should not be scoped. \n### User config file format\n\nThe user will also be able to override these settings in their config file. The plan right now is to place all the current settings under a `global` key, then any overridden scoped settings under their scope. Check it:\n\n``` coffee\n'global':\n  'editor':\n    'fontSize': 14\n    'fontFamily': 'monaco'\n    'tabLength': 4\n  'core':\n    'themes': [\n      'atom-light-ui'\n      'atom-light-syntax'\n    ]\n'.source.gfm':\n  'softWrap': true\n'.source.gfm .code':\n  'softWrap': false\n'.source.ruby':\n  'tabLength': 2\n```\n\nIn this example, all languages other than ruby will use 4 space tabs, and ruby will use 2. Additionally, markdown files will be wrapped. One neat thing, because of scoping, is that code blocks in markdown will _not_ be wrapped in this case. \n### Backward compatibility\n\nThe config file will be read in as it is today. It will check for a `global` key, and if not there assume the old format. Upon writing the file back out, it will write out with global config under the `global` key.\n### TODO\n- [x] scope editor.tabLength\n- [x] scope editor.softWrap\n- [x] scope editor.softWrapAtPreferredLineLength\n- [x] scope editor.preferredLineLength\n- [x] scope editor.scrollPastEnd\n- [x] scope editor.showInvisibles\n- [x] scope editor.showIndentGuide\n- [x] scope editor.nonWordCharacters\n- [x] scope editor.invisibles\n- [x] scope editor.autoIndent\n- [x] scope editor.normalizeIndentOnPaste\n- showLineNumbers (punting.

I'm guessing this is Atom refusing to overwrite the existing file, though I couldn't see any errors to that effect in the dev tools.\n\nThe behaviour of not completely clobbering an invalid config is

think that Atom should be saving the current session (All open tabs and their contents as well as the tree view) by default. It is important to note that saving the session should be done not only on exit, but every time changes are made to the files (without the user having to save the file) So the work will persist even after Atom crashes.\n\nIn Sublime you never have to think about what files are open, if you saved last changes, etc. You also never have to worry what happens to your work after crash, you are guaranteed to have it all intact when you open it again. This is very handy and frees you from thinking about trivial things.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3710/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3709","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3709/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3709/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3709/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3709","id":44718818,"number":3709,"title":"Add

and first, thank you so much for your project.\n\nThis problem first appeared in my work project which is unfortunately private. All my files was considered as ignore and appeared in grey in the treeview. I took some time and finally succeed to isolate and reproduce it.\n\nIn a Git project, if a .gitignore from a subdirectory match a path from the root of the project, the treeview will use the rule and ignore the path while it's incorrect. Indeed, Git will not do the same mistake and the `git status` will be different as what Atom show.\n\nYou can easily test on this repository I create to demonstrate the problem:\nhttps://github.com/Swiip/atom-git-tree-test\nThe `test.txt` file inside the src directory should not be displayed grey as it's not ignored in git.\n\nIf it's needed, I tested on a Mac with OSX 10.9.5, Atom 0.134.0, I tried several times to delete cached files and it change nothing.
