In the new version of atom I am having an issues with this function that does not exist in my local version of node 0.11.14\n\n``` bash\n~/g/atom-typescript-tools: /Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Frameworks/Atom\\ Helper.app/Contents/MacOS/Atom\\ Helper\n> process.version\n'v0.11.14'\n> 'asdf'.localeCompare('sd')\nfish: Job 1, '/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Frameworks/Atom\\ Helper.app/Contents/MacOS/Atom\\ Helper' terminated by signal SIGSEGV (Address boundary error)\ndrwxr-xr-x jonathanpark:staff typescript-1.4-update âœ—\n~/g/atom-typescript-tools: node\n> process.version\n'v0.11.14'\n> 'asdf'.localeCompare('sd')\n-18\n```\n\nAs you can see if I open Atom Helper as a node process, run the localeCompare test and it throws a segmentation fault.  In my local node 0.11.14 install it works fine.   I suspect that there is an issue where the localeCompare code utilizes some system library that isn't compiled correctly for my os version.  I am running OSX 10.10 and have not updated to 10.10.1 and the new command line tools yet.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4725/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4724","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4724/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4724/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4724/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4724","id":52569727,"number":4724,"title":"Uncaught
