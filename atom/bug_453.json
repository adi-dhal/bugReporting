You can check this by altering the `.tree-view-resizer .tree-view-resize-handle` style. By changing the cursor to `pointer` or `all-scroll` we can get some form of cursor when resizing.\n\n![Example of all-scroll cursor](http://i.imgur.com/mXAz5MY.png)\n\nI don't know if this affects the other versions such as the Mac and Linux versions, but a possible fix for the Windows version would be to use the `e-resize` pointer instead of `col-resize` as I have gotten success from that:\n![e-resize example](http://i.imgur.com/CDqzV9o.png)\n\nIf you're looking for what to edit in the dev tools, here's a screenshot:\n![Chrome Dev Tools](http://i.imgur.com/T1k55ta.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2164","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2164/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2164/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2164/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2164","id":33259614,"number":2164,"title":"Fix indenting of HTML tags for instance.
