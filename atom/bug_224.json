This consumes way too much time, while the quick alternative of using the `--resource-path` flag is not obvious to a newcomer.\n\nThe usage of this flag should be documented clearly somewhere where a person going through the build instructions would see it. This can be added individually to the corresponding file for each OS, or described in some separate \"hacking the Atom source\" guide and linked to in said files.\n\nGiven some guidance towards which of these alternatives is preferable, I'm willing to write something up myself.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9085/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9084","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9084/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9084/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9084/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9084","id":110450471,"number":9084,"title":"Retina & Non-retina redraw issue","user":{"login":"zslabs","id":1018402,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1018402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zslabs","html_url":"https://github.com/zslabs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zslabs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zslabs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zslabs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zslabs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zslabs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zslabs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zslabs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zslabs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zslabs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-10-08T13:25:24Z","updated_at":"2015-10-08T13:48:32Z","closed_at":"2015-10-08T13:47:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When waking up my Mac (Retina) that is hooked up to a non-retina external display, the Atom editor only shows about 25% of itself with the rest of the app blank/white.

was a bug in moving lines down. \nThe bug can be reproduced in the following steps:\n- Make a text file with last line blank\n- Select the entire row of third last line\n- Try moving down. It won't move\n\n![output](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10784031/10346678/f98a38b0-6d4d-11e5-817b-91391134443b.gif)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9073/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9072","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9072/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9072/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9072/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9072","id":110279368,"number":9072,"title":"Allow package install/removal from command pallet","user":{"login":"danielmelogpi","id":3124696,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3124696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmelogpi","html_url":"https://github.com/danielmelogpi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmelogpi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmelogpi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmelogpi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmelogpi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmelogpi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmelogpi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmelogpi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmelogpi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmelogpi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true},{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-10-07T17:42:59Z","updated_at":"2015-10-12T13:39:46Z","closed_at":"2015-10-12T13:39:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello, everyone\n\nThis is supposed to be marked as a feature idea.\n There is a feature in Sublime that simplifies plugin/package management very much and I often find myself trying to use on atom: to use the command pallete to remove packages.\nIn fact, in sublime you can also do the installation process via the pallete. The pallete is able to unfold into  \"submenus/suboptions\" to be acessed from there.\nI'd like this also in atom, if it can be considered. I'm also considering developing a plugin for that, but as I'm so out of time these days I decided to share the idea here.\nThanks a bunch for the editor.
