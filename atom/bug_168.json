To be able to do this, I need to know how to get script/build to use local sources instead of trying to download the required sources (like for its node modules, apm packages, _etc._) itself. I'm not a Node.js expert (or even someone with an intermediate knowledge of it) so please, just tell me:\n1. Does script/build have an in-built option that can be passed to it so that it will use local packages instead of downloading them itself? If so what is it?\n2. If not, how do I build Atom using local sources via alternate routes? Preferably in as simple terms as possible.\n\nThanks for your time and

This example creates a file with 150k `#`'s and opens Atom in safe mode. (And make sure soft wrap is disabled?)\n\n``` sh\ndd if=/dev/zero ibs=1k count=150 | tr \"\\000\" \"#\" > hashes.txt\natom --safe hashes.txt\n```\n\nThen click on the empty non-numbered space below the first line. This causes Atom to move the cursor to the end of the long first line. Unfortunately, Atom freezes for about ~30s on my MBP before the cursor move is complete.\n\nClicking anywhere _on_ the line doesn't cause a freeze, nor does navigating with the keyboard. Even pressing the end key moves the cursor to the end of the line instantly.\n\nHere's a profile of that frozen period:\n\n![hashes txt users rahat downloads 2016-02-10 22-26-27](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3174006/12969392/5c795f6e-d045-11e5-987a-d90de690de31.png)\n\nI figure this is different than #979 because the frozen period involves figuring out cursor position and not syntax highlighting, as the profiles in that issue imply.\n\nConfirmed on both Windows 10 and El Capitan on Atom v1.5.1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10769/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10768","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10768/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10768/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10768/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10768","id":132882637,"number":10768,"title":"Temporarily disable deserializers & viewProviders metadata fields","user":{"login":"maxbrunsfeld","id":326587,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/326587?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld","html_url":"https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-02-11T04:07:15Z","updated_at":"2016-02-11T18:20:18Z","closed_at":"2016-02-11T18:20:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/10768","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10768","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10768.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10768.patch"},"body":"See https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10764\n\nAfter merging the above PR in master, I'd like to avoid waiting for v1.7.0 to be released before I can merge PRs that update packages to use the new deserializer and view-provider APIs. I can change the packages in a backwards-compatible way, but I need to temporarily remove the logic that I added in https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9687 for handling the slightly-different API that I had introduced previously.\n\nThis should be pretty risk-free, since it just removes calls to some methods that I recently added. Once it goes :green_heart:, my intent is to merge it directly into stable and publish a new patch release, just to unblock continuing efforts to use the improved APIs.\n\n/cc
