is an experimental spike of an alternate GitRepository class that uses [nodegit](http://www.nodegit.org/) rather than [git-utils](https://github.com/atom/git-utils). We would love to speed up the responsiveness of various aspects of Atom (tree-view, etc) by doing more Git operations asynchronously, and it would also be nice to get out of the business of maintaining our own libgit2 wrapper.\n\nHere are a few notes about the reasoning behind some decisions here:\n- It follows the existing GitRepository API closely, changing everything sync to Promise-based async.\n  - The assumption is that having a close mapping between the sync and aysnc APIs will make it less painful to refactor client packages.\n  - I'm not 100% sure we should keep this design, so it's a tradeoff between design quality and incurred labor. Ideally we'll keep this private and experimental all the way until Atom 2.0 so that we can change it as we need to.\n- The class is written in ES6, because Coffeescript, while lovely, is the past, and the community seems to have consensus on transpilers like babel.\n  - This includes an .eslintrc, because I've found it extremely useful.\n  - The spec is still in coffee because I thought it might be easier to just modify it as I go to make sure I had the same coverage on both classes, though at the moment I wish I'd run it through a coffee -> js converter first.\n- I haven't done a lot of ES6 or constructed a Promise-based API for anything serious before, so I'm sure to misuse some APIs.\n- We'll need to keep the sync GitRepository class around for backwards compat, so I haven't decided quite how to integrate this with the current provider system.\n  - Perhaps we add a private method on the sync repo like `GitRepository.async` that returns the Promise for an async repo, so that internal callers can use async without changing anything in the `GitRepositoryProvider`?\n- Documentation is sparse because I wasn't sure this was a good path to follow until today. I'll flesh it out more as I go.\n\ncc @atom/core @orderedlist \n- [ ] Determine a good test case (even if manual / subjective) for git-related UI responsiveness\n  - many simultaneous changes, check

Based on a test of searching for the `e` character in `jquery.js` that took 2932ms, the biggest bottlenecks as follows:\n- 670ms ~20% – Creating and subscribing to individual decorations for each result.\n- 1752ms 60% – Creating markers, of which:\n  - 893ms – Inserting markers into current marker index.\n  - 533ms – Propagating marker creation events\n- 125ms ~4% – Translating character offsets to rows and columns.\n\nBased on discussion with @maxbrunsfeld and @as-cii, this is a proposal for changes to core APIs that attacks these bottlenecks directly.\n## Marker Layers\n\n`TextBuffer.prototype.addMarkerLayer` creates and returns a `MarkerLayer` object that represents a set of markers.\n### Creating Markers\n\nThis object has a `markRange` method that takes a 2D rows, column range as normal, but it also has a `markCharacterIndexRange` that will eliminate the need to translate character indices to points during our scan. Both marker creation methods return an integer id instead of an object, which can be passed to `getMarker` to retrieve the actual marker object for direct manipulation. Working in terms of ids rather than objects saves us from allocating large quantities of what are essentially \"convenience\" objects until they are needed. We could potentially avoid the need to _ever_ allocate marker objects by manipulating individual markers via methods on `MarkerLayer` that take an id, such as `updateMarkerRange(id, range)` or `destroyMarker(id)`. However, this may interact poorly with existing APIs and would need to be carefully considered.\n### Observing Updates\n\n`MarkerLayer`s will also have an asynchronous, batch-oriented change subscription function called `onUpdate`. For more information on our need to transition asynchronous events in the model and the naming scheme that could facilitate this transition, see #9207.\n\nSubscribers to `onUpdate` will be called once for any number of marker changes occurring in a given tick of the event loop. If needed, we can emit an event object containing arrays of `created`, `updated`, and `destroyed` marker ids, but since the view re-queries the marker index anyway during render, we may want to wait until we have a use case. I do however have a feeling that subscribers could be interested in this information.\n## Decorating Marker Layers\n\nTo avoid the overhead of creating and subscribing to thousands of decorations, we can add `TextEditor::decorateMarkerLayer` that accepts a marker layer along with a decoration descriptor object that should apply to every range in that layer. This will allow us to create and decorate the search results layer _once_, and from then on just manipulate markers.\n## Other Methods\n\nMarkers created via `TextBuffer`'s existing `markRange` method will be created in a default marker layer, which can be accessed via `TextBuffer.prototype.getDefaultMarkerLayer`. Otherwise, I don't think we need to provide accessors or observation methods for marker layers, as they can be explicitly passed to functions that need them.\n\nFinally, `MarkerLayer` will need the utility methods `clear` and `destroy`.\n## Creating markers in the background\n\nFinally, if the overhead of inserting markers into the index is still too slow using the new 1D marker index and avoiding the overhead of synchronous events, we're going to need to populate it in the background. This would add two complementary methods to the `MarkerLayer`, `serialize` and `deserialize`. They would delegate through to our marker index object, which we could construct directly in the `scandal` background process and then serialize to be populated into a highlighted marker layer after the scan completed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9208/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9207","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9207/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9207/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9207/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9207","id":112051804,"number":9207,"title":"Proposal: Model change observation should be batch-oriented and asynchronous","user":{"login":"nathansobo","id":1789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo","html_url":"https://github.com/nathansobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":118249520,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/api","name":"api","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":52925411,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/performance","name":"performance","color":"d4c5f9","default":false},{"id":274751644,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/proposal","name":"proposal","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-10-19T00:10:41Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T20:09:33Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T20:09:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We've gained a lot of performance in Atom by switching from processing events synchronously and one-at-a-time, to processing events asynchronously and in batches.\n## Asynchrony and batching in the view layer\n\nOriginally, we mapped individual changes to the editor model directly to individual updates to the DOM, synchronously.\n\nNow, when the text editor model changes, we schedule an asynchronous batched update of the view on the next animation frame. We write this view update as a straightforward function of the underlying data model, adding indexes to the model where necessary to ensure we can recompute the view efficiently.\n\nAn asynchronous approach means that model updates have very predictable performance. For any given operation, we update a small chunk of essential state, along with any indexes, and both of these operations can be made O(log(n)) or better in the size of the essential state of the model. Importantly, these update operations do not synchronously fire event handlers that interact with the DOM, eliminating the risk of a subscriber unexpectedly adding to the cost of a particular update operation. Code that responds to changes is decoupled from code that makes changes, meaning that once we make our operations fast, they will stay that way.\n\nThe cost of updating the view is also easier to reason about in a batched model. We can write a computation that performs predictably, regardless of how many times the model has been updated since the last animation frame. Redundant DOM updates are avoided, and we can reason about the state of the view holistically and declaratively rather than concerning ourselves with the interactions of lots of individual updates.\n## Making all model events asynchronous\n\nSo far, we've really only applied this approach to the view layer, but it makes sense at the model layer as well. Currently, we expose synchronous event hooks all over the system. For example, we emit events when individual text changes are made to the buffer, when individual cursors move, and for each individual change of the active pane. These synchronous events make the cost of model changes open-ended and encourage redundant computation in layers of derived state. For example, commenting out 1000 lines currently causes 1000 individual text changes, each of which is processed through the tokenized buffer and display buffer as a separate event, and that's not even accounting for the cost of third-party event handlers.\n\nThe solution is to make event propagation at the model layer asynchronous and batch-oriented in the same way we've done at the view layer. Instead of events _synchronously_ reporting on _individual_ changes such as `Marker.prototype.onDidUpdate` and `Marker.prototype.onDidDestroy`, events should instead _asynchronously_ describe _groups_ of changes that have occurred within a given frame of time, such as a hypothetical `MarkerLayer.prototype.onUpdate` that emitted events with a list of `created`, `updated`, and `destroyed` markers.\n\nTo achieve and maintain performance in Atom, we need to systematically replace all synchronous event subscription points in the system, starting with the hottest code paths. Highest on my list are Atom's synchronous handling of individual marker events, which degrades the scalability of find and replace, along with our synchronous handling of buffer changes, which causes bad performance in the face of large numbers of text changes.\n## Scheduling model change events\n\nGoing asynchronous means we can deliver change events at any time, so when should we do so? Updating the view is the ultimate goal of most model changes, meaning that the frequency with which we emit change events should be bounded by 60 frames per second, or roughly 16 milliseconds. However, since model-level change events often themselves result in additional model changes, emitting events at a higher frequency will be necessary to allow chained model updates to quiesce before the end of the frame budget. Simply emitting events on `nextTick` may be sufficient.\n## Transitioning to asynchronous model change events\n\nA ton of code has been written against Atom's synchronous model change subscription methods, so dropping them any time soon is pretty much out of the question. New asynchronous APIs will need to be added alongside them, and after we transition bundled packages over we can deprecate the old synchronous versions.\n\nA good way to slot these methods in may be with a shift in our naming. Previously, we adopted the `onDid*` and `onWill*` nomenclature to distinguish events occurring before or after a specific moment in time. Since asynchronous events always occur after, it may make sense to just drop the \"did\" from the name, adopting a scheme like `TextBuffer.prototype.onChange` or `TextBuffer.prototype.onUpdateMarkers`. There will be inconsistency during the transition, but eventually only a few `onWill*` special methods that actually allow synchronous cancellation will remain, alongside a host of `on*`

Non-ASCII letters will render in strange ways.\n\nThe problem can be solved if the user changes file encoding manually in the status bar.\n\nI am using Atom 1.0.19 on Windows 10 x64. Let me know if you need any additional information or help with debugging.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9190/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4932","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"C96B:366E:6FF157:EBEB26:59D92A66","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=221>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=219>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"2a3abdd086fd43d4469a49d4bdea22b7\"","status":"200 OK"}}
