What are the popular ones?\n- Looking at code @mark-hahn and @lee-dohm produced recently\n- Looking at other editors. How do they do it? Do they have APIs?\n- Are there autocomplete daemons out there we can use (e.g. https://github.com/nsf/gocode for Go)\n\nThen I would come up with a plan of attack for the new version. In my mind, we have a couple options:\n- Extend `autocomplete` with an API\n- Take over `autocomplete-plus` with some modifications and API changes\n- Write something completely new\n\nI am not sure what the best way forward is right now. I do feel, though, that the hard part is not the UI that pops up the completion box, it's having great language support, and a nice API for adding completions.\n\nIt would be great if you guys could help me / us work through the research phase. Off the top of my head, I'm thinking these would be a big help:\n- Your opinions and suggestions for the provider API.\n- Your architectural suggestions (I know @mark-hahn wrote one recently)\n- Comments explaining the pitfalls and your frustrations of the current `autocomplete-plus` API. Maybe suggestions on improvements.\n- Links to autocomplete providers for languages (either generic providers or for other editors)\n- Explanations / links to APIs in other editors\n- General autocomplete API related frustrations and desires\n## Resources\n- Discuss thread: https://discuss.atom.io/t/what-can-we-do-to-improve-autocomplete/13001\n- @mark-hahn + @lee-dohm's autocomplete:

To Do:\n- [x] Get build green\n- [ ] Decide on open questions\n- [x] Fix documentation\n## Concerns About Current View Registry\n\nOriginally, the view registry had three main responsibilities:\n- A centralized place to register view providers, which describe how element constructors associate with model constructors.\n- A factory that can create a view for a given model based on the above providers.\n- A 1:1 mapping from models to views that persists for the lifetime of each model.\n\nAfter working with the system and talking with @maxbrunsfeld, I'm very concerned about the pitfalls associated with maintaining a _global_ 1:1 mapping between models and views. Currently, the only way to create a new view with providers is via `atom.views.getView`, which returns an existing view if one already exists. If a user called this method thinking they were creating a new view, but one already existed, they could potentially move the existing DOM node from its previous location on the DOM. Beyond that: are we confident enough that we'll want a 1:1 correspondence between models and views _everywhere_ that we want to force those semantics globally if anyone wants to use our factory?\n## Proposed Changes\n\nIn response to these concerns, this PR separates the view _factory_ functionality from the view _registry_ functionality, meaning you can use the factory to create a view without buying into the 1:1 map. The factory remains global at `atom.views` and has two methods, `::createView` and `::addViewProvider`. The _registry_ is moved inside of WorkspaceElement and is proxied via `WorkspaceElement::getView`.\n\nIf a user wants to get a reference to a particular model's existing view _in the workspace_, then they should call `::getView` on the workspace element. If they want to create a _new view_, then they can use `.createView` on the global factory. This radically reduces the amount of global state we're tracking, making `atom.views` a more reasonable global service. It also discourages people from referencing the view from the model layer since `::getView` can only be accessed if you already have a reference to the view layer.\n## Open Questions\n### Accessing the Workspace Element?\n\nPrior to this PR, it was possible to get a reference to the workspace element with `atom.views.getView(atom.workspace)`. It wasn't a particularly attractive incantation, but at least it was possible. There's now no longer any way to get access to the workspace element short of direct DOM querying:\n\n``` coffee\nworkpaceElement = document.querySelector('atom-workspace')\n```\n\nIt actually reads clearer than accessing it via `atom.views`, but it still feels awkward for some reason to have to pull this off the DOM with a query. One idea is that we could add a `document.workspace` property as a shorthand for querying the selector. We could even automatically create the workspace element when that property is referenced for the first time in specs.\n\nIt seems very much inline with existing shorthand properties such as `document.body` and `document.head`, and since the user would be going through `document` it would emphasize that you are entering DOM territory when you call this. The downside is that we would be adding a non-standard property to the `document` object.\n\nAnother option is `atom.workspaceElement`. Or we just force people to query for it.\n### Clarify The Global Name?\n\nI kinda want to change `atom.views` to `atom.viewFactory`. That will add yet more deprecation warnings for APIs that we've made public as part of the 1.0 freeze effort, but I think long-term clarity could be worth the short-term incremental pain.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4353/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4352","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4352/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4352/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4352/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4352","id":50476195,"number":4352,"title":"high resource usage","user":{"login":"LeoK987","id":6257601,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6257601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoK987","html_url":"https://github.com/LeoK987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoK987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoK987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoK987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoK987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoK987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoK987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoK987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoK987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeoK987/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-11-30T23:55:39Z","updated_at":"2014-12-01T19:42:28Z","closed_at":"2014-12-01T19:42:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have 7 tabs open.

other people have reported, Atom comes with a small font size can only be fixed by editing config files (see #3792). I had the same problem with the Settings GUI. Unfortunately, this is very difficult to fix by editing `styles.less`. In particular, you cannot simply change `@font-size` in your local `styles.less` file. To make Atom usable for me, I had to locate my Atom installation, locate my theme, locate `ui-variables.less` and edit `@font-size` there directly. I still have not managed to get the check buttons to have a reasonable font size.\n\nClearly, fixing the font size is far more difficult than it should be. I ask that you add the UI font size and font family to the settings menu so that people can change them easily.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4342/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4341","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4341/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4341/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4341/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4341","id":50403240,"number":4341,"title":"Add
