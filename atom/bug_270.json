I _disabled_ vim-mode!\")\n\nI would expect that, if a package is disabled, then it's completely unavailable.\n\nFrom https://github.com/gepoch/vim-surround/issues/21#issuecomment-118548512\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7710/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7709","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7709/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7709/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7709/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7709","id":93050543,"number":7709,"title":"Open file from command line with line-column didn't work in Windows","user":{"login":"m0nhawk","id":8220926,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8220926?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/m0nhawk","html_url":"https://github.com/m0nhawk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m0nhawk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m0nhawk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m0nhawk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m0nhawk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m0nhawk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m0nhawk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m0nhawk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m0nhawk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m0nhawk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true},{"id":62363277,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-07-04T21:41:14Z","updated_at":"2015-07-05T11:13:50Z","closed_at":"2015-07-05T06:09:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Opening file from command line with line-column didn't work in Windows (particularly on Windows 8.1 and Atom 1.0.0).\n\nBoth\n\n```\n> atom.cmd article.tex:22:10\n```\n\nand\n\n```\n> atom.cmd \"article.tex:22:10\"\n```\n\nDidn't work as expected, it open the file `article.tex:22:10` and not the `article.tex` on line 22 and column 10.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7708","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7708/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7708/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7708/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7708","id":93045212,"number":7708,"title":"Unsaved changes lost if permission denied when saving on exit","user":{"login":"einarmagnus","id":15872,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/15872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/einarmagnus","html_url":"https://github.com/einarmagnus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/einarmagnus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/einarmagnus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/einarmagnus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/einarmagnus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/einarmagnus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/einarmagnus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/einarmagnus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/einarmagnus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/einarmagnus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":97577987,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/linux","name":"linux","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":15,"created_at":"2015-07-04T20:25:35Z","updated_at":"2016-05-03T00:36:56Z","closed_at":"2016-05-03T00:36:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If I open a file that I do not have permission to save and try to save it I get a popup telling me I lack permissions, e.g. `Unable to save file: permission denied '/etc/hosts'`.

As @jerone put it in https://github.com/atom/settings-view/issues/531:\n\n> Showing the cursor as a \"hand\" when hovering over things in the UI is a very \"web\" oriented convention.\n\nThis will go a long way, I think, toward making Atom feel less like a \"\"\"website\"\"\" running in a semi-headless Chrome, and far more like a native app with a custom UI. :smile: \n\n_Note: This won't affect the styling of any components that explicitly declare another `cursor` type._\n\n> But how will I know I can click on a thing? How will I know if a thing can be interacted with?\n\nHere's how various OSes and desktop shells handle this:\n- **OS X**: Occasionally a hover state, often a thing that looks like a button, but usually no way of knowing other than by clicking on it.\n- **Windows**: Hover states.\n- **GNOME 3**: Hover states.\n- **Ubuntu Unity**: Hover states.\n\nI think the safest bet here is to give actionable elements appropriate hover states as a replacement for `cursor: pointer`.\n\nAlthough this is quite a sweeping change, it doesn't _entirely_ do away with `cursor: pointer` – the pointer should still be used when an element actually is an external link (whether it's an `a` element or not). Ideally this will be combined with https://github.com/atom/status-bar/issues/89 eventually.\n\nTODO:\n- [x] What do we do about actionable text? Right now it'll have a standard link-like underline hover state, but without `cursor: pointer`.\n- [x] ~~We could be more extreme and add an `!important` flag to really discourage use of `cursor: pointer` – thoughts?~~\n- [ ] Ensure that no other Bootstrap classes need overrides\n- [ ] Add `.link-external` class example to styleguide\n- [ ] Add `.link-internal` class example to styleguide\n- [ ] Add `.text-selectable` class example to styleguide\n- [x] Remove all remaining uses of `cursor: pointer` from settings-view (https://github.com/atom/settings-view/pull/575)\n- [ ] Ensure that all actionable status bar tiles have hover states\n  - [ ] Update status bar tile hover states to look less like links (background highlight maybe?)\n- [ ] Communicate this change well so package authors can adapt if need be\n  - [ ] Also encourage package authors to use `cursor: default` + hover state for actionable elements in their packages over `cursor: pointer`\n\n/cc @atom/feedback

IO.js:\n\n```\n> process.version\n'v1.5.1'\n> os.release()\n'6.3.9600'\n```\n\nThe same command run from the Atom developer console:\n\n```\n> process.version\n'v1.5.1'\n> os.release()\n'6.2.9200'\n```\n\nMy Windows release (8.1) as reported by running `ver` and `winver`:\n\n```\nMicrosoft Windows [Version 6.3.9600]\n```\n\nThis bug seems to be related to the embedded manifest file `node.exe.extra.manifest` in Node, and `os.release` use of `GetVersionEx` on Windows.\n\nCan this please be fixed or do I need to use another way of determining the current version of Windows?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7687/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7686","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7686/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7686/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7686/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7686","id":92905384,"number":7686,"title":"Panes:

have been requests for an Emacs-like behavior of `ctrl-x 1` that would close inactive panes and the closest approach is the 'close other items', but it only closes inactive items within the active pane. To that end the tabs module provides a 'close other tabs' function that does exactly the same thing.\n\nThe pane function: 'close other items' could either be omitted or replaced with a 'close other panes' function which would make Emacs users happy.\n\nMultiple items within a pane does not seem to have a purpose without some implementation of tabs. In that case, in my opinion, it should be up to the tabs implementation to provide the 'close other items' feature.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7685","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7685/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7685/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7685/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7685","id":92897340,"number":7685,"title":"Allow

in one window will always change the theme in all windows.\n\nIt would be awesome if you could scope config to dev mode, so you can tailor Atom as needed for your development
