On macOS, however, users can decide to only show scrollbars while scrolling, which causes Atom to detect scrollbars as being invisible during measurements.

This was a workaround that got added back in bac9922 and it's needed in order for scrollbars to be shown properly when the \"Show scrollbars only when scrolling\" setting is on.\r\n* Renaming the `is{Horizontal,Vertical}ScrollbarVisible` functions to `canScroll{Horizontally,Vertically}`, to better express their intent. In fact, if the content is scrollable it doesn't necessarily mean that the scrollbar is also visible.\r\n\r\n/cc: @nathansobo @Ben3eeE @ungb @lee-dohm ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15506/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15505","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15505/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15505/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15505/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15505","id":254020838,"number":15505,"title":"Atom installer runs for ever but won't install","user":{"login":"doofz","id":19177525,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/19177525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doofz","html_url":"https://github.com/doofz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doofz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doofz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doofz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doofz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doofz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doofz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doofz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doofz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doofz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-08-30T14:30:27Z","updated_at":"2017-08-30T16:50:51Z","closed_at":"2017-08-30T16:50:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Good afternoon everybody,\r\n\r\nSo, I already was a Atom user, until it decided just not to open.

I think I have some clues as to what is causing this, based on system calls monitored through SysInternals Process Monitor. The crash is always immediately following a call to \"NtNotifyChangeDirectoryFile\". This call is normally used to allow a process to be notified of changes to a folder, but in some environments this functionality is not supported. In our case, the server is returning \"CANCELLED,\" and presumably the result is not being checked by Atom (or whatever component of Atom is issuing the call).\r\n\r\nNote that NtNotifyChangeDirectory is probably not the call in the code, so it's more likely coming from something like ReadDirectoryChangesW. I'm not really that familiar with Atom yet, but my best guess is that this is getting called from Node.js. In particular, node/deps/uv/src/win/fs-event.c.  I can confirm that the filters being set in that file match what is being passed to NtNotifyChangeDirectoryFile right before my crash.\r\n\r\nHope this is helpful!\r\n\r\nFunction docs for reference.\r\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365465(v=vs.85).aspx\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open Atom\r\n2. Navigate to a file on NAS that does not support remote monitoring.\r\n3. Keep the page active, and wait for the crash.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** The file should remain open with no crash\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Atom crashes, offering to close, reopen, or keep open.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100% in my environment.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom 1.19.4 (fresh install)\r\nAtom 1.20.0-beta5 (fresh install)\r\n\r\nWindows 8.1\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nOur server is a Hitachi HNAS, which is likely to be really hard to replicate. I'm hoping the bug may be self-evident from the code, or perhaps the situation could be reproduced by disabling remote monitoring on a different type of server.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15497/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15496","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15496/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15496/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15496/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15496","id":253800124,"number":15496,"title":"Scroll to center even if line is already visible","user":{"login":"314eter","id":890465,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/890465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/314eter","html_url":"https://github.com/314eter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/314eter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/314eter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/314eter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/314eter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/314eter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/314eter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/314eter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/314eter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/314eter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-08-29T20:51:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-02T21:02:16Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/15496","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15496","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15496.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15496.patch"},"body":"### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nBy removing the check that the `desiredScrollCenter` is not yet between the current `scrollTop` and `scrollBottom`, the scroll is always executed if possible.

Have a document open in Atom, notice the position of the scroll bar\r\n2. Alt+Tab to a window over Atom\r\n3. Scroll down a lot\r\n4. Alt+Tab back to Atom\r\n5. Scroll down\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nThe editor window scrolls down a bit\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\nThe editor windows scrolls by the sum of the scroll amounts in step 3. + 5.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:**\r\n100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nOS: Fedora 26\r\n\r\n`atom --version`\r\nAtom    : 1.19.4\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\n\r\n`gnome-shell --version`\r\nGNOME Shell 3.24.3\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15482/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15481","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15481/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15481/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15481/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15481","id":253538466,"number":15481,"title":"uninstaller to remove all leftovers(clean uninstall tool)[FR] - Windows","user":{"login":"Sibiraj-S","id":20282546,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/20282546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibiraj-S","html_url":"https://github.com/Sibiraj-S","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibiraj-S/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibiraj-S/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibiraj-S/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibiraj-S/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibiraj-S/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibiraj-S/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibiraj-S/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibiraj-S/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sibiraj-S/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-08-29T06:05:39Z","updated_at":"2017-08-29T17:23:17Z","closed_at":"2017-08-29T17:23:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#### Feature Request\r\n\r\nWhy not have an uninstaller for atom separately since the atom doesn't completely uninstall in windows.\r\nA lot of leftovers are left behind.\r\n\r\nMostly while reinstalling atom.
