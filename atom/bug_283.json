This is often not appropriate.\n\nThe most trivial instance would be that 0-width searches don't show up. I've also attempted to port some Sublime Text extensions to Atom over the past couple of days ([APNG example for Firefox users](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/97b96893061473f506d82956066c4de860595e9f/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f636b6d386c356f2e706e67), and [a second for good measure](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/13fcea428dc0584ff4fd4ec703b8551215c116c0/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f667550796547362e706e67)) which also wanted this functionality. This is because they use markers to emulate \"stored\" cursors, which naturally includes empty cursors.\n\nOne related misfeature is that edits that touch the edge of a region are added to the region. In Sublime, they are not, which means that empty regions will stay empty. It's also a more useful behaviour generally. If empty highlights are added to Atom, it's imperative that they (at least optionally) not grow when the text to their side is edited.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7310","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7310/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7310/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7310/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/7310","id":88873084,"number":7310,"title":"Fix

title with fire on it. Did I get your attention?\n\nI want to beg you, dear Atom developers, to reconsider the release date (whenever that is) of 1.0.\nI keep seeing issues/tasks that get their `1.0-roadmap` tag removed or just partially fixed because <i>there is no enough time before 1.0 to properly fix this™</i>.\n\nAtom is still lacking some basic features that even Windows's Notepad has (an piece of software that, arguably, can be called a text editor).\n\nNot supporting this or not implementing properly that in a hypothetical 1.0 release won't cause any good to Atom's reputation, probably won't cause any good to your feelings for your <i>baby</i> either when tens of posts start appearing, right after the 1.0 release, mocking about Atom not having X or Y.\n(`Atom is the new Nano!`, `Atom, nice toy, not that nice editor`, etc... You get it)\n\nI know 1.0 is not supposed to be <b>the</b> final and ultimate editor, but rather a point in time where the API is stable enough to be supported without BC until 2.0. I understand your point. But try to understand what <b>users</b> (not developers) would expect from a 1.0 release (which has been in the oven for quite some time now).\n\nOn the other hand, you left the biggest changes for the very end of the sprint towards 1.0 (that is, all the text-buffer and optimizations you have been doing in the past weeks). Not that I don't trust your skills or all the unit tests you have, but one would wait a prudential amount of time before releasing anything after such a big changes.\n\nFinally, there are quite some issues that, imho, are very important (but post 1.0) and could potentially require big changes (like the char measurement system, related to ligatures in fonts). Not really sure how you're going to deal with those tasks if they require BC. Are you going to release a 2.0 just a few months later after releasing the 1.0? Or are you going to stop those BC (thus not fixing those tasks) for some time?\n\nTL;DR: Don't rush with the release just because you agreed on releasing 1.0 on a specific date. It would be better to delay the release instead of releasing a half-baked thing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7308/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7307","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7307/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7307/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7307/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7307","id":88868985,"number":7307,"title":"Uncaught Exception: The workspace can only contain one instance of item [object Object]","user":{"login":"curtiszimmerman","id":1753955,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1753955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/curtiszimmerman","html_url":"https://github.com/curtiszimmerman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curtiszimmerman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curtiszimmerman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curtiszimmerman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curtiszimmerman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curtiszimmerman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curtiszimmerman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curtiszimmerman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curtiszimmerman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curtiszimmerman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false},{"id":211058624,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/uncaught-exception","name":"uncaught-exception","color":"e11d21","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-06-16T23:50:44Z","updated_at":"2017-07-17T10:39:35Z","closed_at":"2017-07-17T10:39:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Steps to reproduce:\n1.
