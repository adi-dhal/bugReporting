Great job, seriously! :clap: \n\nUnfortunately, #5883 is caused by something different than #5667: if you try to checkout `v0.180` (where the issue originally appeared) you'll find out that the reproducing steps provided by @izuzak won't cause any problem. Therefore, I'd like to apologize with every Atom user for this issue (I am truly sorry if this has caused headaches to you :pray:), because this has been caused by our batching strategy. \n\nWhen there is only one pane, everything goes smoothly and no error occurs. However, when there's more than one (and with some particular packages enabled), our `TextEditorPresenter` goes out-of-sync, thus causing that annoying `No line exists for row #{row}. Last screen row: #{@model.getLastScreenRow()}` error. This happens because:\n- Something change in the underlying buffer\n- `getState` gets called before `updateStartRow` and `updateEndRow` (which would be triggered by a change in the buffer)\n- `updateLinesState` tries to traverse an obsolete row range\n\nFor symmetry with `@updateState`, I opted to simply include `@updateContentDimensions`, `@updateScrollbarDimensions`, `@updateStartRow` and `@updateEndRow` right before performing any change to the actual state in `@getState`. I didn't batch these methods because they are used also by other non-batched operations (see `@updateHighlightState`) and therefore need to be updated every time. On the other hand they are very fast, and it should be quite cheap to call them.\n\nThis should solve once for all any issue that arise from the presenter going out-of-sync with the underlying model because of the async nature of the updates. As a result, I believe that the original issue can be closed as well.\n\nOnce again, sorry if this has caused problems to you!\n\n/cc: @nathansobo \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5903","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5903/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5903/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5903/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5903","id":60308029,"number":5903,"title":"Configurable stylesheets through user-variables.less","user":{"login":"braver","id":2543659,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2543659?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/braver","html_url":"https://github.com/braver","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braver/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braver/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braver/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braver/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braver/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braver/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braver/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braver/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braver/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2015-03-09T07:35:11Z","updated_at":"2017-07-13T14:20:47Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"We were having [this discussion](https://discuss.atom.io/t/how-to-allow-users-to-override-my-packages-less-variables/15243/7?u=braver) and jessegrosjean came up with the idea of a `user-variables.less` file.\n\nThere have been attempts to set Less variables through config and they have failed for various reasons. While config would be preferable for discovery and ease of use, if it doesn't work perhaps there is a another way.\n\nUsers can now overrule styles with their own stylesheet, but that's very limited. It's impossible to change the overall hue of let's say one-dark-ui because those colors are everywhere throughout the stylesheet and the selectors would just be insane. If you can change the variable however, it's just a single number.\n\nThe idea would be to have a user-variables.less file in addition to the syntax-variables and the ui-variables. Theme and package authors can choose where to place the import, thereby maintaining control over which variables can be changed by the user. What can be changed can be communicated in the package's readme. This doesn't change the user stylesheet behaviour and would be added in addition to that stylesheet.\n\nSo while I think we can agree this is not the ideal solution, the ideal solution being unavailable this could be a brilliant compromise that opens up a lot of options.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5903/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5902","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5902/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5902/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5902/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5902","id":60303827,"number":5902,"title":"add
