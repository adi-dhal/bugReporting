Open Atom with an empty file. Make sure soft wrap is disabled.\n2. type a long string on a single line --- your string should exceed the width of the editor viewport.\n3. Press <kbd>End</kbd> or try to scroll (using the scrollbar at the bottom of the editor pane) as far right as you can.\n### Actual results:\n\nIn the case of the end-of-line keyboard shortcut, the cursor does move to the end of the line, but both cursor and end of line content is not visible.\n\nIn the case of the scrollbar, you cannot go past a point which is just before the end of the line. The cursor remains hidden, as does the end of the line.\n### Expected results:\n\nIn the case of the scrollbar event, you should be able to actually read the content at the end of the line, with some appropriate padding.\n\nIn the case of the keyboard commands, you should see both end of line content and the cursor blinking there.\n### Notes:\n- Repeating the `editor:move-to-end-of-screen-line` command one more time does move to the end of the line. I couldn't find a way to achieve this using the scroll bar.\n- This issue was consistently reproducible on OS X.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8342","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8342/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8342/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8342/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8342","id":100528706,"number":8342,"title":"Idea: make restoring from cache easier","user":{"login":"andreis","id":1249760,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1249760?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreis","html_url":"https://github.com/andreis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-08-12T12:13:05Z","updated_at":"2017-08-04T07:01:52Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I have to start by saying that `~/.atom/storage` just saved my ass after I overwrote an untracked file in a project, and I'm very grateful for that!
