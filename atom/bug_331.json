In the current state of Atom, if you have the same file opened in two different tabs and they are scrolled to different positions, when you make a change in, say, the left one then the right one will automatically scroll to the position of the change.

starting from the bottom helps reducing the amount of calls dramatically (moreover, this is how the rest of atom core handles folds traversal, so we win also in consistency :v:).\n\nHowever, this was not enough to have acceptable performance because, for each row in the range, the buffer was traversed back and forth to find folds intersecting such rows. This is unnecessary, since we need only to perform such traversal on `start.row` and `end.row`, and simply destroy anything in between. This would catch any larger fold and the rest of them must be right inside `bufferRange` (outermost rows included). :racehorse: :racehorse: :racehorse: \n\n@nathansobo: I am wondering if we should remove [the previous optimization](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5843); after these changes we save a relatively short amount of time skipping `destroyFoldsIntersectingBufferRange` on `selectAll`.

pointed out on #5791, selecting the whole buffer with many folded lines caused a serious performance degradation. I tracked down the issue to `Selection#selectAll` trying to unfold those lines which contained the selected buffer range. However, since we know in advance that we're going to select the whole text, we can make the clever assumption that everything would be unfolded anyways, thus calling the faster `@editor.unfoldAll` (e.g. faster because it simply scans each line one by one, instead of traversing the buffer back and forth for each line in the selection).\n\nSo, we go from this:\n\n![screen shot 2015-03-04 at 23 49

faster)_\n\nWith this change, `selectAll` on a buffer with many folded lines takes no longer than unfolding everything :racehorse: :racehorse: :racehorse: \n\nClose #5791 \n\n/cc: @nathansobo @izuzak
