On saving a a file e.g. test,js the above code fires once - correct\n2.

Now remove one of the tabs for test.js and save the test.js - above code still fires twice! but one of the calls to textEditor.setCursorBufferPosition gets a stack trace and message `This TextEditor has been destroyed` obviously because the pane no longer exists.\n\nThis all seems a bit flaky to me!
