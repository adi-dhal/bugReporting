Your changes will be lost if you close this item without saving\n\nAnd then the user has to go back to their tree view and re-open the original file.\n\nFor reference, an atomic save is one where, instead of simply rewriting the contents of a file, the original file is moved (like `README.md` -> `README.md~`), and then a new file is written in the original location. Applications such as vim, gedit and qtcreator do this when saving files. In my case, with qtcreator, there is no option to turn this behaviour off.

opening files through the fuzzy finder or searching in project files can take a long time and make Atom slowish when you have folders like `node_modules` and `bower_components` in your project which can get quite large.\n\nA solution is to add these folders to Atom's list of Ignored names. However, this causes them to disappear from the tree view as well, making it impossible to look in them if needed, unless you remove them from the ignored names again.\n\nNeedless to say going back and forth like this is a bit of a hassle, especially when working on different projects where you need frequent access to `node_modules` and others where you don't. I find myself adding and removing `node_modules` from the ignore list at least two or three times a day.\n\nIs there a way to support this use case? Some idea's that come to mind:\n- Exclude files and folders listed in .gitignore from the fuzzy finder / search in files? That way I don't have to add `node_modules` to Atom's ignore list, it will still be accessible in tree view (greyed out), yet it won't slow Atom by searching in those folders.\n- Have a separate ignore list for the search / fuzzy file opener? That way `node_modules` can be visible in Atom, but search and fuzzy file opener will be able to ignore it.\n- A toggle option to \"view ignored files/folders\"? They will be displayed in the tree view (greyed out) when toggled, but all other functionality remains the same (e.g. they are not included in the search).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7513/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7512","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7512/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7512/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7512/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7512","id":91620722,"number":7512,"title":"Uncaught

\n\nI know I could go about this with a pull request but it's only a single word addition to the Linux.md file so I felt a developer with write permissions to the GitHub repo could just read this and make the change. At the moment the Linux.md file reads this in its Arch Linux dependency installation instructions:\n\n> - `sudo pacman -S gconf base-devel git nodejs libgnome-keyring python2`\n> - `export PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2` before building Atom.\n\nThe amendment I propose is to add `npm` after `nodejs` in the first of these lines, in accordance with the [official Nodejs Wiki installation instructions](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager#arch-linux). I have tested this on a 32 bit Manjaro Linux Virtual Machine (which is as close to Arch that I can effectively work with-- Arch is over my head): without `npm` in this line, later during the actual build `script/build` generated errors stating that it could not find npm. \n\nI hope this helps,\nBrenton\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7510","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7510/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7510/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7510/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7510","id":91613032,"number":7510,"title":"OSX: `atom` shell command always moves one desktop to the left","user":{"login":"aleclarson","id":1925840,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1925840?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleclarson","html_url":"https://github.com/aleclarson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleclarson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleclarson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleclarson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleclarson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleclarson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleclarson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleclarson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleclarson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleclarson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98445015,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/mac","name":"mac","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":171329633,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-reproduction","name":"needs-reproduction","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-06-28T16:18:45Z","updated_at":"2017-09-23T19:28:44Z","closed_at":"2017-09-23T19:28:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"``` sh\natom ~/.bashrc\n```\n\nInstead of focusing on the Atom editor (as expected), it always focuses on the desktop to the left of the selected desktop (even if Atom isn't on that desktop).\n\nHas anyone else experienced this?
