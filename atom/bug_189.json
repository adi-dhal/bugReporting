All (all I have seen) modern applications built with up-to-date versions of the GTK+ toolkit seem to be compatible with it OOTB, some (like Mozilla Firefox) require extensions of their own to support this. Atom works just fine with the same functionality in Mac OS X (and, perhaps, in the original Ubuntu, but I had no opportunity to check) - this suggests that the modification required to introduce XFCE support is going to be rather humble. As far as I understand the technology [meant to be] behind this feature is what is called the dbusmenu protocol.
