There'll be a corresponding PR in atom/about for the UI.\n\nThe general idea is that the `AutoUpdateManager` which runs on the main thread will pass on events from the auto updater in Electron (or whatever needs to manage update checking in the future) corresponding with the update lifecycle - checking, available, not available, downloading, downloaded - to the renderer over IPC, the app delegate will proxy them, and then the Update wrapper (available at `atom.update`) will bind to the delegate and proxy them for clients (such as the about package)\n\n---\n\nEdit from @benogle:\n\nPreviously there was just an `update-available` and a `update-not-available` event. Respectively, these meant \"there is an update, it's been downloaded and it's ready to install\", and \"atom is up to date\". The only one exposed was `update-available` via `atom.onUpdateAvailable`. We needed more granularity for atom/about#12, so now there are more events.\n\nThis change adds a renderer process `AutoUpdateManager` which is hanging off of `atom.autoUpdater`. The events it supports are:\n\n``` js\nonDidBeginCheckingForUpdate(callback)\nonDidBeginDownloadingUpdate(callback)\nonDidCompleteDownloadingUpdate(callback)\nonUpdateNotAvailable(callback)\n```\n\nThis is probably an 80% point to something cleanish regarding update code. The underlying AutoUpdateManager still emits `update-available` events when the entire update has been downloaded. I was worried about breaking things, so that work can be done as a separate effort. These event names should be changed and `atom.onUpdateAvailable` deprecated in favor of events on `atom.autoUpdater`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10674","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10674/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10674/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10674/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10674","id":131209723,"number":10674,"title":"At

Because of this, even though the two releases have distinct file names (`Atom.app`, `Atom Beta.app`), parts of OS X can't differentiate between the two apps. \n\nIn particular, only one of the two apps will ever show up in OS X's Launchpad (among other oddities relating to opening files from Finder, setting default file associations, and so on).\n\n**Suggested behavior**\n\nBeta channel releases should have a `CFBundleIdentifier` distinct from stable channel releases, e.g. `com.github.atom-beta`. (It might also be useful to change the identifiers of bundled apps, like `Atom Helper.app`, but I can't personally speak to this one way or another.)\n\nWhen I manually made this change, I saw both \"Atom\" and \"Atom Beta\" appear in Launchpad simultaneously.

struggling to remember why Atom originally built to a temp folder but this pull request changes the default build directory to be inside the repository at `out/` instead of `$TMPDIR/atom-build`.\n\nThis should make it easier to access the build once it completes when you are building but not installing since you'll be able to just do `open out/Atom.app` on Mac or `.\\out\\Atom\\atom.exe` on Windows.\n\nThe reason I am making this change now is that AppVeyor's artifact upload system requires your artifacts be inside your project folder which got me thinking why Atom didn't follow that pattern like many other projects do like Node, Electron, etc.\n\n/cc @atom/feedback
