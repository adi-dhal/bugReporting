https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen soft wrap is enabled, resizing the window with a long file causes your current position in the file to be lost. This is because Atom seems to keep the viewport at a fixed position from the top of the file during a resize, causing the file content to be pushed down (by the addition of new soft wrap lines) and your current position in the file being lost.\r\n\r\nWhy is this feature important? Here are two common use cases where this issue occurs:\r\n\r\n- Opening/closing a vertical split\r\n- Toggling the tree view\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Enable soft wrapping (`preferences -> editor -> soft wrap`)\r\n2. Open a long file and navigate to a position a decent way down the file (in my example below the file is 1000 lines long and I have the cursor on line 878)\r\n3. Resize the window and observe your current position in the file being pushed down below the viewport\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\n\r\nWhen a tab is resized, your current position in the file should stay visible within the viewport instead of being push down below the viewport due to the addition of soft tab lines.\r\n\r\nThis expected behaviour is the default behaviour in both VS Code and in Vim (maybe in other editors as well, they are the only two I tested).\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the expected behaviour, in VS Code:\r\n\r\n![gif_vscode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3773641/31256183-a5f9b176-aa7c-11e7-9b96-7793a05ac7e9.gif)\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\n\r\nWhen a tab is resized, the current position in the file is pushed down below the viewport by the extra soft wrapped lines being added to the file. This results in you losing your place in a file everytime you open a vertical split, toggle the tree view, etc.  Here is an example of this, using the same file and line number from the VS Code example above:\r\n\r\n![gif_atom](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3773641/31256196-b3106ecc-aa7c-11e7-8eea-0cac38d5b8b0.gif)\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\n\r\n100% of the time this is reproducable\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\napm: 1.18.5\r\n Atom: 1.21.0 \r\nOS: MacOS Sierra 10.12.3 \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15830/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15829","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15829/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15829/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15829/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15829","id":263271704,"number":15829,"title":"Highlight is out of alignment with cursor and text positions","user":{"login":"pbarbiero","id":20247733,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/20247733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbarbiero","html_url":"https://github.com/pbarbiero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbarbiero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbarbiero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbarbiero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbarbiero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbarbiero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbarbiero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbarbiero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbarbiero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbarbiero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":418477269,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/regression","name":"regression","color":"b60205","default":false},{"id":505038679,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-10-05T21:26:12Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T23:20:52Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

This may happen if there are many soft-wraps and the display layer hasn't indexed the entire contents of the buffer. \r\n\r\nIn that circumstance, if a user attempts to scroll to a position that does not exist, we are unable to clip it correctly in `setScrollTop` because the line count approximation is also wrong. Therefore, after populating the spatial index in `updateSyncBeforeMeasuringContent`, we will make sure that the approximate screen line count did not change. If it did, we need to clear the derived dimensions cache (which contains, for example, the rendered row range) because it could contain incorrect values.\r\n\r\n/cc: @nathansobo @Ben3eeE @ungb @rsese","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15821/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15820","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15820/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15820/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15820/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15820","id":263050097,"number":15820,"title":"open file with file manager","user":{"login":"gocarlos","id":1331762,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1331762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gocarlos","html_url":"https://github.com/gocarlos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gocarlos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gocarlos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gocarlos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gocarlos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gocarlos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gocarlos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gocarlos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gocarlos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gocarlos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-10-05T08:58:03Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T08:59:13Z","closed_at":"2017-10-05T08:59:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15820/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15819","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15819/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15819/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15819/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15819","id":262994842,"number":15819,"title":"I can't insert HTMl snippet in PHP and HTML files in Atom 1.22.0.

So I assumed that it notifies me when the file/folder is created.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nOpen the console and try this:\r\n```js\r\nrequire(\"atom\").watchPath(\"/home/lloiser/does-not-exist.md\", {}, (events) => { console.log(events) })\r\n  .then((watcher) => { console.log(watcher) })\r\n  .catch((err) => { console.log(err) })\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nIt should not fail. Additionally it should call the provided callback with a \"created\" event once the file/folder is created.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** \r\n\r\nIt shows the following error in the console:\r\n```\r\nUncaught (in promise) Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, lstat '/home/lloiser/.my-config-file'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's also not possible to catch this error.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:**\r\n\r\n100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nOS: Ubuntu 16.04 and Windows 10\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ atom -v\r\nAtom    : 1.21.0\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\n\r\n$ apm -v\r\napm  1.18.5\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.12\r\ngit 2.7.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nIt happens in this `fs` call, where an `err` is returned that causes the `Uncaught promise` error\r\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/blob/da7fa1f481ac3db2b803df54e1c2f31457b118c3/src/path-watcher.js#L390-L398\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15818/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15817","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15817/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15817/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15817/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15817","id":262927435,"number":15817,"title":"CTRL+Backspace behavior ","user":{"login":"xx999","id":32522459,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/32522459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xx999","html_url":"https://github.com/xx999","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xx999/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xx999/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xx999/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xx999/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xx999/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xx999/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xx999/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xx999/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xx999/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-10-04T20:55:26Z","updated_at":"2017-10-04T21:38:31Z","closed_at":"2017-10-04T21:38:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x ] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nUncomfortable deleting of code.
