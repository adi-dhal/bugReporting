Yes, I have the latest version coz I just dloaded it... \n1. I already had opened a project. Then I went to Menu->Open or right clicked on the doc and tried to open a new atom window.\n2. And it then gave me this error...\n\n**Edit:**\nOkay, I believe i have understood why it was happening, after I dloaded the zip file from atom.io, it extracted the Atom Application in my Downloads folder... I ran an instance of it, and then moved the Atom to Applications... And now since, the old Atom Window was not able to find the Atom Application in the old path, it started throwing an Exception... \n\nThis might not really be a bug, but this should be handled in some other way I believe... \n\nThanks Atom Developers for such a great and cool looking HACKABLE Editor... :)\n\nKeep up the Great Work!!...\n\n---\n\n**Atom Version**: 1.5.4\n**System**: Mac OS X

(I have a UNC/network file open in the project workspace, and every time I open Atom, it freezes before I can do anything.)_\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n  - _I skimmed it, but couldn't see anything relevant other than the debugging guide._\n- [ ] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n  - _Probably not, but I didn't know which repository was most relevant._\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n  - _Yes. I found some that sound similar, such as #2456 and #1766, but neither of them involve Atom completely freezing. They only report Atom performing poorly. In this case, Atom actually freezes/hangs. I've tried leaving it for multiple hours, only to find it still frozen._\n### Description\n\nWhen I leave a network/UNC file (e.g. \"\\host\\share\\folder\\file\") open, Atom eventually freezes. If I leave UNC file open in my project workspace, opening that project again results in Atom freezing as soon as I open it.\n\nI am running Atom on Windows.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open a network/UNC file in Atom.\n2. Edit it and save the file. (Possibly not necessary.)\n3. Leave Atom open for some time.\n4. Return to Atom. Atom will likely have frozen.\n   - Alternatively, close Atom and try re-opening the same Atom project later.\n\n**Expected behavior:** Atom is responsive to user input.\n\n**Actual behavior:** Atom is not responsive to user input. It is frozen/hung.\n\nPlease let me know if I can help profile or investigate this in some way.\n### Versions\n\n```\n> atom --version\n\n1.5.4\n\n> apm --version\napm  1.6.0\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython\ngit 1.9.5.msysgit.0\nvisual studio 2013\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11117","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11117/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11117/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11117/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11117","id":139669596,"number":11117,"title":"Overlapping button and checkbox.

multiple-line find (& replace) to work for multiple files.\n\n**Steps which explain the enhancement**\n1. Press `meta-shift-f`\n2. Enter your desired multiple-line find and replace values\n3. Hit find (or replace/replace all) to complete the appropriate actions across all relevant files\n\n**Current and suggested behavior**\n\nCurrently find (& replace) supports multiple-line entries in the currently open file, however no results will be returned if this is attempted for a multi-file search.\n\nIt would be very valuable to be able to do this... I find myself wishing this behavior was offered more than I would hope.\n\n**Why would the enhancement be useful to most users**\n\nFind & Replace is an invaluable tool in a multitude of scenarios, but one concrete example is when modifying multiple JSON files which contain the same, outdated schema.\n\nIf course this is only _one_ of _many_ possible use cases.\n\n**Atom Version:** 1.5.4\n**OS and Version:** All\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11107/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11106","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11106/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11106/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11106/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11106","id":139411579,"number":11106,"title":"Uncaught Error: spawn /Users/andrewprocter/Library/Application Support/com.github.atom.ShipIt/upd...","user":{"login":"andrewprocter","id":804169,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/804169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewprocter","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewprocter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewprocter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewprocter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewprocter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewprocter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewprocter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewprocter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewprocter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewprocter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewprocter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-03-08T22:22:06Z","updated_at":"2016-03-08T22:33:54Z","closed_at":"2016-03-08T22:33:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"To reproduce:\n1.

not 1.6 beta.\n\nCannot scroll within a React based plugin inside of Atom as of Atom 1.6.0-beta0 through the current beta7.\n\n<img width=\"1079\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-03-08 at 11 04 12 am\"

behavior not found in Atom 1.5:\n\n<img width=\"1277\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-03-08 at 11 04 48 am\"

may have an effect on other plugins as well.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. apm install atom-coderoad\n2. follow basic install directions\n3. Run the app and complete an initial task.\n\n**Expected behavior:** Scrollable, no scroll target issues.\n\n**Actual behavior:** Not scrollable, scroll target effects workspace as well.\n### Versions\n\nIssues occur with Atom 1.6-beta0 ~ 7. No problems in Atom 1.5.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11103","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11103/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11103/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11103/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11103","id":139356769,"number":11103,"title":"Make
