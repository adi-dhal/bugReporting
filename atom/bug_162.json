Note that files can be opened and closed without Atom hanging, it is focusing the active pane that causes the undefined behaviour.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open a minified javascript file\n2. Click on the active pane\n\n**Expected behavior:**\nI expect the cursor to move to where I click on the active pane.\n\n**Actual behavior:**\nAtom hangs, forcing me to ether Force Quit the application or wait until Atom realises it is stuck and then close the application.\n### Versions\n\n``` bash\n$ atom -v\n1.5.3\n$ apm -v\napm  1.6.0\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.11\ngit

Once install completes, open the Unity Launcher. \n4.

Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](https://atom.io/docs/latest/hacking-atom-debugging#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](https://atom.io/docs/latest/hacking-atom-debugging#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](https://atom.io/docs/latest/hacking-atom-debugging)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nCurrently, the chromium `log_level` is not explicitly set. This means that the `log_level` is implicitly `0`, which is the most verbose setting. We should set [1] the `log_level` to a level [2] that suppresses INFO and WARNING messages, at a minimum.\n\n[1] `app.commandLine.appendSwitch 'log-level', '<SOME VALUE HERE>'`\n[2] https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/base/logging.h#292\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Launch atom from the terminal / command line\n2. Observe messages like `[852:0224/093645:WARNING:accelerator_util.cc(118)] Invalid accelerator token: command` and `[2804:0224/093645:ERROR:renderer_main.cc(200)] Running without renderer sandbox`\n\n**Expected behavior:** Show only meaningful log messages when atom is launched from the terminal or command line\n\n**Actual behavior:** Spurious log messages are displayed when atom is launched from the terminal or command line.\n### Versions\n\n<= 1.7.0-dev\n### See Also\n- https://github.com/atom/electron/issues/1905\n-

or Atom run out of file descriptors.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open atom in safe mode (or not in safe mode), and Console.app to keep an eye on things\n2. Open a few Node projects, containing node_modules folders so there are lots of files in the repos\n3. Either you get `kernel: file: table is full` in Console.app or `ENFILE` errors in Atom\n\n**Expected behavior:** Atom should only open the files that it needs, hard to imagine it needs so many that the kernel stutters.\n\n**Actual behavior:** System becomes unstable, needed to reboot\n### Versions\n\nYou can get this information from executing `atom --version` and `apm --version` at the command line.\n\n```\n$ atom --version\n1.5.3\n$ apm --version\napm  1.6.0\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.10\ngit 2.7.0\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10947/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4990","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"AA29:2B9C:6897F9:10A4F22:59D92987","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=163>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=161>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"d3e6e4a914c26605db23070359f05648\"","status":"200 OK"}}
