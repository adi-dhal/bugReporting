figure out why deserialization wasn't working in the rewritten about package (damn you CoffeeScript implicit returns!) – deserializer functions must return an object, but we currently don't provide any feedback to package authors that this is the case. We should either throw an error or log a warning to make this clearer, and also update the docs [here](https://atom.io/docs/api/v1.8.0/DeserializerManager#instance-add) to specify the expected return value of a deserializer.\n### Versions\n\nAtom    : 1.10.0-dev-e8f1591\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12272/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12271","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12271/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12271/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12271/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12271","id":168519166,"number":12271,"title":"Atom crash with low system memory message","user":{"login":"knzudgt","id":15718033,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15718033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knzudgt","html_url":"https://github.com/knzudgt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knzudgt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knzudgt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knzudgt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knzudgt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knzudgt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knzudgt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knzudgt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knzudgt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knzudgt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":153145129,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/crash","name":"crash","color":"e11d21","default":false},{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":171329633,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-reproduction","name":"needs-reproduction","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-07-31T14:01:53Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T19:10:58Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T19:10:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [ ] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n  Not so far, although I am now using Atom in safe mode\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n  Atom 1.8.0\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n\nFor more information on how to write a good [bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) or [enhancement request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\nAtom crashed twice in a week with multiple open tabs during editing of simple text file.\nThe cursor stops responding to commands, then stops blinking, then a warning message appears informing that 'The editor has crashed'.

I found that there is a portable version of Atom to use in the USB sticks (at Sourceforge). I copied the files in ~ .atom folder the respective folder in the USB so that all plugins are available to use for the portable version.\n\nHowever I have encountered problems:\n1. Plugins sometime have filename/path exceed 256 chars. Using explorer copy function doesn't work.\n2. Update of plugins, for both of installed and portable version sometime took too long to complete.\n\nMy question are:\n\nIs there any kind of **_\"enhance proposal\"_** or **standard** to make Atom more convenient in handling components/plugins? For example, all plugin are packed in a zip-based archives so that installation and update of these stuffs become more convenient and faster. It also make disk access faster someway because normally there are too many files in the plugin folder.\n\nThanks!\n\nTN\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12269","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12269/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12269/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12269/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12269","id":168494699,"number":12269,"title":"Atom Install Fail Windows 10","user":{"login":"AddisonNishijima","id":20747298,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/20747298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddisonNishijima","html_url":"https://github.com/AddisonNishijima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddisonNishijima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddisonNishijima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddisonNishijima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddisonNishijima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddisonNishijima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddisonNishijima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddisonNishijima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddisonNishijima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddisonNishijima/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-07-31T00:40:51Z","updated_at":"2016-07-31T01:01:28Z","closed_at":"2016-07-31T01:01:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Been trying to install atom on my Windows 10 laptop and this is the latest error message.
