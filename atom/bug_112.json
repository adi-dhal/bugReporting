request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\nI am looking for a way to set a configuration string to `\"\\n\"` but the way escaping is happening this is impossible to do with the function `atom.config.set`.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open Debug Console\n2. Run this command: `atom.config.set('test1', \"\\n\")`\n3. Run this command: `atom.config.set('test2', \"\\\\n\")`\n4. Run this command: `atom.config.set('test3', \"\\\\\\n\")`\n5. Open config.cson\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n\n```\n\n  test1: '''\n'''\n  test2: \"\\n\"\n  test3: '''\\\n'''\n```\n\n**Actual behavior:**\nThe config is converting `\\n` into multiple new lines as well as indenting them. Trying to escape the `\\` in `\\n` so that it saves as `\\n` will cause the config set to escape both `\\`s. Adding yet another `\\` doesn't make things any better. It indents the double \\ then adds a new line.\n\n```\n\n  test1: '''\n\n\n  '''\n  test2: \"\\\\n\"\n  test3: '''\n    \\\\\n\n  '''\n```\n### Versions\n\nYou can get this information from executing `atom --version` and `apm --version` at the command line. Also, please include the OS and what version of the OS you're running.\n\n```\nAtom    : 1.9.8\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\n```\n\n```\napm  1.10.0\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode
