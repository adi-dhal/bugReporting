The first is `CommandRegistry::onWillDispatch` is undocumented, so does that mean it is either not a part of the public API, or soon to be deprecated? If so then please ignore this proposal. The second question, assuming this method is meant to be public, is doesn't it make sense to have a matching `::onDidDispatch`? I have a particular use case for this event. I'm currently writing a terminal emulator for Atom, and in it I'm defining a special `atom` builtin. It is essentially a small wrapper around `atom.commands.dispatch` that allows a user to send commands directly to atom via the command line. It works great, except that after the command has executed, my input element loses focus. This hook would allow me to do something like:\n\n``` coffeescript\natom.commands.onDidDispatch -> document.querySelector('#quantum-shell-input').focus()\n```\n\nto return focus to my package after the command has executed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5412","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5412/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5412/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5412/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5412","id":56621758,"number":5412,"title":"Atom

I excluded it for the time being and I am using Jasmine's `ConsoleReporter` 'cause it seems to provide almost all functionalities. On the other hand it seems like `apm test` doesn't exit (even when specs have finished) and I suppose it may be related to this; \n- [ ] `TimeReporter`. 2.0 introduced a new way of creating custom reporters and this has to be adapted as well.\n- [ ] Old async specs. I provided some examples (e.g. upgrading some specs) about how Jasmine 2 is supposed to work with asynchronous tests. You can find more information [here](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/issues/526).\n- [ ] Old custom matchers. The syntax has changed for those as well. I updated `vendor/jasmine-jquery.js` to allow some of the matchers to be compatible with the new specification, but there are still a bunch of them which aren't ported yet;\n- [ ] Old spies expectation. Many expectation have changed since 1.3 and now need to be upgraded (`andCallThrough` vs. `and.callThrough`)\n- [ ] `setIncludedTags`. This should filter out some specs as far as I understand, but Jasmine doesn't seem to provide an alternative. Needs further investigation. \n- [ ] `waits(0)`. This served as a way of yielding to the UI thread. `waits` method does not exist anymore, and therefore we need to find another solution.\n- [ ] `setSpecField`. `currentRunner()` method has been deprecated, thus we need to find another solution. I wonder if this is still needed, therefore it would be great if you could provide some feedback :pray:\n- [ ] Suspicious Jasmine initialization. I am not 100% sure the solution below is the best practice to load Jasmine, but I couldn't find any other feasible initialization strategy. Needs investigation but it should be straightforward.\n  \n  ``` coffee\n  Jasmine = require \"jasmine\"\n  window.jasmine = (new Jasmine).jasmine\n  \n  {ConsoleReporter} = require \"jasmine\"\n  ```\n- [ ] Running test via UI. For now I have only used `apm test` to run tests, but we need to make sure that `AtomReporter` works fine as well.\n\nI am sure I left out many other things which are not evident to me (it's my first contribution to Atom, as you may already know), therefore please feel free to leave a comment wherever you find something suspicious so that I can update incrementally this main post to keep track of what's missing.\n### Discussion\n\nAs @thedaniel mentioned on #5354 one of the main concerns of upgrading is to keep package specs working. Quoting his statement:\n\n> All community package specs are written to 1.3 so there would need to be some kind of mechanism to allow a package to opt-in to 2.0 and run 1.3 by default\n\nA possible solution may be to have two separate suites:\n- A jasmine 2 bootstrap, which loads all the specs that are known to be compatible (package owners may tag such specs somehow, maybe a filename suffix or a subdirectory could be sufficient);\n- A jasmine 1.3 bootstrap (the default one), which will load any other spec;\n\nI am still not sure how difficult could it be to make this approach work, but I hope we can discuss about it :smile:\n\n---\n\nI couldn't tackle this all on my own, especially because I cannot contribute to Atom full-time and this is my first contribution. On the other hand I hope this Pull Request can be a good starting point for us to go on and :shipit: !\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5392","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5392/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5392/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5392/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5392","id":56497792,"number":5392,"title":"Make atom.spec.in use grunt variables","user":{"login":"eestrada","id":1664385,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1664385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eestrada","html_url":"https://github.com/eestrada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eestrada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eestrada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eestrada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eestrada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eestrada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eestrada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eestrada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eestrada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eestrada/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-02-04T09:05:14Z","updated_at":"2015-02-04T17:00:49Z","closed_at":"2015-02-04T16:59:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/5392","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5392","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5392.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5392.patch"},"body":":penguin: Now rpms created with grunt will respect the --install-dir flag.
