Description\r\n\r\nI just had an issue where my atom hangs due to a window state that was unstable, which causes it to freeze. Opening new directories of atom works fine, but as soon as I open the same directory, it hangs again. I was able to fix it by running `atom --clear-window-state` , however for non tech savvy users they would have to probably go through a reinstall. Perhaps this could be an option that could appear if a user attempts to re-open atom multiple times with the same directory?\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.18.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.15\r\nChrome

Run 1.18.0 ia32; open project/directory that uses git VCS. *Note: The git repository has been properly initialized long ago and git seamlessly used for the project since then.*\r\n2. The `.git` subdirectory can be seen in the seen in the Treeview - `Project` Tab/Pane. The files/folders have correct colors according to their git VCS state (black/green/dark-orange). The branch name is not displayed in the statusbar, as it used to be in the previous versions of Atom. However, the correct branch name can be seen in statusbar for the very short moment when starting Atom before the Atom's GUI gets fully initialized.\r\n3. The `Create repository` button is present in the `Git` Tab/Pane. After clicking on that button the Error popup appears.\r\n```\r\nUnable to initialize git repository in /home/SOME_PATH_HERE_EDITED/006_sandbox\r\n\r\n/opt/atom/resources/app/node_modules/dugite/git/bin/git: 1:\r\n/opt/atom/resources/app/node_modules/dugite/git/bin/git:\r\nSyntax error: Unterminated quoted string\r\n```\r\n4. The `Git` Tab/Pane is somewhat blank, see screenshot. There definitely are modified-unstaged files in the project folder, also the modified-staged files; these can be seen in system terminal via `git status` command. These files are not displayed in the Git Tab/Pane in the Atom editor. The `Commit` button is disabled. \r\n![atom-git](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22847930/27520461-816770ac-5a0c-11e7-9f63-9d0a5db0999a.png)\r\n*Note: screenshot taken when Atom running in safe-mode.*\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Always. Tested with multiple directories/projects using Git VCS. When Atom is used for the project/directory that actually is not the git repository (`git init` never ran in the directory; `.git` subdirectory not present in the directory), the steps 3 and 4 can also be reproduced in Atom.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n```\r\n$ atom --version\r\nAtom    : 1.18.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.15\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\n$ apm --version\r\napm  1.18.1\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 ia32\r\npython 2.7.12\r\ngit 2.7.4\r\n```\r\nUbuntu 16.04 32-bit\r\nLinux 4.4.0-81-generic i686 GNU/Linux\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\nBecause the issue has not yet been reported, I suspect the issue could be 32-bit related only or very specific.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14889/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14888","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14888/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14888/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14888/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14888","id":238364934,"number":14888,"title":"Error when closing Atom after opening via GitBash","user":{"login":"eicksl","id":29685894,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29685894?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eicksl","html_url":"https://github.com/eicksl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eicksl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eicksl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eicksl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eicksl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eicksl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eicksl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eicksl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eicksl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eicksl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-06-25T07:13:28Z","updated_at":"2017-06-26T17:47:10Z","closed_at":"2017-06-26T17:47:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"If I open Atom with the GitBash shell, then close the Atom window, the shell displays the following error:\r\n\r\n`Attempting to call a function in a renderer window that has been closed or released.
