It's a ground-up rewrite and better in a number of ways, but the biggest feature is the ability to move subdocuments around in the overall document. That requirement was radical enough that the design assumptions in the original Telepath were worth burning to the ground. This branch drops support for collaboration and deletes the replication specs. They were just too far away from the vision of where we're going and too painful to get working on the new Telepath. I'd like to revisit them after improving the health of the View <=> Model <=> Document correspondence.\n\nNow that we're on a solid foundation that supports moves, we can iterate on this new version of Telepath from here on out. I promise no more rewrites :smile_cat:. Once this lands I'm excited to do an optimized, non-replicated solo mode for arrays and see if it saves us some memory on large documents. Then I plan to resume the ideas discussed in

However if you load these packages independently they work fine.\n\nUnfortunately I can't seem to get a backtrace in windbg because chrome/brightray/atom-shell intercepts the crash before the debugger can grab it. So if I run windbg in `-I` mode it never gets opened. \n\nThe other fun thing is that if you run windbg in the mode where it attaches to all child processes and launch atom from within it the crashes stop happening.\n\n@kevinsawicki also notes that, the packages activate just fine if he activates one package per second using setTimeout.\n\n@aroben suggested disabling breakpad as a way to allow windbg to be called but this is starting to get beyond my current windows abilities. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1044","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1044/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1044/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1044/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/1044","id":21769306,"number":1044,"title":"Paths on Windows","user":{"login":"mcolyer","id":1424,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1424?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer","html_url":"https://github.com/mcolyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":62363277,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2013-10-29T16:31:38Z","updated_at":"2013-11-02T00:40:48Z","closed_at":"2013-11-02T00:40:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"## We should always use forward slashes\n\nSo windows accepts forward and backslashes for folder separators.
