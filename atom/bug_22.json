Atom 1.18.0 was fine, but since updating to Atom 1.19.0, if I have a file with unsaved changes and I try to close the tab by middle-clicking on the tab, then a modal pops up (Are you sure you want to close the file without saving?), but I can't click on anything. The cursor doesn't change no matter what I hover over and no clicks register on the modal's buttons or even other (non-Atom) windows. Clicking another window doesn't focus it, bring it to the front, or get any reaction.\r\n\r\nMy computer is still responsive to keyboard inputs, though even if I alt-tab to another window, nothing reacts to my mouse still. I have to press escape on Atom's closing-confirmation modal or otherwise close it before anything reacts to my mouse again.\r\n\r\nIf I close the file tab in any other way (clicking the X button, or pressing ctrl-w), the modal and my mouse work perfectly normal. With little non-web UI experience, I'd guess the issue has to do with some kind of blocking call (like the modal) happening or a lock being hogged improperly during the middle-click event handler.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Be on Ubuntu 16.04 (?)\r\n2. Open Atom, open a file in Atom, and make some changes to the file without saving.\r\n3. Middle-click on the file's tab.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\n\r\nMy mouse to work as usual: for the modal to be clickable, and to have the ability to click on other windows freely even while the modal is still open.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\n\r\nSee description.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\n\r\n100%, tested with safe mode and a new ~/.atom directory too.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ atom --version\r\nAtom    : 1.19.0\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  :

http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\nNote that clearing the state would fix this issue, but the issue should still be fixed in some other way.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCan't open projects from the previous version of Atom Beta\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Install 1.19 beta 7\r\n2. Open a project, some tabs, and the About page (maybe the Settings View too)\r\n3. Update to 1.20 beta 0 automatically (Squirrel should download the update and you need to Restart and Install once it's downloaded)\r\n4. Reopen Atom once the update completes (the error should happen automatically)\r\n5. If the error doesn't appear, open a project from `File > Reopen Project`\r\n\r\nNote that if you manually add a project with `Add Project Folder` or open a project you had already opened in 1.20 the issue doesn't appear\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Projects should open in tree view and tabs should be restored\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Instead, the error pop-ups and no editor is opened\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Always\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nThis happened when updating to 1.20.0 beta0 on Windows 10 x64\r\n\r\n```\r\n> apm --version\r\n\r\napm  1.18.3\r\nnpm

Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open [this file](https://github.com/calebmeyer/git-links/blob/f5100a252734bc4b4de55dcc4b85b743d456d551/lib/git-links.coffee)\r\n1.

Run `editor:fold-at-indent-level-2` using the command palette\r\n\r\nSize of the Atom window may be related /cc: https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15190#issuecomment-322209970\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nEach element at the second level of indentation is folded, and shows as folded\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\nSome (or none) of the elements are showing as folded.\r\nMoving the cursor with the arrow keys navigates inside the fold\r\nMoving the cursor with vim-mode-plus `hjkl` navigates over the fold\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:**\r\nI am able to see the problem in safe mode about 80% of the time. Almost always, at least one fold gets folded correctly, sometimes two. Very rarely all folds will show correctly.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nWindows 10 creator's update\r\n`atom --version`\r\nAtom    : 1.19.0\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\n`apm --version`\r\napm  1.18.2\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.13\r\ngit 2.13.0.windows.1\r\nvisual studio 2015\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\nScreenshots:\r\nMy configuration:\r\n![mine](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3342777/29088025-8273c790-7c3d-11e7-9744-4fda97adbe34.png)\r\n\r\nSafe Mode\r\n![safe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3342777/29088034-89210670-7c3d-11e7-8fa7-8d14888a8c93.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15190/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15189","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15189/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15189/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15189/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15189","id":248770980,"number":15189,"title":"key-mappings with `alt` don't suppress Mac OS composition characters anymore (atom-1.19)","user":{"login":"despairblue","id":927609,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/927609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/despairblue","html_url":"https://github.com/despairblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/despairblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/despairblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/despairblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/despairblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/despairblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/despairblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/despairblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/despairblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/despairblue/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98445015,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/mac","name":"mac","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":418477269,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/regression","name":"regression","color":"b60205","default":false},{"id":505038679,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2017-08-08T16:20:08Z","updated_at":"2017-08-15T16:13:41Z","closed_at":"2017-08-15T16:13:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

decoration node is re-rendered in it's lifetime which cause keyframe animation unwillingly re-started.\r\nThis was not issue in v1.18 where highlight decoration node was stable in it's lifetime.\r\n\r\nSee, each removal of brackets-matcher's highlight cause fadeout animation re-started.\r\nWhich is because highlight node of `class=t9md-test-flash` is re-created at that timing.\r\n\r\n![decoration-node-unstable2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/155205/29040638-b6cee3ce-7bea-11e7-9aa3-4168238b2b6d.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nWhen highlight decoration is created by `editor.decorateMarker`, corresponding `<div class=\"highlights\">` node is created at top of LinesComponents.\r\nChild nodes of this div represent actual decoration style.\r\n\r\n- Till v1.18 these nodes are stable in its lifetime.\r\n- From v1.19 with new editor-rendering, these nodes can be re-rendered during it's lifetime.\r\n\r\nThis is not problem when highlight class is simply set `background:` color.\r\nBut it's become problem when highlight class specify animation.\r\nLets' say\r\n\r\n- I have set decoration which `class=flash-anime` which will be destroyed after 1.0 sec\r\n- `flash-anime` css class have keyframe animation which fadeout flash during 1.0 sec.\r\n- When Atom re-render(re-create) this decoration node within 1.0 sec, it cause re-start fadeout keyframe animation.\r\n- This issue is more likely to happen when brackets-matcher involved, which create/remove decorations and it cause existing highlight node in the same LinesComponents **re-rendered**.\r\n\r\n\r\nGIF: Animation in 10sec is separated into three because of re-render of highlight node.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1611\" alt=\"untitled_

safe-mode.\r\n\r\n1. Prepare sample.txt and custom-style.\r\n\r\n- sample.txt\r\n\r\n`{a: 1}`\r\n\r\n- style.less\r\n\r\n```less\r\n@keyframes t9md-test-animation {\r\n  from { background-color: #5b91c8; }\r\n  to { background-color: transparent; }\r\n}\r\n\r\natom-text-editor .t9md-test-flash .region {\r\n  animation-name: t9md-test-animation;\r\n  animation-fill-mode: forwards;\r\n  animation-duration: 10.0s;\r\n  animation-iteration-count: 1;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Open sample.txt, place cursor at first line.\r\n3. Paste following code in chrome-dev-tools console.\r\n\r\nThis code does.\r\n- highlight inner range of `a: 1`(inner range of curly brackets).\r\n- marker will destroyed after 10sec.\r\n- highlight class is `t9md-test-flash` which fadeout background color in 10sec.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n(function flashreproduceIssue() {\r\n  const editor = atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor()\r\n  const cursorPosition = editor.getCursorBufferPosition()\r\n  const scanRange = editor.bufferRangeForBufferRow(cursorPosition.row)\r\n  editor.scanInBufferRange(/{.*?}/, scanRange, ({range}) => {\r\n    const innerRange = range.translate([0, +1], [0, -1])\r\n    const marker = editor.markBufferRange(innerRange)\r\n    editor.decorateMarker(marker, {type: \"highlight\", class: \"t9md-test-flash\"})\r\n    setTimeout(function () {\r\n      marker.destroy()\r\n      console.log(\"destroyed\");\r\n    }, 10000);\r\n  })\r\n})()\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Within 10sec, move cursor left/right to cause add/remove brackets-macher's highlight.\r\n\r\nAnd see how keyframe animation is re-started because of re-creation of highlight node.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\n\r\nNode used for highlight decoration is stabled(not re-rendered).\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\n\r\nNode used for highlight decoration is re-rendered, cause keyframe animation re-started.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\n\r\n100%.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.19.0-beta7\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI use fadeout flash effect with keyframe animation a lot in [vim-mode-plus](https://atom.io/packages/vim-mode-plus) to give feedback to user.\r\nE.g. when yank inner range of brackets, flash inner bracket range.\r\n\r\nFrom v.1.19 cursor move cause brackets-matcher's highlights add/removal which cause vmp's flash effect re-started unwillingly.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15185/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15184","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15184/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15184/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15184/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15184","id":248435186,"number":15184,"title":"language-java: the \"new\" keyword on the same line as the literal string \":\" breaks syntax hightlighting","user":{"login":"P403n1x87","id":20231758,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/20231758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/P403n1x87","html_url":"https://github.com/P403n1x87","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/P403n1x87/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/P403n1x87/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/P403n1x87/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/P403n1x87/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/P403n1x87/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/P403n1x87/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/P403n1x87/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/P403n1x87/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/P403n1x87/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-08-07T14:48:21Z","updated_at":"2017-08-07T17:56:36Z","closed_at":"2017-08-07T16:58:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

This PR teaches the `TextEditorComponent` to ignore the `paste` event.\r\n\r\nWhen the user performs a middle-mouse click on a tab, we first get the `mousedown` event. In response to that event, we [close the tab and attempt to prevent Chromium's default processing for the event](https://github.com/atom/tabs/blob/ce1d92e0abb669155caa178bb71166b9f16f329a/lib/tab-bar-view.coffee#L416-L418). This prevents Chromium's default processing for the *`mousedown`* event, but then Chromium also fires a *`paste`* event, and that event pastes the clipboard's current content into the newly-focused text editor. 🤦\r\n\r\n#14987 removed some of the middle-button mouse click handling related to pasting on Linux. This PR restores that logic and the related tests. (See `TextEditorComponent::didMouseDownOnContent(event)`.) With that change in place, since Atom already has its own logic for handling pasting, we shouldn't need to handle browser `paste` events. By ignoring the browser `paste` events on Linux, this PR fixes atom/tabs#461.\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] Fix atom/tabs#461\r\n- [x] Add test for `TextEditorComponent::didPaste(event)`\r\n- [x] Address TODO in `TextEditorComponent::didPaste(event)` (https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15183#discussion_r131672090)\r\n\r\n### Test plan\r\n\r\n- [x] Test on Ubuntu:\r\n  - [x] Verify fix for https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/461\r\n  - [x] Verify the previous fix for https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8648 is still intact\r\n- [x] Test on macOS: Verify that the ctrl-click behavior fixed in https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14987 is still intact\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15183/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15182","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15182/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15182/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15182/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15182","id":248403279,"number":15182,"title":"unexpected crash","user":{"login":"cale312","id":24386876,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/24386876?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cale312","html_url":"https://github.com/cale312","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cale312/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cale312/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cale312/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cale312/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cale312/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cale312/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cale312/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cale312/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cale312/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-08-07T12:57:40Z","updated_at":"2017-08-07T12:57:57Z","closed_at":"2017-08-07T12:57:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?
