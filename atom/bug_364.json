When I get this now it's paired with a second error:\n\n```\nUncaught TypeError: Unable to watch path\nUncaught ReferenceError: spawnSync is not defined\n```\n\n(See bottom for detailed version.)\n\nThe details about my situation:\n\nAtom (currently 0.153.0), no packages installed, running on Windows 7 x64.\n\nAtom will run fine for some amount of time, then I try to open a file and get this error. It doesn't seem to be related to renaming files, as in some of the other reports. At least sometimes I can still open a file in a different window. At least sometimes I can open a file in the same window with a different path. For example, I'm often loading files from a samba share running on Ubuntu 12, e.g.\n\n`\\\\server\\share\\somedir\\somefile`\n\nWhen the problem strikes I don't seem to be able to load any more files from `\\\\server\\share\\somedir` in the same window. But if I map a drive to the same share, I seem to be able to load files from there, e.g.:\n\n`Z:\\somedir\\somefile`\n\nI've already tried setting `fs.inotify.max_user_watches` to `32768` (on the Ubuntu system) as suggested in #2082 and the problem persists.\n\n```\nUncaught TypeError: Unable to watch path c:\\Program Files (x86)\\GitHub
