I reload Atom with a file opened that triggered a scrollbar, native Chromium scrollbars will appear until another file/tab has been used. For Windows, it only appears to be the vertical scrollbar. In Ubuntu also the horizontal scrollbar loses styling. \n\n![atom-scrollbar](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8148535/4965025/aca0ad0c-6779-11e4-817b-597338fef281.gif)\n\nSeems similar to #4090, but this is without shadow DOM enabled, and also happens when using `atom --safe`. Also no errors in the console.\n### Steps to reproduce\n1. Open a long file in Atom that causes a scrollbar to appear\n2. Choose View > Reload\n### Details\n\nTheme: Atom Dark\nSafe mode: verified\nAtom version:\n- 0.144.0 on Windows 8.1 x64, not using Chocolatey\n- 0.142.0 on Ubuntu 14.10\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4106","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4106/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4106/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4106/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4106","id":48168475,"number":4106,"title":"Text selection regression","user":{"login":"superlukas","id":516484,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/516484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/superlukas","html_url":"https://github.com/superlukas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superlukas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superlukas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superlukas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superlukas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superlukas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superlukas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superlukas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superlukas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superlukas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-11-08T15:13:28Z","updated_at":"2014-11-08T16:37:13Z","closed_at":"2014-11-08T16:37:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm not sure whether this is a bug or a feature, but it _feels_ wrong.
