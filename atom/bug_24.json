commands should be able to reference arbitrary metadata, along with a human-written displayName and a description of what to expect when a command is executed.\r\n\r\nThis way, tools like the command palette could surface something potentially friendlier than the `_.humanizeEventName` version of the name string of the command, which is more of an implementation detail.\r\n\r\nPotential arbitrary metadata could be keywords (which could or could not surface themselves in search results), aliases, search weight, etc.\r\n\r\nIt's possible to retain and simply augment the existing command registration API by supporting a complex object everywhere a callback function might be expected:\r\n\r\n```js\r\natom.commands.add(\r\n  'atom-text-editor', \r\n  'user:insert-date',\r\n  {\r\n    displayName: 'Insert a really awesome date',\r\n    description: 'Whereever your cursor is, it inserts the current date!',\r\n    keywords: ['timestamp', 'time', 'today', 'now'],\r\n    aliases: ['user:insert-now'],\r\n    callback(e) {\r\n      const editor = this.getModel();\r\n      editor.insertText(new Date().toLocaleString());\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n  true // throwOnInvalidSelector\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```js\r\natom.commands.add(\r\n  'atom-text-editor', \r\n  {\r\n    'user:insert-date': {\r\n      displayName: 'Insert a really awesome date',\r\n      description: 'Whereever your cursor is, it inserts the current date!',\r\n      callback(e) {\r\n        const editor = this.getModel();\r\n        editor.insertText(new Date().toLocaleString());\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n    'user:some-other-command': {\r\n      displayName: 'Does something really cool',\r\n      description: 'Really, it\\'s super awesome',\r\n      callback(e) {\r\n        editor = this.getModel();\r\n        editor.insertText('yay!');\r\n      },\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  true // throwOnInvalidSelector\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not 100% of whether this metadata should be declared at registration time, and what the consequences are for the same command name registered multiple times with different targets (something I assume from looking at the api is supported?).\r\n\r\nAnother thought I had was either declaratively defining this metadata in `package.json`, or registering metadata bound to command names separately, in the same way keybindings are decoupled from commands:\r\n\r\n```js\r\natom.commands.register({\r\n  'user:insert-date': {\r\n      displayName: 'Insert a really awesome date',\r\n      description: 'Whereever your cursor is, it inserts the current date!',\r\n      keywords: ['timestamp', 'time', 'today', 'now'],\r\n      aliases: ['user:insert-now'],\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc @matthewwithanm

Description of the Change\r\n\r\nAdd new methods to Pane which allows user to move pane to topmost/bottommost/leftmost/rightmost position.\r\n\r\n![pane-move-to-very-xxx](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/155205/28751602-08bea12e-7547-11e7-9c51-4e5569d57293.gif)\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nThis feature can be implemented at `PaneContainer` or `PaneAxis`'s methods.\r\nI think implementing as Pane's method is natural, was not evaluating alternate approach.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nI've maintained this feature as part of [paner](https://github.com/t9md/atom-paner) package's feature.\r\nAnd also copied this feature into [vim-mode-plus](https://atom.io/packages/vim-mode-plus) recently.\r\n\r\nBut supporting this feature from outside of atom-core is a bit awkward, and my paner package have been broken several times on minor update of Atom-core.\r\nSo paner pakage was remain broke in sometime then fixed then broken loop in it's life.\r\n\r\nI think this feature is supported and maintained in Atom-core.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nAll atom user have power to manipulate pane-layout with keyboard.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n\r\n- [ ] Default keymap\r\n  - [ ] macOS\r\n  - [ ] Linux\r\n  - [ ] Windows\r\n- [ ] Command name\r\n  - I chose `move-to-very-XXX` naming.\r\n  - But `move-to-topmost`, `move-to-bottommost`, `move-to-leftmost`, `move-to-rightmost` is alternate name I've came up with.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15126","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15126/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15126/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15126/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15126","id":246558489,"number":15126,"title":"Installing
