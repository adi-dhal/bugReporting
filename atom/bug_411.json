a look at the browser process startup time.\n\nThis is the time between when atom-shell require's Atom's [main](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/d8be03850bb39f2b8472261fb47c610bbdfb509c/src/browser/main.coffee#L1) file and the [first window is created](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/d8be03850bb39f2b8472261fb47c610bbdfb509c/src/browser/main.coffee#L51).\n\nThis includes the time taken to parse the command line arguments, create the native windows, setup the crash reporter, setup the system menus, and start the auto updater.\n\nThis does not include the time take to reopen editors, show the tree view, or anything that happens inside the opened window, just everything between app launch and when the window is created.\n\nI added a new benchmark that starts the app 10 times and averages the app startup time.\n### Before\n\n```\nStartup Runs: 10\nFirst run time: 180ms\nMax time: 196ms\nMin time: 173ms\nAverage time: 181ms\n```\n### After\n\n```\nStartup Runs: 10\nFirst run time: 138ms\nMax time: 138ms\nMin time: 117ms\nAverage time: 121ms\n```\n\nThis is on a Macbook Pro on OS X 10.8.5 with 2.6 Ghz Intel Core i7 processors and 16 GB of memory.\n\nNote that doing a `new BrowserWindow()` which creates the native window takes roughly `40ms` on my machine so that would be the absolute minimum that we would get these times down to.\n### Running the benchmark\n\nI'd be curious what results other people see so if you want to post your before and after results do the following:\n#### On Mac OS X\n- Pull down this branch\n- Do a `git checkout d7106a6b4` to checkout the commit before the changes were made\n- Run `script/build`\n- Run `benchmark/browser-process-startup.coffee` to see the _before_ results\n- Do a `git checkout ks-lower-browser-process-startup-time` to checkout the latest commit\n- Run `script/build` again\n- Run `benchmark/browser-process-startup.coffee` to see the _after_ results\n#### On Linux/Windows\n- Pull down this branch\n- Do a `git checkout fbeb9ec` to checkout the commit before the changes were made\n- Run `script/build`\n- Run `atom -f .` and look for an output line in the terminal that starts with `App load time:`\n- Quit Atom\n- Do a `git checkout ks-lower-browser-process-startup-time` to checkout the latest commit\n- Run `script/build` again\n- Run `atom -f .` again and look for an output line in the terminal that starts with `App load time:`\n\nThe two times will be the _before_ and _after_ results.\n### What changed\n\nMuch of the time spent on my machine was doing `require`s of lots of files that weren't used until later on or possible never at all, but the requires were at the top of the files and so the first window wasn't being shown until all these requires were complete.\n\nMany of these were moved to be required right before use in response to an event or request from a render process.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3453/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3452","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3452/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3452/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3452/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3452","id":41966941,"number":3452,"title":"autocomplete

Squirrel will start Atom.exe with switches to indicate when installation-events occur (installation, upgrade, and uninstall). Atom needs to handle these events (or just exit if there's nothing to do). Squirrel also starts the app on install with a `--squirrel-firstrun`. Things like setting up app shortcuts and file associations will be done here.\n2. Squirrel gives you an EXE called `update.exe`, which will allow you to update the application, or retrieve information about updates to apply via a JSON object. \n\nIn the build process, there will also be some related tooling work - once the build finishes, we need to do a few things:\n1. Generate a NuSpec file representing the current Atom version (super easy, just a Mustache template)\n2. Run `NuGet.exe pack` to generate the latest app package\n3. Run `Update.exe` to generate an installer as well as delta packages. Update.exe will need to have access to the previous versions of Atom to be able to do this (i.e. we'll have an ongoing \"Releases\" directory that we'll keep updating with new stuff)\n\nThese tasks have to be run on a Windows machine, we can't use Mono because we have to call Windows APIs at the very end. \n## TODO:\n- [ ] Integrate Squirrel event handling into Atom startup code\n- [ ] Implement update backend by shelling to `Update.exe`\n- [ ] Write the automation for generating packages and release directories (#3447)\n- [ ] Pull down the old releases before we run CI so we can get delta updates\n- [ ] Automate posting the releases directory to S3 / CloudFront\n\n/cc @kevinsawicki who would like to subscribe to this
