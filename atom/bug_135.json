Now, to actually look at the code of that function I unfold the line where the function begins by clicking the little `>` arrow to it's left.\n\nThe problem is when functions contain other functions, then all the sub-functions are by default folded too. So to see the full code of the sub-function, I need to manually click and unfold each of them, and possibly the sub-sub-functions too. In a language like OCaml, where it's common coding practice to have many nested `let ... in` structures, this makes it a huge pain to use the folding feature.\n\n**Suggested enhancement**\n\nInstead of toggling between fold and unfold when clicking the arrow, instead cycle through \"fold\", \"unfold\", and \"unfold entire tree\".\n\n**Current and suggested behavior**\n\nCurrently, after a fold-all, my code looks like this:\n\n```\n> def foo(n): ...\n```\n\nIf I click the arrow once, I get:\n\n```\n def foo(n):\n>    def bar():...\n>    def boo():...\n```\n\nAnd to see everything I need to click and unfold `bar` and `boo` manually. Clicking the arrow next to `foo` once more just returns it to the folded state in the first code block above.\n\nInstead, I suggest that clicking the `foo` the second time produces this instead:\n\n```\n def foo(n):\n     def bar():\n         pass\n     def boo():\n         pass\n```\n\n**Why would the enhancement be useful to most users**\n\nIt would save users of languages like Ocaml many clicks, and they'd be able to easily see the entire code of a function.\n\nThis feature exists in Emacs, for example, the default behaviour of <Tab> folding in org-mode does exactly this.\n\n**Atom Version:** 1.7.3\n**OS and Version:** OS X 10.10.5\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11785/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11784","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11784/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11784/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11784/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11784","id":155579737,"number":11784,"title":"All files open as empty buffers via gvfs on Linux","user":{"login":"khaeru","id":1634164,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1634164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khaeru","html_url":"https://github.com/khaeru","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khaeru/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khaeru/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khaeru/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khaeru/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khaeru/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khaeru/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khaeru/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khaeru/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khaeru/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-05-18T19:15:00Z","updated_at":"2016-06-10T18:43:09Z","closed_at":"2016-05-18T20:15:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\n\nI am trying to use Atom to work on files on a machine I am connected to via SFTP/SSH.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.

I'm trying to get rid of the 80 character guide, but cannot seem to find a way to disable it. \n\nI thought it used to be in Settings as a checkbox with a value you could adjust for the length, but either my memory is incorrect, or it has been changed. I also checked under the View menu, but there is no toggle for it there, either.\n\n@shiftkey pointed out that on his machine setting `Preferred Line Length` to `0` seems to be doing it, but for me that doesn't actually work as setting a `0` value results in Atom automatically changing the value to `1`, which just overlays the line at the 1 character column.\n\nEven more strange about the previous point is that I don't even have `Soft Wrap At Preferred Line Length` checked, so if anything I would assume that `Preferred Line Length` should not be in effect until this is checked.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Download Atom from Atom.io on a new machine.\n2. Open a file.\n3.

(not switching to any tab)\n\nAnother issue is that it jumps between tabs.\nAs an example: say we have 4 tabs\n| tab1 || tab2 || tab3 || tab4 |\nand I am currently on tab3, pressing alt-tab would open me tab2, pressing again would open tab4 and again will open tab1 and then back to tab3\ncontinuing to press these keys will travel the same way.\n\nI don't know what causes any of two, but it happens randomly, meaning that sometimes it works properly and sometimes it doesn't.\n\nLast but not least, while selecting a file, it opens it in a read mode causing the next file select to take place of the current tab, in other words, won't open in a new tab.\nI know that double clicking will open it in write, but can an option be added to disable opening files in read mode completely ?\n\nI am experiencing this issue for a long time, and I thought its minor problem and it will be fixed at some version, but it didn't and it starts to really bother me and makes Atom really uncomfortable to me.\n\n_Side note_: I am not an expert nor package rich user, I only have the Atom setup and minimap and pigments as installed packages.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11780/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11779","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11779/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11779/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11779/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11779","id":155302955,"number":11779,"title":"Unable to paste text copied with xsel, when it contains over 4000 chars","user":{"login":"marjakm","id":6988823,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6988823?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marjakm","html_url":"https://github.com/marjakm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marjakm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marjakm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marjakm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marjakm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marjakm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marjakm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marjakm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marjakm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marjakm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":153145129,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/crash","name":"crash","color":"e11d21","default":false},{"id":97577987,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/linux","name":"linux","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-05-17T16:25:00Z","updated_at":"2016-05-23T22:38:30Z","closed_at":"2016-05-23T22:38:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\n\nxsel is a command-line tool to access X clipboard and selection buffers in linux.

Less error-prone, because we were trying to access rows that weren't actually rendered, and thus throwing an exception when measuring non-contiguous screen rows.\n2. Tighter, because we can just iterate over each screen row and ask for its soft-wrap descriptor.\n\n/cc: @atom/core
