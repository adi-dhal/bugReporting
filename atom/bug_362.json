of the most common issues I've noticed with Atom packages is they fail to dispose their Disposables. This causes a whole load of problems with callbacks being registered multiple times when updating packages (or disabling and re-enabling them). Updating packages to fix issues often doesn't work because the old, broken callbacks stick around until you restart Atom.\n\nThe package development documentation hasn't really been updated since Disposables were introduced. [Your First Package](https://atom.io/docs/v0.169.0/your-first-package) and the [ascii-art package](https://github.com/atom/ascii-art/blob/master/lib/ascii-art.coffee) show how to register commands, but don't hold on to the Disposable, and don't call `dispose` in the `deactivate` method:\n\n``` coffee\natom.workspaceView.command \"ascii-art:convert\", => @convert()\n```\n\nA few examples of popular packages not behaving properly:\n### emmet\n\nhttps://github.com/emmetio/emmet-atom/blob/60ad28616defddc8fb8746476717cc726b53b15b/lib/emmet.coffee#L117\n### linter\n\nhttps://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter/blob/eff2c313efc240aca8d4bc3f9b7dc811988c8bd4/lib/linter-view.coffee#L94\nhttps://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter/blob/eff2c313efc240aca8d4bc3f9b7dc811988c8bd4/lib/linter-view.coffee#L116\n### color-picker\n\nhttps://github.com/thomaslindstrom/color-picker/blob/e9b64487f827223ca9ec0479f7075db48b43f02d/lib/ColorPicker.coffee#L18\n### atomatigit\n\nhttps://github.com/diiq/atomatigit/blob/d521a615517e4e0643987cc4e02fd3a307205be0/lib/atomatigit.coffee#L43\n\nSo package developers often have no idea they're missing something. I think this is unfortunately contributing to a negative image - while Atom's core packages are great, users are bound to associate the problems caused by third party packages with Atom itself.\n\nIt needs to be made more explicit that when you register commands or other callbacks, you need to hold on to the Disposable, and you need to dispose it properly when you're done with it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4934/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4933","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4933/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4933/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4933/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4933","id":53813669,"number":4933,"title":"404
