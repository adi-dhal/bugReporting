However, currently in Atom it seems to be a little bit too smart, and taking control away from the coder.\n\nThe problem I have with it is that It doesn't respect where you put your cursor before pasting:\n\n![ex1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tcun18tsprgszw2/cursor%20position%20not%20respected.gif?dl=1)\n\nIn my opinion, the cursor position should be used as a baseline for the pasting operation, _not_ whatever Atom thinks is the baseline based on surrounding code.\n\nIf I want to paste something starting at a certain indentation, I would like Atom to respect that, even if Atom thinks the proper indentation is different. Right now, it's just causing frustration, because I have to paste something and then correct the auto indentation, fighting against the editor, rather than having the editor do the work for me.\n\nSublime does this well (reinstalled it just to record this):\n\n![ex2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uokpiuri56pxgtn/cursor%20position%20respected%20in%20sublime.gif?dl=1)\n\nIs it possible to
