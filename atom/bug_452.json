hacking on Atom for the past week, I was able to simulate custom client-side window decorations (ala GNOME) and was hoping I could propose an official api.\n\nMy proof of concept is here (the hack was quick and dirty): https://github.com/nikolowry/atom-csd. \n\nThe api could possibly detect if a global menu is present (Mac, Unity, Mate, etc), which would then ensure the original menu api functions as expected. However in OS's/DEs that don't use global menu's (Fedora, Ubuntu GNOME, WIndows, etc) it would both detach the menu and serve a frameless window.\n\nAnother idea could be to place some optional settings/flags in the api that would make the end-user ultimately responsible for choosing if they want a frameless window/detached menu or only the frameless window.\n\nI have no qualms with writing a clean/modular/logical solution and issuing a pull request when I'm finished, but would only start with the blessings of the atom team.\n\nBefore writing this request for consideration, I made sure to check if it was possible to intercept window creation at run-time in the atom-shell and was informed it was not: https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/issues/302\n\nI know how difficult it is to optimize cross-platform and to propose custom/experimental designs/solutions in a corporate setting (regardless of whether said organization is horizontally or vertically integrated), and appreciate your consideration either way.\n\nIf we could implement this, Atom would surely become the \"champion editor\" for us developers that prefer to run a non-traditional-OS/DE.\n\nYour support for either a full blown \"offical window theme api\" w default styles (ala the ui/syntax manager) or just a simple api intended exclusively for package developers, would be amazing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2215/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2214","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2214/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2214/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2214/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2214","id":33453714,"number":2214,"title":"When
