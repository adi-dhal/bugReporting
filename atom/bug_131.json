Packages/programs that assume that the absence of a NODE_ENV implies a development environment may not work correctly.\n\nhttps://github.com/gandm/language-babel/issues/199\n\nE.g. My package [language-babel](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/6e6771ad5c913313de2bf83fecb38cdd0d6724b8/src/initialize-application-window.coffee#L20) transpiles code using Babel. Babel assumes the absence of NODE_ENV to mean that process.env.NODE_ENV is 'development', but Atom changes this state to 'production' and hence the transpiles may loose information such as source maps.\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n\nCan the above line be removed. It appears a hangover from when Atom used React and as far as I can see atom itself makes no use of this setting. If that isn't possible, the starting state needs to be recorded somewhere accessible to packages.\n### Versions\n\nAll versions on all platforms.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11912/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11911","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11911/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11911/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11911/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11911","id":158642391,"number":11911,"title":"Saving a file with CTRL+S consistently crashes Atom (Windows 7 Enterprise Service Pack 1)","user":{"login":"habi","id":1651235,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1651235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/habi","html_url":"https://github.com/habi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/habi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/habi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/habi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/habi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/habi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/habi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/habi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/habi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/habi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":153145129,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/crash","name":"crash","color":"e11d21","default":false},{"id":171329633,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-reproduction","name":"needs-reproduction","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":192100748,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/network","name":"network","color":"f7c6c7","default":false},{"id":62363277,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":20,"created_at":"2016-06-06T10:03:35Z","updated_at":"2017-09-06T06:31:17Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\n\nI downloaded a fresh installation of Atom and edited my first (Markdown) file with it.\nSaving the file with CTRL+S consistently crashes Atom.\nNot a very good first interaction with the editor on Windows...\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.

This is necessary for use cases such as powerpc assembly, in which some opcodes behave differently when suffixed with a period, and in some cases only function with a period.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Use a language highlighting package that looks for terms ending in '.', such as [language-powerpc-assembly](https://github.com/ruscur/language-powerpc-assembly)\n2. Activate that language, type a term that should be highlighted (in my case, `addi`), and on a new line, a term that _should_ be highlighted that ends in a '.' (in my case, `stdcx.`)\n\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]\n\nTerms ending in a '.' should be highlighted just as terms that don't end in a '.' are.\n\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\n\nTerms ending in a '.' are not highlighted until numbers are added after, it seems that there is hardcoded checking for numbers after a '.'\n\n![Example](http://imgur.com/gAPDMS7l.png)\n### Versions\n\n```\nAtom    : 1.7.4\nElectron: 0.36.12\nChrome  : 47.0.2526.110\nNode    : 5.1.1\n\napm  1.9.2\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython

solution is located at** https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11905#issuecomment-224336832\n\n**PROBLEM: The functionality for `CMD +` is not accessible by packages and themes.**  Instead, [it is hardcoded to modify `atom-text-editor` element for `font-size` by hardcoding `#px` pixel value](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/6f1c1fd0e0242b096f4781698066788b26af2fa4/src/workspace-element.coffee#L54).\n\nThis does not allow the reuse of this functionality for custom packages and CSS.  The proposed solution noted at https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11905#issuecomment-224336832 is to move the variable it is modifying to a global mixin, for reuse at this same `atom-text-editor` element and `font-size` attribute.\n\nAn example use-case: When resizing the font size with CMD-+ (or CMD-SHIFT-+), only the Editor window is resized - not the TreeView, Tabs, StatusBar, ScrollBar, Dialogs (Find, Packages, etc), or anything else.  \n\nBEFORE: Atom default font...\n<img width=\"1920\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-06-05 at 11 02 13 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/104980/15806220/13c5f3b8-2b0d-11e6-95a6-8fba971725ca.png\">\n\nAFTER: pressing CMD-+ several times to greatly increase font size...\n<img width=\"1920\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-06-05 at 11 03 34 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/104980/15806224/33e268d4-2b0d-11e6-84b1-69bbc841dfab.png\">\n\n^- Only the Editor is resized, making the Treeview and Debugger and other dialogs extremely hard to read in screencasts/meetup presentations.\n\nThis is really needed, especially for doing Meetups Presentations, Screencasts and even Screen sharing/Code pairing sessions.  Just make a few CMD-+ to blow everything up to enormous size and everyone is happy. \n\nThis was originally mentioned back in November 2015.\n\n> Does anyone know how could I make @font-size change along with zoom levels? E.g. ctrl+/-/scroll-up/down. Thanks!\n> https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2530#issuecomment-153580043\n\nIf we compare to VSCode, VSCode resizes everything with CMD-+ (Editor window, TreeView, Tabs, StatusBar, Scrollbar, dialogs, and everything else).  For example, here's VSCode before and after:\n\nBEFORE: VSCode default font size...\n<img width=\"1920\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-06-05 at 10 44 53 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/104980/15806121/9959af4a-2b0a-11e6-97ef-02f8f6fa23ac.png\">\n\nAFTER: pressing CMD-+ a few times blows everything up large.\n<img width=\"1920\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-06-05 at 10 40 08 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/104980/15806097/f23fe8be-2b09-11e6-9dac-bdd30a9cca78.png\">\n\n^- that's a fullscreen shot at 3840x2400!\n\nIn summary, the root issue is that `CMD +` is modifying the base stylesheet directly.  We cannot access this functionality with custom packages and custom CSS.  If a mixin was used instead, simple CSS overrides for the user could reuse them, as noted above.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open a code file\n2. Press CMD-+ a few times\n\n**Expected behavior:** When pressing CMD-+, I expect a global mixin or some other variable to access for custom packages and custom CSS.\n\n**Actual behavior:** There is no global mixin - it is hardcoded to change the base stylesheet.\n### Versions\n\n```\n$ atom --version\nAtom    : 1.8.0\nElectron: 0.36.8\nChrome  : 47.0.2526.110\nNode    : 5.1.1\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11905/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11904","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11904/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11904/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11904/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11904","id":158556032,"number":11904,"title":"Key-to-character mapping gets stuck in AltGr-Mode","user":{"login":"jdittrich","id":3416487,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3416487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdittrich","html_url":"https://github.com/jdittrich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdittrich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdittrich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdittrich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdittrich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdittrich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdittrich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdittrich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdittrich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdittrich/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":171329633,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-reproduction","name":"needs-reproduction","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2016-06-05T14:07:31Z","updated_at":"2017-03-29T09:49:40Z","closed_at":"2016-08-10T14:38:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\n\nAfter using AltGr characters, Atom gets stuck in AltGr-mode and  produces only AltGr characters of the pressed keys, e.g. if I press \"E\" I get \"â‚¬\"\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.

1.11.1, which includes atom/apm#562 and atom/apm#563. Since npm 3 flattens packages by default, the build had to change relatively significantly, and I'm sure there are more edge cases to track down. This also bumps Atom's own npm to 3.9.5.\n\nOf particular note, I removed the `apm clean` command that runs as part of the build. It didn't seem to be working in the first place, and seems to have trouble with npm 3's package flattening; maybe we can delegate to `npm prune` here. Since published builds get built from scratch, I think this is probably not a huge deal.\n\n@atom/core, @atom/feedback, @damieng, I would love for you to pull down this branch and try to build Atom and make sure it runs correctly and that package-related operations work. It's _extremely likely_ you will have to run `script/clean` first; sorry, things are just too different.\n\nFixes #5109\nMakes #7822 (more) possible\nProbably a bunch of others too\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11897/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":5,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11896","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11896/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11896/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11896/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11896","id":158479716,"number":11896,"title":"Findable Settings","user":{"login":"KiYugadgeter","id":7894040,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7894040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KiYugadgeter","html_url":"https://github.com/KiYugadgeter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KiYugadgeter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KiYugadgeter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KiYugadgeter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KiYugadgeter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KiYugadgeter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KiYugadgeter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KiYugadgeter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KiYugadgeter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KiYugadgeter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true},{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-06-04T01:10:31Z","updated_at":"2016-06-04T01:12:14Z","closed_at":"2016-06-04T01:12:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Settings is not Findable\n\n[Can not find string on Settings]\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.

I'll list a couple examples, but it's probably worth going through the examples in the document on Windows.\n\nFor example, `ALT` + `Right` moves to the end of the word and that works great! But `CMD` + `Right` is supposed to move to the end of the line. In mapping that to Windows I assumed that would be `CTRL` + `Right` but that doesn't work. Neither does `CTRL` + `e`. I also tried `CTRL` + `ALT` + `Right` just in case but that just changed the orientation of my screen to sideways which really sucks. :stuck_out_tongue: \n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open a text document in Atom on Windows\n2. Move the cursor to the middle of a line.\n3. Hit the key combo `CTRL` + `Right`\n\n**Expected behavior:** Cursor moves to the end of the line.\n\n**Actual behavior:** Cursor moves to the end of the word.\n### Versions\n\nYou can get this information from executing `atom --version` and `apm --version` at the command line. Also, please include the OS and what version of the OS you're running.\n- Atom Version 1.7.4\n- Windows 10\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11894","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11894/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11894/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11894/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11894","id":158424412,"number":11894,"title":"Editor not responding when working with large files.","user":{"login":"sssw01","id":16027895,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16027895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sssw01","html_url":"https://github.com/sssw01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sssw01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sssw01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sssw01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sssw01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sssw01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sssw01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sssw01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sssw01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sssw01/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2016-06-03T18:17:18Z","updated_at":"2017-03-05T18:14:10Z","closed_at":"2016-06-29T00:46:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I've been using atom for 5 months.

Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nAtom's comment command (Ctrl-/ by default) uses CSS comment syntax when used on an HTML style block instead of the HTML comment syntax. See the gif below:\n\n![hjan6lansi](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2991842/15781496/5e61d652-2974-11e6-846e-a02f838dd60a.gif)\n\nThis bug occurs as long as there is at least one character (including whitespace characters) between the tags. If the block is completely empty, this issue does not occur.\n\nCommenting out individual CSS rules within the style block works correctly (using the CSS syntax).\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open a new or existing document with HTML syntax highlighting\n2. Find or write an HTML style block that does not just immediately close (just a space or even a newline between the tags is sufficient to reproduce this issue)\n3. Select the entire style block (from opening to closing tags)\n4. Press Ctrl-/ (Editor: Toggle Line Comments)\n\n**Expected behavior:** HTML comment syntax is used to comment out the style tag\n\n**Actual behavior:** CSS comment syntax is used to (incorrectly) comment out the style tag\n### Versions\n\nAtom 1.7.4\napm 1.9.2\nWindows 7 Pro SP1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11892/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11891","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11891/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11891/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11891/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11891","id":158367864,"number":11891,"title":"French Keyboard Layout can't wrote } or ].","user":{"login":"moanatari","id":10980077,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10980077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moanatari","html_url":"https://github.com/moanatari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moanatari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moanatari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moanatari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moanatari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moanatari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moanatari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moanatari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moanatari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moanatari/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true},{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-06-03T13:31:35Z","updated_at":"2016-06-03T16:12:06Z","closed_at":"2016-06-03T16:11:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\n\nIt is impossible to write the symbols \"}\" and \"]\" with a French keyboard.\nIm sad. :cry: \n\nFrench Keyboard Layout : http://f.tqn.com/y/french/1/S/m/H/2/frenchkeyboard.jpg\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.

Description\n\nWhen launching atom under Ubuntu Xfce desktop environment, atom window never shows up, and no errors are displayed.

After running the atom command it displays the app load time and then just sits there and the window never comes up.\n\nI am using ubuntu server with the Xfce desktop manager over an x2go connection.\n\nI have also tested it over tightvnc and with KDE4 (with both x2go and tightvnc) with the exact same results.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.
