This makes it feel jerky and also makes it especially hard to control at small editor sizes.\n\nThis PR uses a different code path to autoscroll when selecting with the mouse, providing a smoother and more controlled experience. The scroll speed is a quadratic function of the mouse cursor's distance beyond the edge of the editor viewport, and I'm open to adjusting the parameters if anyone wants to experiment or pull something from another codebase.\n\n![comfy-scroll](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1789/9536808/b0485090-4ced-11e5-8d2b-dc720f1d2919.gif)\n- [x] Experiment with a mouse-specific autoscroll code path\n- [x] Test coverage for new code\n- [x] Fix existing broken tests\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8547","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8547/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8547/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8547/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8547","id":103624249,"number":8547,"title":"Clean up max scroll margin code","user":{"login":"nathansobo","id":1789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo","html_url":"https://github.com/nathansobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-08-28T00:57:46Z","updated_at":"2015-08-28T00:58:11Z","closed_at":"2015-08-28T00:58:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/8547","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8547","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8547.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8547.patch"},"body":"Previously we were attempting the same computation twice, once incorrectly when returning the scroll margins as integers and then doing the same thing in terms of pixels.

We do so for `.line-number`s as well, so that we don't have to deal with DOM ordering while still solving the problem.\n\nAmong all the solutions proposed in the above issue, I feel like this is the most unobtrusive (assuming we don't want to change the visuals). Although this doesn't solve an analogous scenario (i.e. when a decoration overlaps the previous row), it fixes the pretty common issue we are observing on the gutter.\n\nI'll test drive this to check if anything got screwed up.
