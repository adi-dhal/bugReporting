Still, we can do better in helping users give us feedback so that [we don't get overloaded](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/1621). It will be easier on us, and a better experience for them. \n\nThe majority of tickets we received from Atom's in-app Feedback form were bug reports and feature requests for specific packages. We created a few canned responses to handle those types of questions, but that mostly creates unnecessary load on us and an interaction delay for users.\n\nAs @bnferguson said, the [Feedback form](https://github.com/atom/feedback) is the key piece of solving this -- it should instruct users where to submit which type of feedback.\n\n![](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/671378/2241417/636173a2-9cd0-11e3-8e3e-f16f98820c40.png)\n\nHere's a few ideas for things we might include in the feedback form:\n- Tell users that most parts of Atom are packages which are open source repositories (a lot of users don't know this). We give a few example (e.g. tree view, tabs, command palette), and link those examples to their repositories. Also, we give links to the [atom.io package list](https://atom.io/packages) where it's possible to search packages and the in-app package list where they can click on the \"Report issue\" button.\n- Tell users that they can submit bug reports and feature requests for packages by creating issues on the associated repositories.\n- Tell users that they can submit ideas for new packages and general feedback on [the forums](http://discuss.atom.io/) (Why will we charge for atom? Where's the windows version? Anyone making a package for real-time collaboration?)\n- Link to [the FAQ](https://atom.io/faq) (\"Make sure you check out the FAQ\")\n- Link to [the contributing docs](https://atom.io/docs/v0.64.0/contributing) so that they know how to submit feedback (\"Check out our contributing guide for tips on providing feedback and making pull requests\")\n\nFrom experience, users reacted really well to our responses so far, which were based on the guidelines above. We have awesome users :heart:, let's provide an even more amazing support experience!\n\nI'd also love to hear everyone's thoughts about the forums (I'm not active there yet). Are people getting along there? What's working okay, and what's not? Anything we can do to make the experience better?\n\ncc @probablycorey @nathansobo @kevinsawicki @thedaniel @cameronmcefee @bnferguson @jonmagic @gjtorikian @sundaykofax @mojombo\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1664/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1663","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1663/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1663/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1663/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/1663","id":28638464,"number":1663,"title":"People reporting Atom hanging after > 8 new untitled buffers are opened","user":{"login":"nathansobo","id":1789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo","html_url":"https://github.com/nathansobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":52925411,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/performance","name":"performance","color":"d4c5f9","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2014-03-03T17:18:17Z","updated_at":"2014-08-05T18:15:43Z","closed_at":"2014-08-05T17:53:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"http://discuss.atom.io/t/why-can-i-only-have-one-new-file-at-a-time/447/12?u=nathansobo\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1663/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1662","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1662/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1662/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1662/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/1662","id":28617604,"number":1662,"title":"Update available message is worded oddly","user":{"login":"cobyism","id":296432,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/296432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobyism","html_url":"https://github.com/cobyism","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobyism/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobyism/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobyism/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobyism/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobyism/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobyism/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobyism/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobyism/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobyism/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-03-03T12:13:24Z","updated_at":"2014-03-03T16:31:56Z","closed_at":"2014-03-03T16:29:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Just noticed this:\n\n![2014-03-03 at 12 10 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/296432/2309173/0498d146-a2cd-11e3-82c2-5c89dab7f711.png)\n\nAn update \"is being downloading\" isn’t correct.
