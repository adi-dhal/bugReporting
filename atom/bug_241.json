It comes with software that enables smooth scrolling (the wheel spins freely so it doesn't feel great to have things still scroll in chunks). Now, when atom is inactive, and the mouse is hovered over top of the editor, this behaves as expected: the editor scrolls smoothly, without a set increment. However, once the editor is made active (clicked inside) it will only scroll in distinct chunks. \n\nHopefully someone finds a simple fix, however it is not critical,\n\nNico \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8581","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8581/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8581/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8581/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8581","id":103940589,"number":8581,"title":"Race condition when opening files leads to data loss","user":{"login":"ChrisJefferson","id":811527,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/811527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisJefferson","html_url":"https://github.com/ChrisJefferson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisJefferson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisJefferson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisJefferson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisJefferson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisJefferson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisJefferson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisJefferson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisJefferson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisJefferson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":372218233,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/data-loss","name":"data-loss","color":"e11d21","default":false},{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2015-08-30T19:08:38Z","updated_at":"2016-10-11T00:58:03Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I have had this problem happen in other circumstances (disconnected windows into the same file), but I seem to be able to reproduce it reliably this way.\n\nOpen a terminal, type `atom file.txt & ; atom file.txt` (make sure file.txt does not current exist)\n\nTwo windows into file.txt will open.
