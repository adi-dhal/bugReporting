I've configured git to use Atom as its core editor. Mostly Atom works for me; and mostly, git works for me. Together, they aren't happy.\n\nAtom is configured as the editor in this manner: git config --global core.editor \"'C:/users/[user]/appdata/local/atom/bin/atom.cmd' --new-window --wait\"\n\nI've also tried it without the \"--new-window\" flag, with no difference in result.\n\nWhen I issue a \"git commit\" command, I get some form of the following, IF THERE'S NO CURRENT\nINSTANCE OF ATOM:\n\n```\nApp load time: 545ms\n[1228:0424/183520:WARNING:accelerator_util.cc(118)] Invalid accelerator token: command\n[1228:0424/183520:WARNING:accelerator_util.cc(118)] Invalid accelerator token: command\n[1228:0424/183520:WARNING:accelerator_util.cc(118)] Invalid accelerator token: command\n[1228:0424/183520:WARNING:accelerator_util.cc(118)] Invalid accelerator token: command\n[1228:0424/183522:INFO:CONSOLE(52)] \"Window load time: 1483ms\", source: file:///C:/Users/[user]/AppData/Local/atom/app-1.7.2/resources/app.asar/static/index.js (52)\n[1228:0424/183525:INFO:CONSOLE(1282)] \"Error refreshing repository status:\", source: C:\\Users[user]\\AppData\\Local\\atom\\app-1.7.2\\resources\\app.asar\\src\\git-repository-async.js (1282)\n[1228:0424/183525:INFO:CONSOLE(1283)] \"Error: Reference 'refs/heads/master' not found\", source: C:\\Users[user]\\AppData\\Local\\atom\\app-1.7.2\\resources\\app.asar\\src\\git-repository-async.js (1283)\n[1228:0424/183525:INFO:CONSOLE(392)] \"Uncaught (in promise) Error: Reference 'refs/heads/master' not found\", source: node.js (392)\n[1228:0424/183526:INFO:CONSOLE(0)] \"::shadow pseudo-element is deprecated.

Configure Atom as the default editor for git, in gitbash, with this line of code:\n\n```\ngit config --global core.editor \"'C:/users/[user]/appdata/local/atom/bin/atom.cmd' --new-window --wait\"\n```\n1. Commit a change to a repository\n\n**Expected behavior:** \nI expect an Atom window to open with git commit details, and a place for me to enter a commit message. Upon closing this Atom window, I expect the commit to be executed and succeed.\n\n**Actual behavior:** \nThe Atom window does open, and I edit my message and close the window. But instead of executing the commit, the commit fails.\n### Versions\n\n**From apm --version:**\napm  1.9.2\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 3.5.1\ngit 2.8.1.windows.1\nvisual studio\n\n**From

Prerequisites\n- [ ] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode)?\n- [ ] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [ ] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [ ] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [ ] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [yes] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nI am building a javascript file ( development file ) which has both minified ( Google closure compiler ) and un-minified code.\nWhen I save the file, automatically unminifies the minified block.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. [First Step]\n   Take the following code\n\n``` js\nfunction str_replace(h,d,b,f){var a=0,c=0,g=\"\",l=\"\",m=0,n=0,k=[].concat(h),e=[].concat(d),p=\"[object Array]\"===Object.prototype.toString.call(e),q=\"[object Array]\"===Object.prototype.toString.call(b);b=[].concat(b);if(\"object\"===typeof h&&\"string\"===typeof d){g=d;d=[];for(a=0;a<h.length;a+=1)d[a]=g;e=[].concat(d);p=\"[object Array]\"===Object.prototype.toString.call(e)}f&&(this.window[f]=0);a=0;for(m=b.length;a<m;a++)if(\"\"!==b[a])for(c=0,n=k.length;c<n;c++)g=b[a]+\"\",l=p?void 0!==e[c]?e[c]:\"\":e[0],b[a]=\ng.split(k[c]).join(l),f&&(this.window[f]+=g.split(k[c]).length-1);return q?b:b[0]};\n\nfunction _aux_identLocal(id) {\n    for (i = 0; i < LOCAIS.length; i++) {\n        if (LOCAIS[i].id == id) {\n            return LOCAIS[i].nome;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n1. [Second Step]\n   Save the file\n\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]\nI would expect the code to be:\n\n``` js\nfunction str_replace(h,d,b,f){var a=0,c=0,g=\"\",l=\"\",m=0,n=0,k=[].concat(h),e=[].concat(d),p=\"[object Array]\"===Object.prototype.toString.call(e),q=\"[object Array]\"===Object.prototype.toString.call(b);b=[].concat(b);if(\"object\"===typeof h&&\"string\"===typeof d){g=d;d=[];for(a=0;a<h.length;a+=1)d[a]=g;e=[].concat(d);p=\"[object Array]\"===Object.prototype.toString.call(e)}f&&(this.window[f]=0);a=0;for(m=b.length;a<m;a++)if(\"\"!==b[a])for(c=0,n=k.length;c<n;c++)g=b[a]+\"\",l=p?void 0!==e[c]?e[c]:\"\":e[0],b[a]=\ng.split(k[c]).join(l),f&&(this.window[f]+=g.split(k[c]).length-1);return q?b:b[0]};\n\nfunction _aux_identLocal(id) {\n    for (i = 0; i < LOCAIS.length; i++) {\n        if (LOCAIS[i].id == id) {\n            return LOCAIS[i].nome;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\n\n``` js\nfunction str_replace(h, d, b, f) {\n    var a = 0,\n        c = 0,\n        g = \"\",\n        l = \"\",\n        m = 0,\n        n = 0,\n        k = [].concat(h),\n        e = [].concat(d),\n        p = \"[object Array]\" === Object.prototype.toString.call(e),\n        q = \"[object Array]\" === Object.prototype.toString.call(b);\n    b = [].concat(b);\n    if (\"object\" === typeof h && \"string\" === typeof d) {\n        g = d;\n        d = [];\n        for (a = 0; a < h.length; a += 1) d[a] = g;\n        e = [].concat(d);\n        p = \"[object Array]\" === Object.prototype.toString.call(e)\n    }\n    f && (this.window[f] = 0);\n    a = 0;\n    for (m = b.length; a < m; a++)\n        if (\"\" !== b[a])\n            for (c = 0, n = k.length; c < n; c++) g = b[a] + \"\", l = p ? void 0 !== e[c] ? e[c] : \"\" : e[0], b[a] =\n                g.split(k[c]).join(l), f && (this.window[f] += g.split(k[c]).length - 1);\n    return q ? b : b[0]\n};\n\nfunction _aux_identLocal(id) {\n    for (i = 0; i < LOCAIS.length; i++) {\n        if (LOCAIS[i].id == id) {\n            return LOCAIS[i].nome;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n### Versions\n\nAtom version: 1.6.2\nOSX Version: 10.11.4

there's a little bit less allocated after that, but more often than not - more. after a few moments of alt-tabbing, 150mb turns into 300mb, after a while - into over 1gb of ram, used for nothing.\n\nheap profiling shows constant 42mb. safe mode - same thing. looks like a bug.\n\nlatest stable version, everything checked. and i'm just updating this issue, because i've found one little important detail - the problem occurs when one (of two in my case) folders added to the tree view is .atom - it doesn't matter if the tree view is hidden. after removing .atom from the tree view, memory leak doesn't happen. there's a small cpu spike but nothing that major, and there's no major memory allocation change.

search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nWindows 10 x64, Atom v1.7.2 (installed with the Windows installer)\n\nAtom started to crash VERY frequently for me, almost every hour, when I'm regularly typing in the editor. It started to happen recently, either 1.7.2 or 1.7.1 version. I use Atom for at least 5 hours a day so I'm seeing this 4-5 times a day.\n\nI have two different Windows 10 x64 machines and this started to happen simultaneously in both machines. Both have 16GB memory and I never use more than 50% of it. Intel i5-3340M & i7-2600 processors. I tried uninstalling & re-installing several times which didn't fix this issue (cleaned .atom folder too, except for the `config.cson` and `packages` folder).\n\nSee crash logs from `AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Atom Crashes\\operation_log.txt` here: https://gist.github.com/tedyun/2525fbefcdf1f68e82594d419ca37554\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Use Atom v1.7.2 for a while on Windows 10 x64.\n2. Editor crashes almost every hour when I'm regularly typing in the editor.\n\n**Expected behavior:** Should not crash that often.\n\n**Actual behavior:** Crashes frequently.\n### Versions\n\n`atom

It would pull in the `atom-editor` package as a required dependency and then, when building the package, run some command to install the `package-sync` package. AUR packages are usually better off installing packages to one's `/usr` directory than to one's home directory the way that apm does by default. For example, Node packages in the AUR use the `/usr` directory and packages are installed there using the command:\n\n``` bash\nnpm install --user root -g --prefix $pkgdir/usr $_npmname@$pkgver\n```\n\nso it would help me to know where the APM packages that come bundled with Atom are installed to, by default, on Linux platforms. I have tried searching the contents of Atom Linux binary packages for such a location but I can't find one, so I assume there is something I am missing.

If I wait slightly after `cmd-F`, it pastes the correct thing. The same lag does not occur within a single editor; only when copying from the editor and into another buffer, in this case the \"find\" field.\n\nHere's a video ([mp4](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9iut1241xq5gl8f/atom.mp4?dl=0)). It's slowed down to 1/10 of the real speed and shows me copying the word \"key\" and pasting it, which ends up being \"position\", which wasn't what I copied. (Please ignore the fact when the \"find\" panel is shown intially, it contains the word \"key\". That's from a previous attempt. Had to do this a bunch of times to reproduce in a way that was understandable in a video.)\n\n![atom](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/50314/14751466/ffb107ba-0897-11e6-9025-a093af078c79.gif)\n\nIt's super annoying because I work very fast, and this has started hitting me constantly.
