The label contains an ampersand to define access keys on the supported platforms (Windows & Linux). But because the label begins with an ampersand, on Darwin the Tool Bar menu item is sorted as first item. Aldo this is great advertisement, some people have [reported it](https://github.com/suda/tool-bar/issues/97) (and I agree).\n\nAfter some digging I found the following: the package menu is sorted [here](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/7d743827820969871e8724e6f353887a3ddfc105/src/menu-manager.coffee#L67) by [function here](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/7d743827820969871e8724e6f353887a3ddfc105/src/menu-manager.coffee#L203) which [normalizes every menuitem](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/8427196d87e06c5cda2ba9568f518539b27bb1e1/src/menu-helpers.coffee#L40), except for [Darwin](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/8427196d87e06c5cda2ba9568f518539b27bb1e1/src/menu-helpers.coffee#L43).\n\nApparently the ampersand is still stripped out when visible on screen, but not for sorting. This looks like a (minor) bug to me.\n\nI haven't found a way to define separate menu configs per platform (like Atom does with it's [own menu's](https://github.com/atom/atom/tree/master/menus)), but please correct me if I've missed something.\n\n---\n\n_Atom 1.4.0 & 1.5.0-beta0_\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10583/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10582","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10582/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10582/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10582/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10582","id":128640158,"number":10582,"title":".gitignore not reflecting live","user":{"login":"asotog","id":813023,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/813023?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asotog","html_url":"https://github.com/asotog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asotog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asotog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asotog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asotog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asotog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asotog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asotog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asotog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asotog/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":97577987,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/linux","name":"linux","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false},{"id":62363277,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":17,"created_at":"2016-01-25T21:16:24Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T20:10:10Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T20:10:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\n\nSteps to reproduce\n1 -

Normally you'd use `gksu/kdesu` or the newer [polkit](http://www.freedesktop.org/software/polkit/docs/latest/pkexec.1.html)/policykit with `pkexec`. The former does nothing, I setup a policy file for polkit and everything seemed good, Atom opened like a fresh install with no packages or past working tabs open. However I was unable to save a file getting a `permission denied` error. This worked fine with Gedit using polkit I could run `pkexec gedit` and save a file in the same location as root, with `pkexec atom` no file was saved as myself or root, just running `atom` would allow me to write a file as myself.\n\nI believe this might have something to do with how Atom launches via a shell script instead of a binary directly?

The Samba share is on Windows 7 SP1.\n\nI didn't see this behavior in 1.3.x.\n\nRepro:\n1.  Edit a plain text file on a Samba share.\n2.  (Atom creates a `.tmp` file in the same directory.  Sometimes.  Not always.  I don't know the repro steps to force it to do so.  \"Back Up Before Saving\" is off, so this must be some kind of special temp file.)\n3.  Close the tab for the plain text file.  Temp file isn't deleted.\n4.  Close Atom.\n\nExpected:\n\nAtom deletes the temp file.\n\nActual:\n\nAtom doesn't delete the temp file.  The file can't be deleted either via Finder in OS X or via Windows Explorer on the Windows box where the Samba share resides.\n\nFinder gives the error \"The operation can’t be completed because an unexpected error occurred (error code -8072).\"\n\nWindows Explorer says that the deletion can't complete without administrative rights and shows the elevation dialog.  Elevating doesn't help: another dialog is displayed saying that the file can't be deleted.  (I didn't capture the exact error text of the dialog.)  Attempting to take ownership of the file via `takeown` and modifying its ACLs via `icacls` fail:\n\n```\n> takeown /s MYBOXNAME /u MYBOXNAME\\MyUsername /f . /r\n\nWARNING: User credentials cannot be used for local connections.\nERROR: The current logged on user does not have ownership privileges on\n       the file (or folder) \"E:\\work\\current\".\n\n> icacls . /grant MYBOXNAME\\MyUsername:f /t\nprocessed file: .\nprocessed file: .\\notes.txt\n.\\notes.txt~RF449e304.TMP: Access is denied.\nSuccessfully processed 2 files; Failed processing 1 files\n\n>\n```\n\n`handles.exe` v3.46 (a Sysinternals tool by Mark Russinovich) shows that System has open handles on the temp file.\n\nThe temp file only gets deleted when the Samba share is unmounted from OS X.\n\nMultiple temp files may be created, so reference above to \"the temp file\" are also applicable to \"the temp files\".  Again, I'm not sure under what circumstances Atom creates them, but the end result is that heavy Atom work on a Samba share leaves un-deletable temp files scattered about which screw up directory diffs, syncing directories, moving things around, uploading directories to other places, deleting directories that are no longer needed, recursively adding directories to source control, etc. etc. etc., and force an unmount and remount to resolve.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10558/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10557","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10557/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10557/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10557/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10557","id":128367002,"number":10557,"title":"editor:*-to-next-word-boundary commands can't cross CRLF line boundary on OS X","user":{"login":"WalterGR","id":380880,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/380880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalterGR","html_url":"https://github.com/WalterGR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalterGR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalterGR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalterGR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalterGR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalterGR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalterGR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalterGR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalterGR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalterGR/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-01-24T02:05:25Z","updated_at":"2017-03-27T08:49:48Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Atom 1.4.0 on OS X 10.10.5.\n\n`editor:move-to-next-word-boundary` and `editor:delete-to-next-word-boundary` will not move/delete across a CRLF line boundary on OS X.
