It seems to have a set width and if the filename or path is longer than the width of the text field then the overflowing text is hidden.\n\nUsually in these sort of text fields the text will scroll to follow the cursor so that you can still read the text that would normally overflow.\n\nI like to use the New Folder and New File features, but if it's too deep in the project directories it gets really frustrating that I can't use it.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/nFOqz8X.gif\n## Repro Steps\n1. Right-click a file in the file tree and select \"Rename\"\n2. The filename dialog appears.\n3. In a file with a path longer than the width of the text field, attempt to view any text that is overflowing out of the field.\n\n**Expected:** I expect the text field to scroll with the overflowing text.\n**Actual:** The text field does not scroll/resize at all.

Of course s/he can also enable it back again\n2. when Atom is updated, again user will not have to re-edit the registry (nor settings) because Atom will \"remember\" that items were disabled and keep them like that.\n### Implementation\n1. Windows Registry operations needed to be invoked by more than one place, so they have been extracted from `squirrel-update.coffee` and moved to a new `WinRegistry` module in `win-registry.coffee`.\n2. Because registry operations need ChildProcess.spawn functionalities, those have been extract from  `squirrel-update.coffee` as well and moved to a new `Spawner` in `spawner.coffee`.\n3. A new checkbox <-> boolean setting has been added to the core settings pane in `config-schema.coffee`.\n4. The new setting is monitored by a dedicated module, `WinContextMenuSettings` in `win-context-menu-settings.coffee`. When setting changes, that is responsible for updating the registry by invoking `WinRegistry`\n5. `atom.coffee` creates an instance of that monitor, and dispose that when it's time to\n6. `WinContextMenuSettings` monitor got its own specs\n7. Some `squirrel-update-spec.coffee` specs, related to ignoring errors, where actually a test on spawning functionality, so they have been moved to a new `spawner-spec.coffee`\n8. Specs for the shell context menu integration upon update found place in `squirrel-update-spec.coffee`\n9. In `squirrel-update-spec.coffee` then there was a repetition on how to invoke a callback, and that has been factored \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8780/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8779","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8779/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8779/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8779/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8779","id":106257497,"number":8779,"title":"Update to Electron v0.33.x","user":{"login":"zcbenz","id":639601,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/639601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz","html_url":"https://github.com/zcbenz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcbenz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":17,"created_at":"2015-09-14T02:01:12Z","updated_at":"2015-10-17T05:28:05Z","closed_at":"2015-10-16T21:59:14Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/8779","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8779","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8779.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8779.patch"},"body":"Node modules to update:\n- [x] runas\n- [x] pathwatcher\n- [x] nslog\n- [x] oniguruma\n- [x] git-utils\n- [x] spellchecker\n- [x] scrollbar-style\n- [x] keyboard-layout\n- [x] atom-keymap\n- [x] first-mate\n- [x] scandal\n- [x] text-buffer\n- [x] apm\n- [x] highlights\n- [x] ctags\n\nAtom packages to update:\n- [x] bracket-matcher\n- [x] link\n- [x] markdown-preview\n- [x] symbols-view\n- [x] tree-view\n- [x] spell-check\n\nFixes #8508\nFixes #7061\nFixes #3593\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8778","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8778/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8778/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8778/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8778","id":106240342,"number":8778,"title":"Use system menu font for Atom UI","user":{"login":"mnquintana","id":823545,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/823545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana","html_url":"https://github.com/mnquintana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722948,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-review","name":"needs-review","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-09-13T21:19:43Z","updated_at":"2015-09-16T14:16:29Z","closed_at":"2015-09-16T14:08:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/8778","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8778","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8778.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8778.patch"},"body":"Closes https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8656\n\nIf `@font-family` is undefined by a theme, then Atom will use the OS's default menu font in its place.

I click with the mouse over any line in the editor, the cursor moves to several lines below. For example, if I click on line 1, the cursor appears over line 4 (and it gets selected). If I type, I type on line 4. If I click on line 4, line 9 is selected. If I click on line 9, line 19 is selected, and so on. It seems that the higher number the line I click on, the higher number of lines below the cursor moves. You can see from the above example that the ratio is close to 1:2.\n\nI've traced this behavior to the following text in styles.less\n\n```\nhtml {\n  zoom: 2;\n}\n```\n\nwhich I need to compensate the font size, because I have a HiDPI screen. If I remove that line, there is problem. If I select other values for zoom, similar buggy behavior, with different ratios, similar to the zoom value.\n\nSo, my guess is that the code to decide where to place the cursor when the mouse is clicked doesn't have into account that the text may be zoomed...\n\nFor me, this is big problem, because I need to zoom, and in that case clicking (and selecting with the mouse, etc.) doesn't work.\n\nMy box is Debian testing, amd64, and I'm using atom 1.0.11 as downloaded from the Atom site. I'm using it with Gnome, and for scaling Gnome I use:\n\n```\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface scaling-factor 0\n```\n\nThis, along with setting Font Size to 14 in Editor Settings, seems to be enough to scale the menus in Atom (and in general, the text outside the editing area), but doesn't make the fonts in the editing area larger.\n\nCuriously enough, if I don't set zoom, with the other setting equal, I get too small fonts for the editing area, tabs, and the left column (but not the menus, which are ok).
