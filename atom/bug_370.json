all !\n\nI'm on windows : installed with the new installer on the website after doing a clean remove from chocolatey.\n\nI have a weird problem : if i open atom from the commandline, with atom . or atom ./myfile , then everything work fine. If i open it from the desktop shortcut (or even right click open with atom) then, i can't write anything or create new files, and i've got a bunch of \"module did not register\" in the console from a load of module (all of them i guess ?)\n\nIt's a pretty weird bug, everything worked fine with my old chocolatey version.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4674/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4673","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4673/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4673/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4673/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4673","id":52296115,"number":4673,"title":"generated sample app html question","user":{"login":"mark-hahn","id":811455,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/811455?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn","html_url":"https://github.com/mark-hahn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":17,"created_at":"2014-12-17T21:46:58Z","updated_at":"2015-05-06T01:15:20Z","closed_at":"2015-04-13T20:56:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The generated sample app now generates the html programmatically.

Emitting these events is expensive because:\n- The act of adding scoped settings clears the scoped settings cache\n- Callbacks registered via `atom.config::onDidChange` or `::observe` receive the new property value as an argument. Computing the new value requires re-merging the scoped properties with an _empty cache_.\n\nMerging scoped properties recently became more expensive due to deep-merging.\n#### Solution\n\nThis adds a new method to `Config` called `::transact` which allow multiple config changes to be 'rolled up', firing only one change event.\n\nCurrently, I only use `::transact` in `PackageManager` when activating and deactivating packages. I think the snippets package should also use it when loading snippets files from packages.\n\n/cc @benogle
