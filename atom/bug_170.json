I exit Atom and window state is restored, its size is remembered; so when I start Atom again, the window starts restored and remembers its size. However, when I exit Atom maximized, the restored window size is set to maximized size; so when I start Atom again, it start maximized and when I click restore, the window size remains just the same (maximized size).\n\nSimply said, nonmaximized window is too often set to maximized size and is just too big to normaly drag around and I have to manually resize window to smaller size each time.\n\n**Reproduction Steps:**\n1. Exit Atom maximized\n2. Start Atom again and click \"restore window\"\n3. The window size is same as maximized\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n\nRestored window size should be remembered correctly, so you can actually restore window to its last size, not restore it to maximized size.\n\n**Observed behavior:**\n\nI am unable to test this on different OS than Windows 10. I think it's not Electron bug, since VS Code behaves correctly. The reason why this bothers me is that I can't just grab maximized window and drag it, because it's size is same as maximized (= just too big for dragging around screen).\n\n**Screenshots and GIFs**\n\n![output_qijguj](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6060970/12868449/857bc078-cd07-11e5-9b7b-768d7669e253.gif)\n\n**Atom version:** 1.4.3\n**OS and version:** Windows 10\n\n**Installed packages:**\n\nminimap\n\n**Additional information:**\n- Problem can be reproduced in safe mode: Yes\n- Problem started happening recently, didn't happen in an older version of Atom: No\n- Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: Yes\n- Problem happens with all files and projects, not only some files or projects: Yes\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10720/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10719","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10719/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10719/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10719/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10719","id":131856559,"number":10719,"title":"ATOM_DEV_RESOURCE_PATH needs to be set to run specs","user":{"login":"PaulAik","id":99102,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/99102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAik","html_url":"https://github.com/PaulAik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":163641905,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/atom","name":"atom","color":"f7c6c7","default":false},{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":20,"created_at":"2016-02-06T13:45:47Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T19:10:00Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T19:10:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Having some trouble running the test specs on OSX on version 1.6.0-dev-17bf2b4 (latest from master).\n\nThe command `atom --test spec` produces:\n\n```\nDownloading Update: Could not get code signature for running application\n[26691:0206/133702:INFO:CONSOLE(85)] \"Error: Failed to execute 'registerElement' on 'Document': Registration failed for type 'atom-styles'.

Now to be clear by \"file windows\" I mean the windows (under the tab handles) wherein the contents of the file being edited is shown and can be edited, if my terminology is incorrect please correct me so that in future I can use the correct terminology when reporting Atom issues. In case my explanation is unclear I have taken screenshots of these bugs. These bugs seem to be plugin-independent as running Atom in safe mode makes no difference to these bugs. \n\nIn this first example, you can see the second tab is partially obstructed in its view from the glitch.\n\n![](http://imgur.com/a9IO6Sn.png)\n\nIn this second example, you can see parts of the file window and the left and centre tabs obstructed in their view:\n\n![](http://imgur.com/a31M6oZ.png)\n\nI know that some things seem to trigger its appearance, like scrolling down on larger files, switching between presently-opened windows, _etc._ If you want to know how I installed Atom well I installed it from my own PKGBUILD (which builds the Atom package from source code not from a Debian or RPM binary) which you can find [here](https://github.com/fusion809/PKGBUILDs/blob/master/atom-editor/PKGBUILD). I have observed this bug under two different desktop environments: Cinnamon and KDE Plasma 5 and with several different GTK themes. \n\nOh and yes these bugs seem to be limited to just Atom. All other programs seem to be devoid of this bug. \n\nThanks for your time,\nBrenton\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10714/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10713","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10713/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10713/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10713/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10713","id":131802006,"number":10713,"title":"Please add API to disable IME","user":{"login":"hh9527","id":3439410,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3439410?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hh9527","html_url":"https://github.com/hh9527","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hh9527/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hh9527/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hh9527/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hh9527/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hh9527/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hh9527/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hh9527/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hh9527/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hh9527/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-02-06T01:13:08Z","updated_at":"2016-02-06T17:28:12Z","closed_at":"2016-02-06T17:26:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I am a Chinese vim user.

Use `atom` command to open another file/directory\n\nExpected results:\n- Atom opens new window, becomes focus(maybe?)\n\nActual results:\n- Nothing happens until Atom has been given focus\n\nDeets:\nAtom 1.4.1\nMac OS X 10.11.2\n/usr/local/bin/atom (no version but md5 is 00048d82f98c087e579f24ed32f8c7b2)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10708","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10708/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10708/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10708/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10708","id":131756894,"number":10708,"title":"Flow implies Babel","user":{"login":"joshaber","id":13760,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/13760?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber","html_url":"https://github.com/joshaber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-02-05T21:19:16Z","updated_at":"2016-02-05T22:30:08Z","closed_at":"2016-02-05T22:30:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/10708","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10708","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10708.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10708.patch"},"body":"Something’s gotta remove all those sweet, sweet type annotations.\n\n/cc @maxbrunsfeld @as-cii to make sure I didn’t miss anywhere else where we determine Babel-ness.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10708/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10707","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10707/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10707/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10707/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10707","id":131752545,"number":10707,"title":"Changing repo url breaks apm account token","user":{"login":"mark-hahn","id":811455,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/811455?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn","html_url":"https://github.com/mark-hahn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-hahn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-02-05T20:53:40Z","updated_at":"2016-02-05T20:54:53Z","closed_at":"2016-02-05T20:54:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ignore this.
