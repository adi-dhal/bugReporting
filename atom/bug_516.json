:construction: :construction_worker: :  Allow tabs to be resorted/dragged among themselves and across different panes.  There's still quiet a bit of work left to do, but I want to push this up so we can iterate on it and get some feedback.  \n\nI feel like `Tabs` might be the wrong place for this since `Tabs` represents a single instance of a tab panel.  This has to work across multiple tab instances.  Maybe the drag and drop callbacks would fit better in `RootView`?  Should we trigger some custom events (`tab:dragged`, etc.) here?\n- [x] Drag and drop tabs\n- [x] Drag and drop between panes\n- [x] Prevent duplicate files/edit-sessions from occupying the same editor\n- [ ] ~~Make the tab bars drop targets~~ [PUNTING]\n- [x] Remove pane after last tab is dragged from it\n- [x] Be smarter about determining the new active tab if you drag the current pane's active tab to another pane\n- [x] Improve visual feedback\n- [x] Write specs\n\n/cc @nathansobo @kevinsawicki @probablycorey @jonrohan

Markers combine anchors and anchor ranges into a single construct... basically you can think of a marker as being like a selection. It marks a region of the buffer, with a head and an optional tail. In fact, each cursor / selection pair is now just another layer on top of a single marker in the buffer.\n\nMarkers are identified with a label string, which is currently auto-generated whenever you add a marker. In the future, we plan on allowing you to specify your own marker names, and even scoping them (`name.scope`) like you can with jQuery events.\n\nOne cool thing about markers is that if they are invalidated, undoing the operation that invalidated them will restore the marker. This will help with nested snippet tab stops, because if you type in the outer tab stop and then undo your change, the inner tab stops will be restored.\n\nYou can observe a marker at the buffer level or the display buffer level, and your callback will be fired whenever the head or tail positions change. If you observe at the display buffer level (via `EditSesson`), you'll be notified if either their buffer or screen positions change.\n\nThis is just a first step in what I think will become a very important core facility in Atom. I want markers to closely follow the regions of the buffer they mark. For example, if you cut and paste a region with markers, the markers should go with it. If you duplicate a line with markers, you should duplicate the markers. I want this to be the basis of determining what regions of the code are folded, so that you can copy and paste folded lines.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/242","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/242/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/242/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/242/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/242","id":10716401,"number":242,"title":"Newline & whitespace rendering bug","user":{"login":"mtodd","id":182,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtodd","html_url":"https://github.com/mtodd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtodd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtodd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtodd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtodd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtodd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtodd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtodd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtodd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtodd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2013-02-06T23:13:30Z","updated_at":"2016-02-18T13:24:23Z","closed_at":"2013-02-14T20:41:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"So I've noticed this happening intermittently.

Placing a `console.log` on https://github.com/github/atom/blob/dev/src/app/text-mate-grammar.coffee#L26 to print out the grammars, I get this for the markdown grammar.\n\n```\nMarkdown \n[Object]\n0: Object\ninclude: \"#block\"\n__proto__: Object\nlength: 1\n__proto__: Array[0]\n te\n```\n\nThat's the `patterns`, which is only one. this one https://github.com/textmate/markdown.tmbundle/blob/master/Syntaxes/Markdown.tmLanguage#L20 but that's wrong, `Markdown.tmLanguage` has alot more https://github.com/textmate/markdown.tmbundle/blob/master/Syntaxes/Markdown.tmLanguage#L23-L1102\n\nSo it looks like whatever is loading the grammar is not finding them all.
