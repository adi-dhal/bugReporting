There's a lot to do to get to ideal, and this PR doesn't do any of that... All we do is the minimal to instantiate an `AtomApplication` in our main process mocha suite and test the results of calling `openWithOptions` repeatedly.\n\nThe main reason we did this now is because this test was failing on CircleCI and blocking our build modernization effort and we didn't want to fight with the existing ChromeDriver test.\n\nIn the future, I'd like to have a single method on `AtomApplication` called `launch` that takes CLI arguments directly from our main script. We can integration test that method or mock out a method like `openWindow` that takes options to separate unit testing of CLI parsing from window open logic. The point is, the main process code is just JavaScript and we can test it just like we test anything else. If we reduce `main.js` to just calling `launch`, then we only need ChromeDriver coverage of our shell scripts that launch Atom.\n\n/cc @maxbrunsfeld\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12393","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12393/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12393/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12393/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12393","id":170586587,"number":12393,"title":"Remove config option `editor.backUpBeforeSaving`","user":{"login":"as-cii","id":482957,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/482957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii","html_url":"https://github.com/as-cii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":16,"created_at":"2016-08-11T07:37:21Z","updated_at":"2017-01-26T05:04:43Z","closed_at":"2016-08-16T11:30:00Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/12393","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12393","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12393.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12393.patch"},"body":"After #11828, Atom always creates a backup file in the `~/.atom/recovery` directory, trying to restore it automatically via the main process in case there is a hard crash on the renderer process.

(Well one of the red boxes mentioned below say that there is an issue reported already.)\n### Description\n\nWell, I ran AtomSetup.exe expecting to select how I wanted it installed and stuff, but no, everything was automatic. What I wanted was a portable install for my flashdrive to take to school. Instead I got a local install in AppData or whatever.\n\nI decided to just play with it anyways and I started to install some JavaScript add-ons. While they were installing a breaker blew in my house (this may or may not be relevant). I started my computer back up and went to run Atom again with the icon (that happened to just be a plain icon, not the Atom logo, with the Atom label). Nothing happened, not even a process. So I went to start it manually and it worked, except there were some red boxes with errors saying it couldn't do stuff with the files in the \".atom\" data folder.\n\nI uninstalled, deleted the data folders (manually... -.-), and reinstalled. The red boxes were still there. Uninstalled again.\n\nThen I Googled to see if there was even a portable version of Atom available. Apparently there is according to an issue and a PR here. I downloaded `atom-windows.zip` and extracted. When I ran the `atom.exe`, there the red boxes were once again. Everything also seemed to be in the same state as it was when I closed the last installation.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n(explained in description)\n\n**Expected behavior:** I want a portable version of Atom on my flashdrive that doesn't have any connections to Windows (besides the usual requirements) and runs fine.\n\n**Actual behavior:** Explained above.\n### Versions\n\nLatest stable, 1.9.8.\nWindows 10 Pro 64 bit.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9919010/17577791/dbc8e304-5f4f-11e6-95f6-1eb7a0c4d05f.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12391","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12391/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12391/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12391/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12391","id":170527894,"number":12391,"title":"Atom

Run `apm test` and observe the failures\n\n**Expected behavior:** Tests pass - ignored paths are correctly ignored when the `paths` option is set.\n\n**Actual behavior:** Tests fail - ignored paths are not ignored when the `paths` option is set.\n### Versions\n\nAtom    : 1.9.4\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\nOS : Ubuntu 16.04\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12389/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12388","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12388/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12388/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12388/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12388","id":170482263,"number":12388,"title":"loading cursor symbol in i3wm because there is no startup-notification for atom","user":{"login":"SpikePy","id":16565183,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/16565183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpikePy","html_url":"https://github.com/SpikePy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpikePy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpikePy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpikePy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpikePy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpikePy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpikePy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpikePy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpikePy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpikePy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":97577987,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/linux","name":"linux","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-08-10T18:11:52Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T19:10:29Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T19:10:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [ ] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nif you use atom in i3wm and exit it, you will always see a mouse symbol for waiting/loading because atom does not use the startup-notification?!

All this suggestion should really add is a way to prevent closing a tab when Atom reached the 'WillDestroy' state.\n\n**Why would the enhancement be useful to most users**\n\nIt will mostly be useful for people that want to create a package that in one way or another have 'priority' tabs that they don't want to be closed when for example the close-all-tabs command is fired.\n\n**Atom Version:** 1.9.7\n**OS and Version:** Windows 10\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12375","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12375/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12375/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12375/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12375","id":170245323,"number":12375,"title":"Trigger grammar-used hooks no matter how text editors are created","user":{"login":"maxbrunsfeld","id":326587,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/326587?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld","html_url":"https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-08-09T19:04:40Z","updated_at":"2016-08-09T20:19:34Z","closed_at":"2016-08-09T20:19:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/12375","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12375","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12375.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12375.patch"},"body":"Fixes https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12333\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12375/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12374","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12374/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12374/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12374/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12374","id":170216212,"number":12374,"title":"AltGr is not Alt","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-08-09T16:50:14Z","updated_at":"2016-08-09T18:12:22Z","closed_at":"2016-08-09T16:56:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello,\n\nit might only be a problem of a de-de keyboard but if I can not press AltGr+ß then I can not get a \\.

fixes a regression introduced in #12350 that was preventing Atom from starting after running `script/build`. Specifically, we were still transpiling coffee script files located in the `exports` directory, ignoring all the javascript assets inside of it, thereby causing the output application to not contain the Atom exports file and to throw an exception on startup. To fix this, we have replaced coffee script transpilation with babel transpilation for `export/**/*.js` files.\n\n/cc: @maxbrunsfeld @mnquintana @CraZySacX\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12371/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12370","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12370/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12370/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12370/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12370","id":170103246,"number":12370,"title":"Using CTRL+CMD+Down Arrow to move code down results in an error sound","user":{"login":"simonbingham","id":1306644,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1306644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbingham","html_url":"https://github.com/simonbingham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbingham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbingham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbingham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbingham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbingham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbingham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbingham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbingham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbingham/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-08-09T07:53:24Z","updated_at":"2016-08-09T13:35:30Z","closed_at":"2016-08-09T13:35:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nUsing CTRL+CMD+Down Arrow to move selected code down results in an error sound.
