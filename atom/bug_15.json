Install latest [KDE Neon](https://neon.kde.org/develop) GNU/Linux distribution (Either should be fine)\r\n2. Install atom / atom beta (ditto behavior)\r\n3. Possibly copy my editor setup using [my config](https://pastebin.com/NWN5GAFh), or even [my styles](https://pastebin.com/4b60zAFr)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Tab size isn't autoindented to 1 space and using the autoindent editor command makes an effect after changing the tab size and/or type.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Tab size is stuck at 1 space. Using hard tabs and **only manually indenting** all of every file will yield me the desired tab size at the expense of having to use hard tabs. \r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Indefinitely\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n> ` atom --version && apm --version && atom-beta --version`\r\nAtom    : 1.19.0\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\napm  1.18.2\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.12\r\ngit 2.7.4\r\nAtom    : 1.20.0-beta0\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\n`uname -romi`\r\n4.10.0-32-generic x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n`lsb_release -a`\r\nNo LSB modules are available.\r\nDistributor ID: neon\r\nDescription:    KDE neon Developer Edition\r\nRelease:        16.04\r\nCodename:       xenial\r\n`kf5-config --version`\r\nQt: 5.9.1\r\nKDE Frameworks: 5.37.0\r\nkf5-config: 1.0\r\n`plasmashell --version`\r\nplasmashell 5.10.4\r\n`kwin --version`\r\nkwin 5.10.4\r\n`krunner --version`\r\nkrunner 5.10.4\r\n`kded5 --version`\r\nkded5 5.37.0\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nPlease offer me any other workarounds.

This meant that tools like the `coffeelint` and `standard` integrations for Atom couldn't find those binaries from `src/`, `spec/`, etc and either fell back to bundled or global versions (as did Atom's `linter-coffeescript`) which mismatched the lcoal installation, or simply failed silently (as with `linter-js-standard` and `linter-js-standard-engine`).\n\nThis change makes the correct versions available to these tools, and they remain accessible from `scripts/` so long as the root as its dependencies installed.\n\nSomewhat unrelated: would you be opposed to me documenting my experience getting Atom dev up and running in a section next to `Building` in the project README?
