Still, it has been bugging me and I feel the urge to report it.\r\n1. I cannot find the \"Atom.io\" tile in the \"Start Screen\". I can find it\r\nin the \"Apps & features\" list, but I cannot start it. \"Cortana\" does not find it\r\neither - silly girl, she just finds the \"Atomic Clock\" app in the \"Store\".\r\nThe only workaround that I have found for this issue has been to pin\r\nits tile to the task bar on the first run. This is not acceptable, but at least\r\nI can start it. I prefer not to go and find the executable binary file.\r\n2. The same issue described at (1) has also been previously happening\r\nwith the \"GitHub Desktop\" app, that initially was not to be found anywhere.\r\nThe workaround for it has been to go to the https://www.github.com/ web page\r\nin the \"Microsoft Edge\" web browser and then to open a repository from it\r\nby switching to the \"GitHub Desktop\" app.\r\nHowever, this issue has been miraculously solved in the meantime\r\nand the \"GitHub Desktop\" tile is now found by \"Cortana\", but it does not appear\r\nin the \"Start Screen\" yet.\r\nEven if I can start the \"GitHub Desktop\" app right now, still it does not\r\nfind the \"Atom.io\" editor, although I must have reinstalled it at least\r\ntwo times already by now.\r\n3. The updating system has a strange behavior. In order to install\r\nthe latest update (1.19.7 x64), I had to turn off \"Symantec\"'s \"Norton Security\r\nOnline\" app. It is reporting a \"SONAR\" behavior.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n\"Microsoft Windows\" Version 17603 (Operating System Build 15063.540) x64 © 2017\r\n\r\n\"GitHub Desktop\" App Version 0.8.0\r\n\r\n\"Atom.io\" Editor App Version 1.19.6 x64\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15599/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15598","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15598/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15598/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15598/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15598","id":256456098,"number":15598,"title":"[WIP] Do not normalize C: to C:.","user":{"login":"50Wliu","id":2766036,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2766036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu","html_url":"https://github.com/50Wliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722947,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/work-in-progress","name":"work-in-progress","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-09-09T18:12:36Z","updated_at":"2017-09-11T12:06:54Z","closed_at":"2017-09-11T12:06:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/15598","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15598","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15598.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15598.patch"},"body":"### Requirements\r\n\r\n* Filling out the template is required.

Turns out that Chromium/macOS switches between a light and dark handle based on the `background-color` of the element that has `overflow` scrolling enabled. Unfortunately we can't just add a background color to the scrollbars of `atom-text-editor` because it would cover the code underneath.\r\n\r\nAs a potential solution, this PR adds the syntax background color to scrollbars initially only for a very short time through a keyframe animation and then removes the background color again. This will have the effect that the scrollbars still pick up the right syntax background color and adjust the handle accordingly for dark themes.\r\n\r\nBefore | After\r\n--- | ---\r\n![screen shot 2017-09-09 at 12 47 01 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/378023/30237351-0f84751c-956b-11e7-9e26-2c80e072a3be.png) | ![screen shot 2017-09-09 at 12 46 02 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/378023/30237353-1158c226-956b-11e7-8445-4a63ac286798.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nInstead of an animation (adding and removing the background color) we could also keep an almost transparent background color, like `background-color: fade(@syntax-background-color, 0.01%);`. It won't be visible by eye. But using an animation feels still slightly better since it's more temporarily. \r\n\r\nAnother alternative would be to implement our own custom scrollbars, but that's much bigger in scope.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nSince all dark themes are affected.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nBetter buffer scrollbar handle contrast for dark themes.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nA keyframe animation might have negative side effects on the buffer, like causing repaint or so. /cc @nathansobo @as-cii \r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nFixes #15401","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15596/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":4}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15595","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15595/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15595/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15595/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15595","id":256315656,"number":15595,"title":"Warning: IntersectionObserver.observe(target): target element is not a descendant of root","user":{"login":"caleb531","id":872474,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/872474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caleb531","html_url":"https://github.com/caleb531","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caleb531/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caleb531/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caleb531/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caleb531/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caleb531/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caleb531/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caleb531/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caleb531/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caleb531/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-09-08T17:04:38Z","updated_at":"2017-09-08T17:22:30Z","closed_at":"2017-09-08T17:20:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [X] Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis issue is described in [this comment](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12606#issuecomment-261925330) and [this comment](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12606#issuecomment-282014042) on issue #12606, but is distinct from that issue.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, after updating Atom in the background, if the editor is not restarted, files opened in Windows Explorer will open in a new window (the updated instance) and cannot be dragged to the originally opened Atom window (the still running \"old\" instance).\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n- open Atom editor and pin it into the taskbar\r\n- wait for an update\r\n- open Atom from taskbar\r\n- now open any file from explorer (dont drag&drop it into the editor, just double-click)\r\n- new instance of Atom will open, tabs from this instance cannot be dragged to original instance\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Atom should probably restart itself after updating on Windows.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** See Description above\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Always, so

Would somebody with more knowledge please explain.\r\n\r\nGiven the string `$foo = \"foobar\";`, using the PHP grammar, and placing the cursor directly before the first opening quote character.\r\n\r\nIf I call `editor.scopeDescriptorForBufferPosition(point)`, the scopes returned will include `string.quoted.double.php`. Yet, If I call `editor.bufferRangeForScopeAtPosition('string.quoted.double.php', point)`, it will return `undefined`. There appears to be a disparity between the two calls.\r\n\r\nIf this is intended behaviour, I can code around it. I'm just worried this is something that will change, breaking my code.\r\n\r\n###

This package has zero documentation and appears to not be maintained. \r\n\r\nThe functionality provided by this tiny package is just a single command to reset the buffered text to the content saved on disk. I am quite surprised this functionality is not already in core. We shouldn't need to install a package to do this. \r\n\r\nAtom should move this to core and make it available to various menus and deal with any open issues brought up on that package's repo.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** \r\nOpening `File` menu or context clicking on a file in `Tree View` or typing `\"revert` into `Command Palette` displays an option to revert file to it's saved state. `File` menu and `Command Palette` also displays the wisely selected default hotkey for this command.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\nIn order to revert file to saved, I must close and reopen the file or install the undocumented and poorly interfaced `revert-buffer` package.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\n100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nWindows:    10\r\nAtom    : 1.19.6\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\napm  1.18.4\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython\r\ngit 2.12.0.windows.1\r\nvisual studio\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nNone\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15586/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15585","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15585/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15585/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15585/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15585","id":256015134,"number":15585,"title":"Scrollbar moves to the top when splitting panes","user":{"login":"Ben3eeE","id":1058982,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1058982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben3eeE","html_url":"https://github.com/Ben3eeE","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben3eeE/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben3eeE/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben3eeE/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben3eeE/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben3eeE/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben3eeE/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben3eeE/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben3eeE/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben3eeE/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":505038679,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-09-07T17:35:12Z","updated_at":"2017-09-07T17:35:12Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [X] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n![scrollbar position](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1058982/30176488-e483daf6-9402-11e7-9fb0-726733af7856.gif)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

If its value is `true`, it means that the block decoration has been accounted for in the `lineTopIndex` and must, as a result, be cleaned up in case the marker or the decoration gets destroyed.\r\n\r\n/cc: @nathansobo @Ben3eeE @lgeiger @rsese @ungb","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15583/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15582","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15582/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15582/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15582/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15582","id":255961380,"number":15582,"title":"[1.19.6/1.20.0-beta6] Block decorations mess up editor content when destroyed","user":{"login":"lgeiger","id":13285808,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/13285808?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgeiger","html_url":"https://github.com/lgeiger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgeiger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgeiger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgeiger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgeiger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgeiger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgeiger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgeiger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgeiger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgeiger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":418477269,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/regression","name":"regression","color":"b60205","default":false},{"id":505038679,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-09-07T14:42:31Z","updated_at":"2017-09-07T19:33:50Z","closed_at":"2017-09-07T16:43:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

first I believed that [these span elements were redundant](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/text-editor-component.js#L3883-L3884), however after discussion with @as-cii it came out that it is being used for [measuring the total length of the line](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/a53958e00742b24aa0ebf47e264c46094c5c6c9b/src/text-editor-component.js#L2195), so they cannot be removed
