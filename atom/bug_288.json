I see 2 things for now:\n- The template ability: in Vim, you can set up a template for each type file. Ex: you can set up a template for python files. When you create a file with the command `vim test.py`, test.py comes with some basic lines inside, like the shebang and the encoding. I've been looking around (maybe not enough), I found nothing about a similar stuff\n- The sidebar: is it possible to display something else than a filebrowser in the sidebar ?
