the damage to the partition with `fsck`) appears to fix the issue.~~\n\nAfter further testing the problem also occurs even if I completely delete the `.atom` folder and let Atom recreate a new one.\n\nOutput from `dmesg` confirming the corruption can be found below:\n\n```\n[   54.443923] EXT4-fs error (device sda4): ext4_ext_check_inode:495: inode #128152: comm atom: pblk 0 bad
