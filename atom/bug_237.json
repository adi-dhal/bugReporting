Similar to going back and forth in a web browser.\n- Selecting code and easily collapsing it using a shortcut or an easy to find button.\n\nSo while Espresso is lacking the above features I am wondering how Atom does this in a simple to find way? As I have downloaded Atom and find myself in a maze not knowing where to go next. Feeling the learning curve or seemingly large learning curve based on available options seen in the various sub menu items. Too many options. There really should be a basic and an advanced view mode. As one begins the basic view is seen with the \"most\" used features. Then go to preferences to turn on advanced view.\n\nps I mainly use Espresso for editing the CSS stylesheet style.css and the functions.php file in my WordPress child themes. If you have tips for using Atom with WordPress that would also be appreciated.

Currently, they are styled with `display: inline-block` so that they have the same height of line nodes. This produces the effect of a contiguous vertical line:\n\n![screen shot 2015-09-07 at 14 21 42](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/9716625/e2fdfa22-556b-11e5-93cf-7401d0a130fc.png)\n\nMy assumption is that, when rendering text runs, Chrome has to take a slightly different route to lay out inline blocks, thereby slowing down reflows.\n\nAs a result, if we use `display: inline` for indent guides as well, **Layout** decreases from `3.2ms – 3.5ms` to `2.0ms – 2.5ms` for a full reflow. This, however, has the consequence of showing indent guides as the following:\n\n![screen shot 2015-09-07 at 14 25 59](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/9716677/630db856-556c-11e5-9dc6-ab0363208af5.png)\n\nI have worked with @simurai to find a performant replacement which didn't alter the UI, but we had no luck in our investigation. We might probably render indent guides _outside_ the line, but I am not sure it's really worth it, especially since users may be okay with the slowdown and still keep the contiguous line effect with a simple change in their stylesheet:\n\n``` less\natom-text-editor::shadow .indent-guide {\n  display: inline-block;\n}\n```\n\nWhat do you think? :thought_balloon:\n\nThanks!\n\n/cc: @nathansobo @atom/feedback \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8699","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8699/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8699/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8699/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8699","id":105201121,"number":8699,"title":"Add \"Continuous Reflow\" mode","user":{"login":"as-cii","id":482957,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/482957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii","html_url":"https://github.com/as-cii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2015-09-07T11:45:40Z","updated_at":"2015-09-17T16:46:48Z","closed_at":"2015-09-17T16:46:43Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/8699","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8699","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8699.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8699.patch"},"body":"When this option is enabled, we reflow lines and line numbers at a minimum interval rate of `200ms`, similarly to Chrome's **Continuous Repaint** feature. If another frame is requested in the meantime, we dispatch it anyways but still reflow everything.\n\nThis feature is particularly useful to inspect **Layout** and **Recalculate Styles**, possibly tracking down performance issues related to them. A typical workflow to inspect slow styles would look like the following:\n1. Settings -> Enable continuous reflow\n2. Open the document you'd like to inspect\n3. Record a few seconds with the Timeline\n4. Open your personal stylesheet\n5. Add/Remove styles\n6. Go to 2)\n\nPlease, note that reflowing happens only when the editor is focused (so to avoid noise from benchmarking multiple editors at once).\n\nI am a bit unsure we should expose this as a user-facing setting: it would probably be okay to show it only when dev mode is enabled.

I made the early mistake of basing Atom's initial view system, SpacePen, on jQuery, which solves a lot of problems that aren't at all relevant when targeting a single, modern browser engine. Last summer we removed the reliance on jQuery from Atom's public API and setup a pretty complicated layer of shims to keep the old jQuery-based views working through the deprecation period. With that finally behind us, this PR will remove jQuery and SpacePen entirely. We'll need to transition bundled packages away from SpacePen to finally get the benefit of reduced require time by not loading jQuery, but this is a first step.\n\nSome things to note:\n- Our default tooltips are based on bootstrap, which ships its tooltip support as a jQuery plugin. I reworked their code to remove the dependency on jQuery, which could _slightly_ alter a couple corners of the API. It would be great if people could help me test that the new tooltips work correctly in all cases.\n- Some of our rarely used global spec helpers have been removed.\n- The last incomplete step is to switch our test reporter from SpacePen to raw DOM APIs.\n\nI do worry that old packages that depend on jQuery _might_ break in unforeseen ways, since we were augmenting the jQuery that shipped with SpacePen with extra stuff. For example, we had shimmed `trigger` to run Atom commands, but that no longer works. I'm not totally sure what's going to happen, but most packages developed in newer styles should have nothing to do with this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8680/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4915","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"CCF9:4298:2C7E36:65C07A:59D92AA4","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=238>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=236>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"00d7af5d87629f2e8d8eb93d8e4c34e7\"","status":"200 OK"}}
