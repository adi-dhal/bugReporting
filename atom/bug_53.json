Open Atom and some file in it\r\n2. Switch focus to another program window (even another Atom window)\r\n3. Switch back\r\n4. Switch focus to another program window (even another Atom window)\r\n5. .atom/storage/application.json gets updated (just new timestamp) even though the list of opened \"initialPaths\" stays the same\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** \r\nFile application.json should be updated only when there is a change to it's content or when Atom is closing.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** \r\nFile application.json gets updated at every focus switch even though there is no change of it's content.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions \r\nI am now on version below running Fedora 25, but it happens since I started using Atom two years ago on Fedora 21.

http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\nI did everything except the \"Safe Mode\" because I can't reproduce the problem constantly and I'm not able to run Atom in safe mode all the day.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen I open a file doing `cmd` + clicking on a file path in iTerm 2, some times (once a day?) a white window of Atom opens, the \"custom titlebar\" gets disabled, and I see a new Atom icon in the Dock.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the Atom icon in the Dock is different from the custom one I have assigned to my

Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [X] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: \r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: \r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions:\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: \r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nNow that [WSL/Windows Interop is officially released](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/interop), would be good to update the Windows Atom wrapper scripts. \r\n\r\nWhen running \"atom\" or \"apm\" inside bash.exe (Windows Creators Update Build 15063.138) the WSL environment isn't detected by the scripts inside %UserProfile%\\AppData\\Local\\atom\\bin\r\n\r\nWSL's bash.exe environment will call the shell script (as opposed to batch files) by default\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open the WSL environment (<kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> + <kbd>`bash.exe`</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>)\r\n2. Inside WSL environment, open Atom (<kbd>`atom.exe`</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Expected atom and/or apm to work normally\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** \r\n\r\n**ATOM**\r\n```\r\n/mnt/c/Users/ryan/AppData/Local/atom/bin/../app-1.16.0/resources/cli/atom.sh: line 9: pwd: -W: invalid option\r\npwd: usage: pwd [-LP]\r\n'/atom.cmd' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\r\noperable program or batch file.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**APM**\r\n\r\n```\r\n/mnt/c/Users/ryan/AppData/Local/atom/bin/../app-1.16.0/resources/cli/../app/apm/bin/apm: line 37: /mnt/c/Users/ryan/AppData/Local/atom/app-1.16.0/resources/app/apm/bin/node: No such file or directory\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Every time\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\n % **atom --version**\r\nAtom    : 1.16.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\n % **apm --version**\r\nMicrosoft Windows [Version 10.0.15063]\r\napm  1.16.1\r\nnpm  3.10.5\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython\r\ngit 2.10.2.windows.1\r\nvisual studio 2015\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nFor now, it's easy enough to work around this issue by creating an alias in your WSL shell, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nalias atom='cmd.exe /C C:\\\\Users\\\\ExampleUser\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\atom\\\\bin\\\\atom.cmd'\r\nalias apm='cmd.exe /C C:\\\\Users\\\\ExampleUser\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\atom\\\\bin\\\\apm.cmd'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeally we could rewrite the wrapper files for the Windows package of Atom to work seamlessly whether running from the Start Menu, cmd.exe, bash.exe, or any of the other Cygwin derived environments. Over the near term, I expect that WSL will replace all of the Cygwin derived environments, greatly simplifying most users development environments.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14258/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14257","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14257/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14257/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14257/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14257","id":222693543,"number":14257,"title":"Atom 1.16.0 does crash on start on UBuntu 16.04","user":{"login":"henning","id":40272,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/40272?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/henning","html_url":"https://github.com/henning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":153145129,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/crash","name":"crash","color":"e11d21","default":false},{"id":97577987,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/linux","name":"linux","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2017-04-19T10:35:52Z","updated_at":"2017-04-20T14:38:25Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

This should help our build queue situation somewhat.\r\n\r\nNote that _pull request_ builds should still be triggered on all three systems.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nWe could do this by adding logic to the build scripts themselves to detect when they're being executed on a branch build that will also create a PR build, but there's no reason not to use the built-in solutions for this.\r\n\r\nAppVeyor and (I believe) Circle both allow you to configure this setting in their own web UIs. I generally prefer to keep build configuration within the repository as much as possible, though, it's less confusing and we can manage it with pull requests (like this one!).\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nThe core build metadata files are in core :grin:\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nThis will decrease the extraneous builds that are created when maintainers push branches to the atom/atom fork and create pull requests from them, which is [common in our workflow](https://github.com/atom/atom/branches/all). This results in _two_ builds for each push to a feature branch: one from the push to the feature branch and one from the pull request event:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"694\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-04-18 at 12 54 21 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17565/25142789/2ab061c6-2436-11e7-8ca7-146a88846b10.png\">\r\n\r\nRunning fewer builds will result in less queue pressure and more rapid feedback on changes.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nRunning the tests less often may cause us to miss flaky failures that happen only occasionally. We will also lose the ability to distinguish failures that are present on the branch itself (from the branch build) from those that are caused by the merge into master (from the pull request build).\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\n_N/A_\r\n\r\nWe've agreed to hold off on changing the build for a day or so to more easily isolate the cause of any problems from #13646.\r\n\r\n/cc @damieng @as-cii @maxbrunsfeld @50Wliu \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14250/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14249","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14249/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14249/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14249/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14249","id":222481074,"number":14249,"title":"Update languages","user":{"login":"50Wliu","id":2766036,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2766036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu","html_url":"https://github.com/50Wliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-04-18T16:57:14Z","updated_at":"2017-04-19T17:19:06Z","closed_at":"2017-04-19T17:19:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/14249","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14249","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14249.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14249.patch"},"body":"### Requirements\r\n\r\n* Filling out the template is required.

This functionality is common in other editors, such as sublime and emacs\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nNo alternates. Some people have suggested using the 'atom:' scheme, however that is already in use for packages. WizardOfOgz has made a [script](https://github.com/WizardOfOgz/atom-handler) to act like a wrapper around atom, essentially translating a URI scheme to a file and passing it to atom.\r\n\r\nSome notable discussions requesting such a feature:\r\nhttps://discuss.atom.io/t/atom-protocol-handler/13336\r\nAlso see issue #2037 \r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nThis can not be implemented in a package as it is, by design, core behaviour.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nThis shall allow files to be opened by URL. \r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nIn my personal use-case, I will be using the PHP Whoops package to handle exceptions in web-development. It will present me with a page with a URL to the file/line/column which I can then click and it will open it straight in the atom editor at the exact point at which the error occured.\r\n\r\n### Still to be done\r\n * [x] Register atm handler with windows - **UNTESTED**\r\n \r\n* [x] Register atm handler with OSX\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14243/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14242","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14242/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14242/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14242/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14242","id":222295671,"number":14242,"title":"Saving and renaming different files causes conflict","user":{"login":"jeffswt","id":18145331,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/18145331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffswt","html_url":"https://github.com/jeffswt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffswt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffswt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffswt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffswt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffswt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffswt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffswt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffswt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffswt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":505038679,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-04-18T04:04:46Z","updated_at":"2017-04-18T15:16:20Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nFile handle conflict detecting file renames, when saving and renaming files at the same time.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. <del>Open a file named `fft.cpp`.</del>\r\n2. <del>Create another empty file, enter something in it, and open the \"Save File\" dialog, but do not save the file at the moment.</del>\r\n3. <del>Rename the file `fft.cpp` into `fft2.cpp`.</del>\r\n4. <del>Save the newly opened file to the same folder, and call it `fft.cpp`.
