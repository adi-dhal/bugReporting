if we have custom git-repo implementation in packages, let it override the default one (it's implementing the same interfaces anyway) or let's change Promise.all logic to step-by-step one - it will be slower to resolve repo provider for project, but we will ensure that we tried to use custom provider before GitRepository one. I'm ready to provide pull request for review for any solution you will choose of these two.\n\nOtherwise, it will make implementing custom git repository impossible or we'll have to :ship: our own version of Atom if we need one.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10423/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10422","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10422/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10422/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10422/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10422","id":126738924,"number":10422,"title":"ctrl-alt-shift-a doesn't register as a hotkey","user":{"login":"SlimeQ","id":3934698,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3934698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimeQ","html_url":"https://github.com/SlimeQ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimeQ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimeQ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimeQ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimeQ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimeQ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimeQ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimeQ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimeQ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimeQ/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-01-14T20:13:07Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T21:09:12Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T21:09:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"when i upgraded to 1.3.0 i somehow lost my custom ctrl-alt-shift-a hotkey. my keybinding resolver shows ctrl-alt-shift-<something_else> works, but when ctrl-alt-shift is pressed it does not detect A for some reason.\n\nUbuntu 14.04, Atom 1.3-1.4\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10422/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10421","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10421/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10421/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10421/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10421","id":126723760,"number":10421,"title":"CPU pegged at 100% in due to .git directory in home directory","user":{"login":"leejoramo","id":903279,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/903279?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leejoramo","html_url":"https://github.com/leejoramo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leejoramo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leejoramo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leejoramo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leejoramo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leejoramo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leejoramo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leejoramo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leejoramo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leejoramo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-01-14T19:03:43Z","updated_at":"2016-01-14T19:05:42Z","closed_at":"2016-01-14T19:05:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Atom has always been a performance disaster on my MacBook. I give it a try with each major release and watch Atom use 100% CPU and keep eating over 2GB of RAM.\n\nAfter a long exchange on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10901691) about the current version 1.4 release, I dug deeper and ended up finding a [solution buried](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3426#issuecomment-119780457) in several other issues posted here. \n\nI had long ago accidentally created a .git directory in my home directory. This caused Atom to process my entire 350GB home directory. Deleting ~/.git and restarting Atom solved the problem. \n\nI am sure what the underlining technical issue is here. Why should Atom process the entire home directory. \n- If this is a _bug_, it should be fixed. \n- If this is a _feature_, a warning should be provided to users that their home directory contains a .git folder, which will hinder performance. Perhaps with the ability to disable the feature. \n- This issue should be more easily found in documentation, FAQ, trouble shoting. It actually took me two hours today to track this down, and this is after nearly two years of not using Atom because it was a  resource hog. \n\nI am sure many people have accidentally (or intensionally) created a ~/.git directory at some.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10420","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10420/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10420/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10420/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10420","id":126714745,"number":10420,"title":"Feature request: base64 previews","user":{"login":"dbkaplun","id":1765130,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1765130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkaplun","html_url":"https://github.com/dbkaplun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkaplun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkaplun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkaplun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkaplun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkaplun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkaplun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkaplun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkaplun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkaplun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true},{"id":193722938,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/package-idea","name":"package-idea","color":"bfd4f2","default":false},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-01-14T18:16:08Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T21:09:02Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T21:09:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Would be nice to have previews for base64 blobs.

However,</strike> I think it would be great to have the option to indent newlines to exactly match the indentation of the above line, but then not do anything further.\n\n<strike>In the worst case, I've had the auto indent increase indentation for every new line, which I've then had to remove (I think when working with mixed languages in the same file).</strike> It is more often the case I want the indentation the same on a newline and am happy to change it myself at the start and end of blocks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10408/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10407","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10407/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10407/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10407/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10407","id":126579484,"number":10407,"title":"indentation being changed on paste despite auto indent on paste unchecked","user":{"login":"pknowles","id":2234066,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2234066?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/pknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pknowles/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":155497904,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/auto-indent","name":"auto-indent","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-01-14T05:17:53Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T22:09:07Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T22:09:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have both Editor Settings->Auto Indent and Editor Settings->Auto Indent On Paste unchecked and start with a new plain text file (using hard tabs):\n\n```\none\n    two\n```\n\nwhere `two` is indented with a tab. I place the cursor at the end of `two`, hold shift, press up and copy the selection. This _should_ copy a newline character, a tab character and the word `two`, i.e. `\"\\n\\ttwo\"`. Then I paste, and get this:\n\n```\none\n    two\n        two\n```\n\nsomehow an extra tab has been injected. Additional pasting increases the indentation even further! I expected this:\n\n```\none\n    two\n    two\n```\n\nInterestingly, if `one` is also indented before copying, the correct behaviour is observed. It's as though atom is counting the difference in indentation between the lines selected when the text is copied. Personally I hate anything that tries to be too fancy and automatic, and it is _far_ more frustrating to me than the times when something could have predicted what I wanted and didn't.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10407/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10406","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10406/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10406/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10406/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10406","id":126574373,"number":10406,"title":"Uncaught Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users/tuneonmymind/.atom/keymap.cson'","user":{"login":"whereismymind7","id":748933,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/748933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/whereismymind7","html_url":"https://github.com/whereismymind7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whereismymind7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whereismymind7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whereismymind7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whereismymind7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whereismymind7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whereismymind7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whereismymind7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whereismymind7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whereismymind7/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-01-14T04:21:39Z","updated_at":"2016-12-15T15:43:24Z","closed_at":"2016-12-15T15:43:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello.
