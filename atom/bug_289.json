Yes, we can reduce this overhead and plan to do so, but it's also true that these features are less likely to be critical when editing really huge files. So this PR disables them for files above 2MB.\n\nIn return we can do the following:\n- Compute placeholder `TokenizedLine`s on demand instead of up-front. This skips all of the processing I was trying to perform in the background on #7060, which can now be closed. It also avoids the memory hit of storing horizontal spatial metadata for any lines we haven't yet viewed. I'm leaving lines cached once we compute them once to avoid creating the same line over and over again. We could potentially use an LRU (\"least recently used\") cache eviction strategy if we want to cap consumed memory, but I'm not sure it's worth prioritizing.\n- Delegate straight through to `TokenizedBuffer` from `DisplayBuffer` rather than storing a second copy of lines, since there are no folds and soft wraps. This isn't a huge win but it does avoid an extra potentially huge array of references.\n- Not block the UI thread as we perform the initial tokenization. This is really long overdue to be backgrounded, but this is a good stopgap.\n### Metrics\n\nNow that we've cleared a huge bottleneck, new bottlenecks are revealing themselves in the initial load of a large file. At least on an SSD, I/O really isn't high on the list yet. Here's a flame graph for loading that 18.5 MB file:\n\n<img width=\"1318\" alt=\"screenshot_2015-06-05_22_11_18\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1789/8014847/6b37b540-0bd4-11e5-94f9-0d91da9083e6.png\">\n\nThere's plenty of low hanging :apple: in here. I've highlighted a few things that stood out to me.\n\n@maxbrunsfeld: `TextBuffer` might be a good first candidate for `Patch` after all, at least in terms of getting that data structure optimized for insertion. `SpanSkipList` insertion is by far the biggest remaining cost.\n\nFrom a memory perspective, the `SpanSkipList` is also our biggest offender when `TokenizedLine`s are out of the way:\n\n![screenshot 2015-06-05 22 10 07](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1789/8014925/f7aff92e-0bd4-11e5-8777-73d92bdfe6ad.png)\n### Closing Thoughts\n\nI still want to push the efficiency of the structures that support Atom's full feature set, and we have a bunch of ideas for how to do so. But in the meantime, this is a much better compromise than an error message.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7130/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7129","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7129/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7129/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7129/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/7129","id":85627973,"number":7129,"title":"Avoid redundant decoration state updates in presenter","user":{"login":"maxbrunsfeld","id":326587,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/326587?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld","html_url":"https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-06-05T20:39:22Z","updated_at":"2015-06-05T21:06:12Z","closed_at":"2015-06-05T21:06:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/7129","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/7129","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/7129.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/7129.patch"},"body":"In #7023, when we switched to a fully batched system of computing decoration states, I neglected to remove a couple of unnecessary incremental decoration state updates.

merging #6733 there have been [some reports of text looking blurred](https://discuss.atom.io/t/text-rendering-seems-blurry-compared-to-other-editors/13927/15). The reason for that is we started rendering tiles with a transparent background: this doesn't play well with Chrome, which disables sub pixel rendering, thereby making text less crisp.\n\nThis PR attempts to bring text clarity back. It's a bit more cumbersome than it seems on the surface because, in order to make tiles opaque, we need to distribute highlights across tiles. We plan to :ship: this in time for the next release and so it's quite urgent. :warning: \n\nIf anyone wants to give feedback meanwhile we make progress on this it would be highly appreciated! The code still needs to be polished, but feature-wise everything should already work as expected.\n\nThanks to anyone who will take the time to have a look! :bow: \n\n/cc: @atom/feedback
