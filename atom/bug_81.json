a question: can Atom \"replace\" the presentation (display) of certain text patterns while keeping the underlying char sequences intact?\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I'm wondering if it would be possible for a package to imitate Spacemacs Clojure layer's fancify-symbols [feature](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/c788da709bb1c74344f5ab1b6f18cfdf6b930df8/layers/%2Blang/clojure/funcs.el#L12). What it does is replace instances of the `fn`, `partial`, `comp`, `#()`, `#{}` keywords and literals with the symbols `λ`, `Ƥ`, `∘`, `ƒ`, `∈`, respectively. The substitutions are done _as you type_.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate:\r\n```clojure\r\n;; Insertion\r\n(fn_\r\n(λ _\r\n(λ [] (partial_\r\n(λ [] (Ƥ _\r\n(λ [] (Ƥ (comp_\r\n(λ [] (Ƥ (∘ _\r\n(λ [] (Ƥ (∘

change:\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3883359/20952885/d5af4570-bc2f-11e6-89f7-ffe0842c970c.png)\r\n\r\nAnd there is still old directory on the right

Unfortunately, electron doesn't have APIs for that.\r\n\r\nThings I have tried:\r\n1) Electron has `browserWindow.webContents.invalidate()` and `.on('paint' -> ...)` but it only works with offscreen rendering which     atom doesn't use.\r\n2) `.capturePage(-> ...)` takes a screenshot of the page and I hoped it     would do a flush first but it inconsistently displays the highlight     so it won't work.\r\n3) `Using setTimeout((-> ...), 16)` works many times but not always\r\n4) `requestAnimationFrame(-> ...)` should be what we want but unfortunately     it doesn't always show the highlights :(\r\n\r\nWhat I found worked was to nest three `requestAnimationFrame`, it works all the time even when my machine is busy. This is not a 100% solution but I think that it's okay to assume that if the highlight hasn't been updated in three frames then you should probably try and optimize your code. 3 frames is 50ms and that delay isn't noticeable.\r\n\r\nNote: the proper way to solve this that was mentioned in the issue is to open the menu from the main process but this is already what atom does and it's still an issue.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![](http://g.recordit.co/DruDVLJoN9.gif)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![](http://g.recordit.co/PxBnwNt5yy.gif)\r\n\r\nReleased under CC0","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13397","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13397/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13397/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13397/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13397","id":193819163,"number":13397,"title":"Revert \"Flush DOM before displaying context menu\"","user":{"login":"as-cii","id":482957,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/482957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii","html_url":"https://github.com/as-cii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-12-06T16:30:36Z","updated_at":"2016-12-06T16:32:01Z","closed_at":"2016-12-06T16:30:42Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/13397","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13397","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13397.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13397.patch"},"body":"Reverts atom/atom#13266 as it doesn't address #2991.\r\n\r\n/cc: @vjeux ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13396","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13396/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13396/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13396/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13396","id":193775205,"number":13396,"title":"Large Json on file.json","user":{"login":"AnibalNicolas","id":8043906,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8043906?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnibalNicolas","html_url":"https://github.com/AnibalNicolas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnibalNicolas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnibalNicolas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnibalNicolas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnibalNicolas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnibalNicolas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnibalNicolas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnibalNicolas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnibalNicolas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnibalNicolas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-12-06T13:42:40Z","updated_at":"2016-12-23T20:48:46Z","closed_at":"2016-12-23T20:48:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\r\n\r\nI was working with large jsons (more than 50000 characteres), if you push a json into a single line file with .json extension, the pointer at the end of line is delayed.\r\n\r\nGif to show problem\r\nhttp://gph.is/2h2fu7m\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.
