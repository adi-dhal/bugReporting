Possibly the vertical scrollbar is showing up for a fraction of a second before realizing it's not needed and hiding again.  On occasion, the cursor is also rendered incorrectly.  In the GIF, it is incorrectly appearing as a blue block below the line where the cursor actually is.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThis might be difficult to repro because on my screen there's only two pixels before the scrollbar is required.\r\n\r\n1. Have a file with soft-wrapped lines that _almost_ reaches the threshold necessary for vertical scrollbars to appear\r\n2. Move your cursor around the file, make some random selections, etc.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Editor contents to stay static\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Soft-wrapped lines jump around as the scrollbar appearance is constantly recalculated\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n![uh](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2766036/30564290-d83a26cc-9cc4-11e7-8f96-ac8db91fe700.gif)\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.22.0-dev-b269b2086\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf it's helpful, here's the contents of the file I was working on: https://gist.github.com/50Wliu/6d516fd9b32c1191303a5ac64ff39fe7\r\n\r\n/cc: @nathansobo @ungb","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15685/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15684","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15684/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15684/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15684/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15684","id":258603954,"number":15684,"title":"Too many Atom Helper processes cause the computer to become unresponsive.

I was able to overcome the problem by quickly shut down Atom after login. \r\n\r\nI wonder why the OS does not detect the problem and does something about it.\r\n\r\nIf I run Atom with `atom --safe` I do not have problems.\r\nI am going to selectively disable plugins to find where the problem is.\r\n\r\nBut, whatever the problem is I think Atom should not become a problem for the whole system. \r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ atom --version\r\nAtom    : 1.20.0\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\n\r\n$ apm --version\r\napm  1.18.4\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.10\r\ngit 2.11.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThis is the list of my packages:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCommunity Packages (31) \r\n├── atom-format-lua@0.1.5\r\n├── atom-jade@0.3.0\r\n├── autocomplete-js-import@1.4.0\r\n├── autocomplete-modules@1.7.0\r\n├── busy-signal@1.4.3\r\n├── file-icons@2.1.11\r\n├── git-blame@1.2.2\r\n├── hyperclick@0.1.5\r\n├── incremental-search@5.2.2\r\n├── intentions@1.1.5\r\n├── language-babel@2.74.2\r\n├── language-gherkin@1.0.4\r\n├── language-marko@2.9.4\r\n├── linter\r\n├── linter-eslint@8.2.1\r\n├── linter-htmlhint@1.3.3\r\n├── linter-js-yaml@1.2.7\r\n├── linter-jshint@3.1.5\r\n├── linter-luacheck@2.0.1\r\n├── linter-ui-default\r\n├── markdown-writer@2.7.2\r\n├── mocha-test-runner@1.0.0\r\n├── mocha-ui@0.1.8\r\n├── multi-cursor@2.1.5\r\n├── nuclide-test-runner-jest@0.3.0\r\n├── pigments@0.40.2\r\n├── prettier-atom@0.39.0\r\n├── react@0.16.2 (disabled)\r\n├── tab-switcher@1.5.6 (disabled)\r\n├── tabs-to-spaces@1.0.3\r\n└── tree-view-copy-relative-path@1.2.0\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15684/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15683","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15683/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15683/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15683/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15683","id":258596062,"number":15683,"title":"Allow atom:// urls to be opened from the command line","user":{"login":"dreiss","id":4121,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreiss","html_url":"https://github.com/dreiss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreiss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreiss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreiss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreiss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreiss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreiss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreiss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreiss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dreiss/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-09-18T19:35:20Z","updated_at":"2017-09-19T17:44:55Z","closed_at":"2017-09-19T03:04:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/15683","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15683","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15683.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15683.patch"},"body":"### Requirements\r\n\r\n* All new code requires tests to ensure against regressions\r\n\r\nI would love some guidance on how to write an automated test for this.\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nSome Atom extensions (like Nuclide) have functionality that can only be\r\ntriggered by open-url events, which only work on Mac OS.  With this\r\nchange, `atom://` URLs can be passed on the command-line, and they will\r\nopened with the normal openUrl method on all platforms.\r\n\r\nThis change doesn't set Atom up as the default handler for atom:// urls.\r\nThat will require some platform-specific changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nI considered making a separate option for passing urls (--open-url), but this seems more convenient.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nVery simple change.  Brings the \"open-url\" interface to all platforms.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nWindows and Linux users can easily simulate \"open-url\" events.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nCan't use the atom command line to open a file whose name starts with `atom://`, though you can still use `./atom://foo` or just `atom:/foo`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15683/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15682","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15682/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15682/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15682/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15682","id":258588972,"number":15682,"title":"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot match against 'undefined' or 'null'.","user":{"login":"ivdekov","id":11216936,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/11216936?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivdekov","html_url":"https://github.com/ivdekov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivdekov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivdekov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivdekov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivdekov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivdekov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivdekov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivdekov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivdekov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivdekov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":84710475,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/editor-rendering","name":"editor-rendering","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":171329633,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-reproduction","name":"needs-reproduction","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":211058624,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/uncaught-exception","name":"uncaught-exception","color":"e11d21","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-09-18T19:12:09Z","updated_at":"2017-09-18T22:33:45Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"[Enter steps to reproduce:]\r\n\r\n1.

Once a project folder has been added via this method any other action taken afterward will prompt it to trigger once again, causing a major annoyance.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open Atom\r\n2. Use the Add Project Folder keyboard shortcut once (Ctrl+Shift+A).\r\n3. Open the Command Palette with a keyboard shortcut, Ctrl+Shift+P.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** The Add Project Folder dialog window should appear after the first instance of the keyboard shortcut, but it does not until the Command Palette keyboard shortcut is triggered.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Add Project Folder dialog window only appears after another keyboard shortcut is used.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.20.0\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\n\r\napm  1.18.4\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.13\r\ngit 2.14.1\r\nvisual studio 2015\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI always run Atom in full-screen mode.
