Over the holiday I spent a little time working on a package for generating theme screenshots for atom.io. There wasn't really anyone around on Campfire, so I thought I'd just dig through the docs and code and record my experience as a new package creator. The following is a journal of the early phase of my attempt at writing a package - a lot of the questions I ask were answered later / I worked out, but I thought it might be interesting to share.\n\n---\n\nMy first reaction is \"oh dear, spacepen uses a HAML-esque markup system\". This is a personal preference, obviously, not a defect.\n\nThe \"first package\" docs mention changing the name of the command from toggle to something else in the view.coffee, but :toggle appears several other places in the generated code\n\nAfter a little experimentation, it seems the minimum acceptable view component of my viewless package is this:\n\n``` coffeescript\n  @content: ->\n    @div class: 'theme-screenshot', =>\n```\n\nDo I have to bind commands to view methods? My main action doesn't really do anything with the elements that the view is bound to. Shouldn't this be on the theme screenshot module directly? Am I thinking too much in terms of model-view here? Does the \"view\" basically encompass everything a package needs to do?\n\nIs capturePage the same as node-webkit? (no, it provides a SlowBuffer, not a data uri) is it a chromium thing? why can't i find documentation on it anywhere? (ah, it's in atom-shell)\n\nHmm, how do I make sure my node deps will be installed with my package? do i have to just run npm install locally in the package dir as the dependencies change? Shouldn't atom in dev mode make sure the right stuff is installed?\n\nConsole seems to be hanging when I try to set breakpoints / pause on uncaught exceptions.\n\nthe first three bytes of the png buffer are incorrect, then the 4th byte is what the 2nd byte should be and the next 6 are the rest of the correct header. https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/1345 \n\nOh. It's not really a buffer, and I have to use `remote` to make it behave like a buffer. @zcbenz added this to the docs. Should it present itself as a node buffer if it's not really that? \n\nNow that I have clarification on some of these things, package development is pretty smooth. I wish I could require packages in the console though, or at least have access to jquery outside of packages.\n\n---\n\nThat's it - if you're curious, the package so far is here: https://github.com/atom/theme-screenshot but it's really just a few lines of code at the moment, not exactly ready for prime time.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1345","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1345/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1345/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1345/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/1345","id":24853133,"number":1345,"title":"Help me out with capturePage and buffers","user":{"login":"thedaniel","id":1476,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel","html_url":"https://github.com/thedaniel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thedaniel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2013-12-28T23:37:03Z","updated_at":"2013-12-31T01:24:35Z","closed_at":"2013-12-30T18:01:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Not sure if this belongs on atom/atom-shell or here. This is probably more of a story about my lack of understanding about encodings or the node fs api than any defects in software. I'd dig it if someone more versed with either or both would help me understand why I am seeing what I am seeing.\n\nI spent a little bit of time this week playing around with package creation for the first time, as well as `capturePage()`. atom/feedback takes the buffer from `capturePage()` and calls `toString('base64')` on it and sends that to the GH API, which seems to work. As I was fiddling with rectangles to screencapture and so on I thought I'd write to a temp file rather than post every image. \n\nUnfortunately my code is writing corrupt pngs to the file system. The header of the file is almost right, and I can see IHDR and IEND so it's definitely a png, but the first byte (which should be a decimal 137) is replaced by `\\ufffd` which is the UTF8 \"replacement character\", perhaps because it is greater than an signed hex digit can be?\n\nI thought to try a few different encodings but according to the [doc for `fs.writeFile`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_writefile_filename_data_options_callback) says the \"encoding option is ignored if data is a buffer\".\n\nWhat am I doing wrong here? This is the extent of the code:\n\n``` javascript\ntemp = require 'temp'\nfs = require 'fs'\n// 'temp' requirement can be avoided by providing an explicit path instead of info.path\ntemp.open 'screenie', (err, info) ->\n  atom.getCurrentWindow().capturePage {x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 100}, (buf) =>\n    fs.writeFile info.path, buf, (err) ->\n      console.error info.path\n      console.error err\n```\n\n(The [test for capturePage](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/blob/2945e1b50a626e95eedc08cb702aab377515f7e3/spec/api-browser-window-spec.coffee#L79) only tests that a buffer is returned, nothing about the buffer itself)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1344","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1344/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1344/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1344/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/1344","id":24838950,"number":1344,"title":"I wish Command-left-arrow went to column 0 on lines that were all spaces.","user":{"login":"eric","id":470,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/470?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric","html_url":"https://github.com/eric","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2013-12-28T01:03:58Z","updated_at":"2014-01-11T00:28:26Z","closed_at":"2013-12-31T16:50:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I wish Command-left-arrow went to column 0 on lines that were all spaces.\n\nAtom Version: 0.44.0\nUser Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh;

But larger packages that take > 0.5 seconds to load (like [find and replace](https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace/issues/99) become unresponsive for a brief period of time. This could be fixed by ensuring every packages loads quickly, but this isn't realistic because packages created by other people will be out of our control. Another approach would be to intercept all events during package loading and then re-trigger the events after the package is loaded, but this will still feel sluggish and tightly couple the event code to jQuery.\n\nThis prototype pr works like this. If a package has activation events it will load as before, but Atom will also sequentially load these packages each tick. This activates all packages without having a noticeable effect on window load time. The worst case scenario is for a brief time (800ms i this case) the behavior in issue atom/find-and-replace#99 will still occur.\n\nHere is the output of the logs\n\n```\nWindow load time: 1500ms /Users/corey/github/atom/src/window-bootstrap.coffee:23\nDelayed activation of to-the-hubs /Users/corey/github/atom/src/atom-package.coffee:53\nDelayed activation of symbols-view /Users/corey/github/atom/src/atom-package.coffee:53\nDelayed activation of package-generator /Users/corey/github/atom/src/atom-package.coffee:53\nDelayed activation of markdown-preview /Users/corey/github/atom/src/atom-package.coffee:53\nDelayed activation of go-to-line /Users/corey/github/atom/src/atom-package.coffee:53\nDelayed activation of github-sign-in /Users/corey/github/atom/src/atom-package.coffee:53\nDelayed activation of gists /Users/corey/github/atom/src/atom-package.coffee:53\nDelayed activation of find-and-replace /Users/corey/github/atom/src/atom-package.coffee:53\nDelayed activation of command-palette /Users/corey/github/atom/src/atom-package.coffee:53\nDelayed activation of autocomplete /Users/corey/github/atom/src/atom-package.coffee:53\nDelayed activation of autoflow /Users/corey/github/atom/src/atom-package.coffee:53\nTotal delayed activation time: 800.917ms \n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1317/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4671","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"9581:366E:711BF7:EE446F:59D92DF5","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=482>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=480>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"b375a3cce8d877943fd8744125c2428b\"","status":"200 OK"}}
