This causes problems though as if you have multiple instances of something that can call a Task running, and one has the Task it is waiting on a result from killed by `terminate()` there is currently no way to know this has happened. If `Task::cancel()` was part of the public API then caller can listen for the `task:cancelled` event and handle this termination properly (while the other instance that cancelled the task can move on to creating it's own).\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Run a long running Task from something that can be called multiple times.\r\n2. Call the first instance\r\n3. Call the second instance, which calls `terminate()` on the first instances Task\r\n4. Have no way of knowing this has happened in the first instance\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\n\r\nHave a way of knowing the Task has been killed.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\n\r\nThere is no way to know the Task has been killed.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\n\r\n100% of the time.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nNot that this really matters, but:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.16.0-beta0\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14081/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14080","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14080/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14080/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14080/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14080","id":217556243,"number":14080,"title":"Packages preloading","user":{"login":"as-cii","id":482957,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/482957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii","html_url":"https://github.com/as-cii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-03-28T13:16:42Z","updated_at":"2017-04-24T22:39:06Z","closed_at":"2017-04-03T07:59:34Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/14080","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14080","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14080.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14080.patch"},"body":"This pull request aims at reducing bundled packages loading and activation time even further by preloading them. During the snapshot phase, in fact, Atom will now scan all the core packages and load their main module, keymaps, menus, and settings. Later, at runtime, it will finish loading those packages by compiling their style sheets, calling `activate` on them, etc.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this pull request improves the way packages are resolved and, as a result, minimizes the I/O cost associated to it. Previously, in fact, because of the way the code was structured, we would get the list of package directories and constantly issue a `resolvePackagePath` for each of them. This, in turn, would unnecessarily verify again that each path was a directory, thus querying the file system and blocking the main thread. After these changes, we will perform that I/O just once and return a javascript object which contains all the information needed to load the associated package without extra cost.\r\n\r\nOn master, this is how loading and activating packages looks like:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-03-28 at 12 10 41](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/24405701/1c772f16-13c6-11e7-9748-e5fe694c922c.png)\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-03-28 at 12 09 41](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/24405711/2586fa96-13c6-11e7-9ed9-d1c07a17cbb5.png)\r\n\r\nThis is how the same scenario looks like after the changes contained in this pull request:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-03-28 at 12 05 44](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/24405970/fabc0576-13c6-11e7-8c27-d3b07eb1c58a.png)\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-03-28 at 12 07 39](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/24405975/fed3ee6c-13c6-11e7-824d-17f959ccc376.png)\r\n\r\nYou can notice how startup got `~ 90ms` faster, and packages loading alone became almost instantaneous. I am expecting this to be even more noticeable on machines that have slow hard drives, where the cost of I/O is much more dramatic.\r\n\r\nThis marks the end of the first round of performance improvements that can be achieved thanks to snapshots; there are still many things we can improve both in the renderer process and in the browser process, especially related to the scheduling of the tasks that currently happen as part of startup. I believe Atom could be a lot smarter about that, but I am going to illustrate what and how we could make it so in a separate issue (that is going to supplant the now outdated #13253).\r\n\r\n/cc: @atom/maintainers ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14080/reactions","total_count":26,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":6,"confused":0,"heart":14}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14079","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14079/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14079/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14079/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14079","id":217450947,"number":14079,"title":"Atom crashed and leaking memory","user":{"login":"einfallstoll","id":619048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/619048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/einfallstoll","html_url":"https://github.com/einfallstoll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/einfallstoll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/einfallstoll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/einfallstoll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/einfallstoll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/einfallstoll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/einfallstoll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/einfallstoll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/einfallstoll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/einfallstoll/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-03-28T05:21:22Z","updated_at":"2017-03-28T15:33:27Z","closed_at":"2017-03-28T15:33:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

Open attached file and change its extension from `txt` to `md`\r\n2. See how text is rendered in the editor following markdown rules from start to line 35\r\n3. See what happens at line 36: the test suddenly turns pink and stays pink until the end of the document, because of the first underline in  `_search_form.html.erb `\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\n\r\n\r\n1.   _search_form.html.erb should not be treated as a block of text in italics because it starts with underline, unless until a new underline is inserted at the end of the sentence. It does not happen here, in this post, so it should not happen in Atom.\r\n\r\n2. As long as Atoms behaviour differs from markdown editors common behaviour, there should be the opportunity to turn off how Atom render markdown formatting in the editor, like a common markdown editor would do, and let the editor behave as a simple text editor\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\nAtom is conceived to give the user the best experience possible rendering markdown formatting with different colours etc in the editor and this is good. However it should not anticipate the user's intentions rendering text in italics when the user instead wanted to start some block of text with an underscore for other purposes.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\nOften\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.15.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\nOS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_Markdown preview does not experience the same issue, because italics, to be rendered as such, expects a closing underline_\r\nThis is also GitHub behaviour as you can notice by the way is rendered here _search_form.html.erb.
