necessarily at the same time) without the hassle of clicking through the menus (right click > Add Project Folder > find my way to the folder...) but doing it from the CLI instead.\n\nThis comes with:\n- a single additional test, I'm not sure if adding more is necessary\n- documented CLI usage (automated)\n\nI'm not sure if that feature needs to be documented elsewhere, if it does I'd be happy to do it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10841/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":3,"confused":0,"heart":2}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10840","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10840/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10840/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10840/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10840","id":134023442,"number":10840,"title":"Flaky

v361.28.  \n\nEver since Atom 1.2.0, I have been experiencing these graphical issues as shown above and it happens all over the window, not just in the text editor.  I have tried compiling Atom from source, but it has the same issues.  I suspect it might have something to do with the version of Webkit Atom is using because I noticed Spotify 1.0.19 has the same kind of graphical glitches.\n\nAtom 1.1.0 is the latest version I can run without these issues occurring.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10828","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10828/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10828/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10828/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10828","id":133831105,"number":10828,"title":"Fix another TextEditorPresenter spec race","user":{"login":"joshaber","id":13760,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/13760?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber","html_url":"https://github.com/joshaber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-02-15T22:19:57Z","updated_at":"2016-02-16T01:32:48Z","closed_at":"2016-02-16T01:32:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/10828","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10828","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10828.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10828.patch"},"body":"Add the decoration after subscribing to state updates.
