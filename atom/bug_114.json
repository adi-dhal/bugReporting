Within Windows, I have mapped a network drive to the VM webroot folder, which contains my projects. I use Atom to directly edit files on this mapped drive, which generally works well.\n\nThis setup does have incidental issues, which I would like to share. \n\nFirst, if I shut down my VM whilst having Atom open, it freezes. Somewhat understandable, since the mapped drive is unmounted and Atom can no longer find the files, but it would be nicer to have a clean exit or detection of this state, instead of just hanging forever.\n\nSecond, if I then start up the VM again and confirm in Windows explorer that the files are accessible again, if I then start up Atom, it again hangs forever. Only a Windows reboot seems to solve that.\n\nI know that this bug will be hard to reproduce as it requires a very specific setup, but I want to share it anyway. Atom is by far my favorite editor feature-wise, but due to so many random freezes where I have no idea what it is doing, I keep switching back to editors that just work. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12420","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12420/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12420/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12420/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12420","id":171071505,"number":12420,"title":"Removing file from stage with git breaks Atom git-integration","user":{"login":"Algram","id":5053729,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5053729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Algram","html_url":"https://github.com/Algram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Algram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Algram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Algram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Algram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Algram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Algram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Algram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Algram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Algram/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-08-14T18:25:16Z","updated_at":"2016-08-15T16:16:32Z","closed_at":"2016-08-15T16:16:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\n\nIf you use `git reset HEAD <filename>` to remove a file from staging that has been modified in Atom the git information highlighting stops working.

Application.\n\n**Actual behavior:** Atom opens a blank (empty) editor, without any documents open (I have \"Open blank editor on startup\" set to false)\n### Versions\n\n```\n$ atom --version\nAtom

Prerequisites\n- [ ] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n\nNot entirely sure about this.\n- [ ] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n\nYes. I have \"install new updates on restart\" enabled.\n- [ ] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n\nI asked on Slack (atomio.slack.com) and one user mentioned how I should definitely file an issue for this. I've never seen or heard any application delete all packages and user settings based on application close. \n- [ ] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n\nJust performed cursory search, no issues like this open. \n- [ ] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n\nThis happened to the Atom editor. \n- [ ] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n\nJust did, this was not a crash (closed properly), but when it restarted all the packages were missing.\n\nFor more information on how to write a good [bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) or [enhancement request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\nAtom deleted all of my packages and themes upon application restart. Not really sure how else to elaborate on this, but pretty much reverted to base install (maybe more basic as file explorer is not present on left-hand-side as well).  \n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Have a lot of tabs open (I had my React project open at the time and had my README.md, and many Javascript files)\n2. Notable installed packages include those needed to run .eslintrc file (eslint-plugin-{react, lodash, etc.}, eslint)\n3. Delete tabs by using shortcut Cmd + W really fast\n4.

This is accompanied by a core dump which includes\n\n```\nCore was generated by `/usr/lib/electron/electron --type=renderer --js-flags='.\nProgram terminated with signal SIGILL, Illegal instruction.\n```\n\n(I can paste the whole core dump if wanted)\n\nThis is a fresh install of Arch Linux, I've installed the `base` and `gnome` groups, plus `grub`, `vivaldi`, `vlc`, `atom`, `go`, and `git`.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Install Arch Linux\n2. `sudo pacman -S atom` (Install atom from the repos)\n3.

Instead of relying on Grunt, we do everything via functions defined in the `script/lib` directory.\n### Build script\n\nThe _basic_ structure of the new build script is as follows:\n- Copy all sources to `atom/out/app`\n- Transpile Babel, CoffeeScript, and Less files in place\n- Generate pre-cached metadata\n- At this point, `out/app` is a valid Electron app that doesn't require transpilation support to run.\n- Run [`electron-packager`](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager) on `out/app` to package it into a distributable application on the current platform.\n- Build installer on Windows, code sign on macOS\n- Zip stuff up\n\nThis is all designed to run only on third-party build providers (CircleCI for macOS, Travis for Linux, and AppVeyor on Windows). We've put zero effort into making these scripts run on internal Janky boxes.\n### Release publishing plan\n\nWe deliberately omit the artifact uploading step, because our plan is to orchestrate release publishing outside of the build. We'll rely on the build services to store artifacts associated with all builds, and when we're ready to release we'll have a script download these artifacts from Circle, Travis, and AppVeyor and upload them to the releases API and S3. This will help to ensure that all artifacts stay in sync based on a specific commit SHA.\n### Tasks\n- [x] Build scripts working on all platforms\n  - [x] macOS\n    - [x] Build a complete electron app\n    - [x] Code sign\n    - [x] Green build on Circle\n    - [x] Implement `--install` flag\n  - [x] Windows\n    - [x] Build a complete electron app\n    - [x] Build an installer\n    - [x] Delete unnecessary .nupkg delta file uploaded as artifact\n    - [x] Code sign\n    - [x] Green build on AppVeyor\n    - [x] Installing won't be supported, because users can launch the generated installer.\n  - [x] Linux\n    - [x] Build a complete electron app \n    - [x] Generate `.deb` package\n    - [x] Generate `.rpm` package\n    - [x] Green build on Travis\n    - [x] Make Travis artifacts downloadable\n    - [x] Installing won't be supported, because users can launch the package manager on the generated packages.\n- [x] Add `script/lint`\n- [x] Release publishing\n  - [x] Visualize build status for release branch across all platforms\n  - [x] Download and publish artifacts for a specific SHA\n  - [x] Authenticate Atom maintainers that work for GitHub\n  - [x] Get app running on Heroku Enterprise\n  - [x] A pinch of styling\n- [x] Documentation\n  - [x] Rewrite build instructions for macOS\n  - [x] Rewrite build instructions for Windows\n  - [x] Rewrite build instructions for Linux\n- [x] Ops\n  - [x] Make builds a no-op on previous internal build systems.\n  - [x] Eliminate atom-private AppVeyor build and use private env vars instead\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12410/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":4,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12409","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12409/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12409/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12409/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12409","id":170962187,"number":12409,"title":"Mock clock and animation frames in TextEditorComponent specs","user":{"login":"nathansobo","id":1789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo","html_url":"https://github.com/nathansobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-08-12T21:25:16Z","updated_at":"2016-08-12T22:35:05Z","closed_at":"2016-08-12T22:35:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/12409","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12409","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12409.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12409.patch"},"body":"A few months ago, I rewrote the editor tests to use real timers and animation frames to address coverage gaps in the existing tests.

But I noticed in `v1.9.8` and some older versions that when I open an already existing large `*.sql` file, Atom doesn't highlight the code. I tried it in safe mode but still got the same issue even when I switched syntax themes.\r\n\r\nAtom only highlights large SQL code when I create a new untitled file and set the type to SQL and paste or type SQL code into it.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:** Atom highlights all the code in my SQL file.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior:** No highlights for the SQL code at all in a file except when in an untitled file.\r\n\r\nSome help would be appreciated. Thanks   \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12402","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12402/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12402/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12402/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12402","id":170793110,"number":12402,"title":"Atom crashed when open a folder","user":{"login":"nguyenbathanh","id":4046112,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4046112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguyenbathanh","html_url":"https://github.com/nguyenbathanh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguyenbathanh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguyenbathanh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguyenbathanh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguyenbathanh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguyenbathanh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguyenbathanh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguyenbathanh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguyenbathanh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguyenbathanh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":153145129,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/crash","name":"crash","color":"e11d21","default":false},{"id":62363277,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-08-12T03:36:27Z","updated_at":"2016-11-01T08:28:07Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\n\nAtom crashed when open a folder.
