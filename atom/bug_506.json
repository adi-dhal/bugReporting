in multiple paragraphs from a Word document I had opened in Pages gave me a weird line ending/highlighting glitch:\n![screen shot 2013-05-20 at 3 26 27

text pasted was:\n\n```\nAssessment:  Friendly discussion with local contacts to assess whether the subject has information of value and to identify any personal attitudes, beliefs, problems or needs that could be exploitable. \n\nElicitation:   A ploy whereby seemingly normal conversation is contrived to extract intelligence information of value.  Advantages of this technique are: (1) Puts someone at ease to share information, (2) Difficult to recognize as an intelligence technique, and (3) Easily deniable. \n\nEavesdropping:  Listening to other people’s conversations to gather information. Frequently employed in social environments where attendees feel comfortable, secure and, therefore, more likely to talk about themselves or their work. Frequent venues include restaurants, bars, and public transportation. Eavesdropping can occur in a radius of six to eight seats on public transportation or ten to twelve feet in other settings. \n\nTechnical Eavesdropping:  Use of audio and visual devices, usually concealed.  This technique is relatively cost efficient and low risk.  Concealed devices can be installed in public and private facilities, such as hotel rooms, restaurants, offices, and automobiles. \n\nBag Operations:  Surreptitious entry into the subject’s hotel room to steal, photograph, or photocopy documents; steal or copy magnetic media; or download files from laptop computers.  Often conducted or condoned by host government intelligence, security services, or operatives for local corporations.  Frequently done with cooperation of hotel staff. \n\nSurveillance:  An act of following the subject to determine contacts and activities.  This method is labor intensive, if done correctly, and not usually employed unless suspected of improper activity or a target of great interest. \n\nTheft of Information:  Stealing of documents, briefcases, laptop computers or sensitive equipment.  Laptop computers are especially vulnerable as they may contain key information.  Foreign service has plausible denial since the laptop may have been stolen for the value of the laptop rather than the value of information.  This makes it difficult to determine if the information was compromised or not. \n\nIntercepting Electronic Communications:  Method of electronically monitoring telephones, facsimiles, and computers.  Subject is particularly vulnerable while communicating to, from or within foreign countries, as most foreign telecommunications systems cooperate with their country’s security service.  Office, hotel, and portable telephones (including cellular) are key targets. \n```\n\nConsole:\n\nLoad time: 710

bug affects version 9.0\n\nI often try to match puppet module files with the fuzzy finder. These files are located on disk here:\n\n```\nmodules/foo/manifests/bar.pp\n```\n\nThey're referred to in code as classes like this:\n\n```\nfoo::bar\n```\n\nSo my use case here is typing `foo/bar.pp` into the finder and attempting to match on the basename.\n\nFor example, typing `github/god.pp` into the Finder used to bring up `modules/github/manifests/god.pp` as the first hit. Now it seems to prefer\n`modules/god/manifests/init.pp`.\n\n![image](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/47/512536/da854d58-be2a-11e2-840f-3e7daf9f8fff.png)\n\n@probablycorey says:\n\n> that's a bug.

Now, we also return `ImageEditSession`s if you're opening a path that ends with an image file extension. In my rework of @mutle's terminal package, I want to be able to call `rootView.open(\"terminal://~\")` to open a terminal with `~` as its working directory using the same mechanism that I use to open anything else. This makes it possible:\n\nTo register a custom opener, call `Project.registerOpener(fn)` with a function that takes a `uri`a and an optional `options` hash as parameters. Whenever anything is opened, the project will attempt all openers in the order they are registered. If your function returns a resource, it will short-circuit the opening process and `Project.open` will return it.\n\nYou can also call `Project.unregisterOpener(fn)` with the same function to unregister it, which you should do upon deactivation of your package.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/551","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/551/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/551/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/551/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/551","id":14293808,"number":551,"title":"Would

time ago, @kevinsawicki and I discovered that the entire screen was repainting whenever the cursor moved. We tracked the issue down to updating the cursor position text in the status bar, which was combining with the legacy flexbox implementation to cause the entire screen to relayout and repaint. When we upgraded to the new flexbox spec implementation, the issue went away. We concluded that the newer flexbox code must have been smart enough to know that the rest of the elements hadn't changed and didn't need to be repainted. At some point since then, the situation has regressed.\n\nWith the show-repaint-rects option enabled in the dev tools, here's what it looks like to move the cursor without the status bar enabled:\n\n![screen shot 2013-05-10 at 3 15 17 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1789/490314/f8df3c0a-b9b6-11e2-8f85-c3b4386fe826.png)\n\nNote the multiple colored outlines around various lines. These indicate that the lines are being repainted two-at-a-time due to the line-highlight class being added and removed. This is the repaint you would expect and is extremely low-overhead.\n\nNow with the status bar enabled:\n\n![screen shot 2013-05-10 at 3 14 58 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1789/490324/26f744fc-b9b7-11e2-8cf5-f3cbf55dc633.png)\n\nNote that now there is _only_ a colored outline around the entire window, indicating that everything has been redrawn. This takes way longer and hurts performance a lot.\n\nI checked out the commit in which Kevin and I made the change, just to make sure I'm not crazy. I had some other issues getting anything but an untitled buffer to load, but the repainting works properly with the status bar enabled:\n\n![screen shot 2013-05-10 at 3 36 19 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1789/490390/d1fffa40-b9b9-11e2-8dbc-3c0e8d3f2ecf.png)\n\nI'm not exactly sure when this went bad. It's expensive to bisect because of the various versions of cef and cefode I would need to download. My theory is that something changed in webkit to make it slow again.\n\nPerhaps this will change again when we switch to a newer version of Chromium with atom-shell. If not, @zcbenz, do you think this is something you could investigate in the Chromium source code? It would be great to understand if there's an approach we can take to limit repaint or if there's an optimization that could be added to webkit to avoid the issue. If anyone on our team can figure it out, it's you.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/546/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/545","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/545/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/545/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/545/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/545","id":14202079,"number":545,"title":"Config

When pasting that text, we use that data to increase or decrease the indentation level of the pasted text.\n\nAll three of these will be editor config settings, previously they were coupled

found a way to make mapping performance O(fold-count + wrapped-line-count + 1) instead of O(line-count). For all conceivable cases, the number of folds and wrapped lines will be vastly smaller than the number of lines in the buffer, so this is a big win in performance with extremely large files. We can still use a variant of a skip list to make it O(ln(fold-count + wrapped-line-count)), but this puts off the need to do that since it will only become an issue with huge numbers of folds.\n\nThe basic idea is to build a row map that supports the ability to map a buffer or screen row range to a smaller number of rows in the other coordinate system. So a fold of rows 5-10 would look like this (note that the end row is exclusive... it's simpler that way).\n\n``` coffeescript\nrowMap.mapBufferRowRange(5, 11, 1)\n```\n\nThat says that we intend to represent buffer rows 5-11 (end-exclusive) as a single row on screen.\n\nTo express a wrapped line, we do the reverse, passing a screen row count (3rd argument) that is larger than the number of buffer rows spanned by the first two arguments:\n\n``` coffeescript\nrowMap.mapBufferRowRange(2, 3, 2)\n```\n\nThat says that rows 2 and 3 on screen actually represent the same row in the buffer, which is what happens when a single buffer line wraps to multiple lines on screen.\n\nAnd finally, to fold some buffer lines _completely_ away, making them invisible, we'd store tho following mapping:\n\n``` coffeescript\nrowMap.mapBufferRowRange(5, 11, 0)\n```\n### To Do\n- [x] Merge adjacent isomorphic regions in the RowMap\n- [x] Delete LineMap\n- [x] Refactor `DisplayBuffer.updateScreenLines` into a few methods. It's too long.\n- [x] Simplify ScreenLine and possibly rename to

`rake clean && rake install` to get it back to a usable state. Nothing worked!\n\nAfter a while, I opened up the dev tools and realized the DOM was populated. That's when I hit the keycombo for the tree view, and voila--of course everything was there.\n\nBased on this I would just suggest that, when opening a folder that didn't have any files open from the last session, the tree view should be default on. Of course, if you did have files open from the last session, they're reopened automatically, so that makes sense.
