OS X there's a separate pasteboard, NSFindPboard, used to keep search fields in sync.  The pasteboard gets updated when a search field changes or the user hits ⌘-E with text selected.  It can be pretty handy when you're searching through code for the same keyword, and most apps seem to generally respect it (Safari/XCode/Chrome/etc).  In general it seems like apps check it when they become active and update their search fields.\n\nChromium definitely supports NSFindPboard ([with some of the impl here](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/git-svn/ui/base/cocoa/find_pasteboard.mm)), but I'm not sure that stuff is accessible at all from the Javascript layer.  \n\nOne option is just to shell out to pbpaste/pbcopy to get/update the pboard's contents, as in:\n\n```\n pbpaste -pboard find\n```\n\nwill dump the contents of NSFindPboard to stdout.\n\nYou could also technically get at it with NodeObjC, but that seems like overkill.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4650/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4649","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4649/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4649/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4649/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4649","id":52171189,"number":4649,"title":"Uncaught

seems that the clipboard support in linux is broken\nFor example, I can not paste after deleting a character or to be more precise the deleted caracter is pasted.\nIt seems that internaly Atom uses a selection to select the character to delete and this updates the clipboard\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1) type foo on a new editor window\n2) select the text using the mouse or keybord\n3) press ctrl + c\n4) go to the end of line\n5) hit backspace 1 time to delete the last O\n6) press ctrl + v\n\nI should get fofoo instead I get foo\n\nI'm using fedora 20 and atom
