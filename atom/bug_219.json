I've had to restart Atom more frequently, leading me to ask \"why now?\"\n\nWhen I run a heap dump, the events object seems to just grow and grow, suggesting a leak. I haven't been able to test extensively, but a quick inspection of the events object suggests the text snippet is stored in memory, but never seems to be released. I would expect a cut operation to copy the snippet, but when I cut another snippet of text, I would expect the content of the original cut to be released from memory.\n\nMy tests have been pretty unscientific, but suggestive. I am cutting/pasting an average of 40-50 lines of code at a time. When I cut several larger snippets in reasonably quick succession, say 400 lines of code, memory consumption appears to increase more rapidly (and remain high).\n\nI've disabled every 3rd party plugin and several core plugins. Copy/paste appears to work decently... so I've been able to work around things by copying code and deleting it, then pasting it. It's an annoying way to work though a refactor though.\n\nI've also noticed the Atom helper typically reaching 1.9GB according to the activity monitor, but my overall RAM consumption hits 31.2 GB (of 32GB). As soon as I kill the process, it drops to 20GB total consumption.\n\nAll of this was primarily experienced on OSX (Mavericks & El Capitan) with an i5 CPU and 32GB of RAM. I've also experienced these issues on my Windows 8.1 laptop (i7 with 12GB RAM) with no change after upgrading to Win 10.\n\nFinally, I do a fair amount of work with Electron and do not see memory issues like this in many of my apps, albeit my text editors are substantially less complex than Atom. I bring this up only because this (to me) suggests an issue with the Atom app, not the underlying Electron platform. \n\nI hope this helps in some way.

After using Atom on such a second screen lately I found the editor to restore its window position without a second screen available today, i.e. it moved itself out of the visible area on start.\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\nBefore restoring its old position, Atom checks whether that position would place it outside the current visible area (defined by all installed screend and their resolution). If so, it just moves to some default position (e.g. `(0; 0)`).\n\n**Workaround:**\nThere might be some easy tricks, but I was just lucky to have a program I regularly use to easily order my windows and that tool is able to move the window back into the visible area. Those who are not having such a tool may find [this solution from superuser.com](http://superuser.com/a/53590) useful (but as this issue hasn't been posted yet I assume as a regular screen-configuration-changer I'm part of a minority).\n\nI don't see this as a major/important issue, but I wanted to report it for the sake of integrity. **If you're able to, please try to reproduce this. It may also just be an issue on my side.**\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9223/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9222","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9222/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9222/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9222/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9222","id":112297589,"number":9222,"title":"Reintroduce ::getMaxScrollTop","user":{"login":"as-cii","id":482957,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/482957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii","html_url":"https://github.com/as-cii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-10-20T06:38:44Z","updated_at":"2015-10-20T15:44:05Z","closed_at":"2015-10-20T15:44:03Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/9222","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9222","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9222.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9222.patch"},"body":"Refs: https://github.com/atom-minimap/minimap/issues/299\n\n/cc: @nathansobo @abe33 \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9221","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9221/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9221/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9221/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9221","id":112288279,"number":9221,"title":"Settings -> packages only shows a subset of installed packages","user":{"login":"halhenke","id":1448377,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1448377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/halhenke","html_url":"https://github.com/halhenke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/halhenke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/halhenke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/halhenke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/halhenke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/halhenke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/halhenke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/halhenke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/halhenke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/halhenke/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true},{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-10-20T05:10:30Z","updated_at":"2015-10-20T14:25:00Z","closed_at":"2015-10-20T14:24:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"e.g. If I do `apm list` in the console I can see that the `atom-ctags` package is installed. \n\nHowever, inside Atom -
