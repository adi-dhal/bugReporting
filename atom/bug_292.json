I've spent sometime finding a possible solution.\n1. Instead of having a binary in the Atom.app/Contents/MacOS use your script Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/atom.sh.\n2. The script needs 2 changes:\n   - change for the new location of the binary\n   - change the first line of the script from:\n     #!/usr/bin/env bash\n     to:\n     #!/usr/bin/env bash -l\n\nThis seems to start Atom from a bash shell that runs the ~/.profile script first allowing all of the environment variables to get set and made visible to Atom.\n\nOS X still does not have shared global environment variables. But it does help establish the login environment variables for atom including PATH.\n\nI've made a new application just for your script as my current work around.\n\nThanks,\nMark

I've just noticed a somewhat strange glitch in how Atom responds to <kbd>Tab</kbd> in certain scopes---in particular Markdown, but I haven't cycled through them all yet. Setting the tab length to four spaces, either in `.gfm.source` or globally, causes Atom to insert four spaces but visually snap the cursor back to the middle of the tabstop, roughly two spaces in. From there, typing causes the cursor to jump back and insert text at the expected position about half of the time, and about half the time to drop text right where it appears to be, with two spaces before the insertion and two spaces trailing it. This also happens when I type four spaces the old-fashioned way.\n\nI dropped a quick screencast demonstrating the hiccup at https://cloudup.com/cUq4wn72BsS. It was recorded with a brand-new, untampered-with Atom setup: I reinstalled the binary to be safe, and moved my `~/.atom` folder out of `$HOME`. The same behavior occurred, both without any third-party packages present and in safe mode.\n\nSo far I can attest that this _doesn't_ happen in plain-text mode, in Python, or with the scopes created by the `language-latex` package, but I can't generalize beyond that yet.\n\nPlease let me know if I can provide any more or any better information about the problem! And thanks in advance for your help.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7030/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7029","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7029/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7029/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7029/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7029","id":82857253,"number":7029,"title":"Atom is being treated as malware by antivirus programs on Windows.","user":{"login":"vkbansal","id":5930351,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5930351?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkbansal","html_url":"https://github.com/vkbansal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkbansal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkbansal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkbansal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkbansal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkbansal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkbansal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkbansal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkbansal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkbansal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-05-30T16:43:38Z","updated_at":"2015-05-30T17:22:39Z","closed_at":"2015-05-30T17:22:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I had this issue on several machines running Windows 8.1 x64. `atom.exe` is flagged due to suspicious activities.\n\nThe antivirus programs tried:\n- Avast\n- Bitdefender\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7029/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7028","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7028/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7028/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7028/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7028","id":82826184,"number":7028,"title":"Uncaught Error: Encountered an invalid scope end id.

See atom/text-buffer#66.\n\nThis is one of several optimizations aimed at addressing Atom's slowness when an editor has a lot  of markers (e.g. find-and-replace results, spell-check highlights).\n#### Problem\n\nCurrently, each decorated marker in the editor is individually observed by the `TextEditorPresenter` using `Marker::onDidChange`. Even though the presenter doesn't do much work for markers that are off-screen, just emitting all these change events becomes expensive when there are 10,000+ markers. The main cost is computing each marker's screen coordinates based on the underlying buffer coordinates.\n\nThis is a flame graph taken while inserting a newline into a file 2800 line file with 17000 search results. It took **1.5 seconds**. The region between the red arrows is emitting marker change events.\n\n![screen shot 2015-06-04 at 10 50 45 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/326587/7990786/27838374-0aa8-11e5-8c6e-e64d0377c29a.png)\n#### Solution\n\n~~We've added a new API on `TextEditor` called `::observeMarkers()`, which allows you to observe any marker changes within a particular region of the editor.~~ The presenter now simply recomputes decoration states whenever any markers update. It determines that markers have updated using the text-buffer's `::onDidUpdateMarkers` method. This means that most markers are not observed, so they can avoid observing changes to their underlying `text-buffer` marker, preventing unnecessary screen-coordinate translations.\n\nThe same operation as performed above now takes **170 ms**. Still not fast, but we've removed a bottleneck.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7022","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7022/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7022/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7022/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/7022","id":82610930,"number":7022,"title":"Introduce
