Over the course of the beta a few have been solved but one remains, and it has an ugly cousin.\n\nThe simple point is that when making a selection, if the cursor (which still held down in  a drag) crosses over the gutter between the line numbers and the editor area itself Atom seems to take this as 'the cursor is at the end of the line'. If you move the mouse beyond this gutter into the actual line numbers, we're back to normal.\n\nThe ugly cousin is that if the line being selected is longer than the editor window (and there's no wrapping), thus selecting the end of the line would cause the editor to scroll, there's a nice back-and-forth game it likes to play.\n\nI am currently unable to upload a gif, but see [my original post](http://discuss.atom.io/t/gutter-selection-bug/8719) for now if you want to see both of these in action.\n\nUpdate:
