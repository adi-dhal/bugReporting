Meaning that it will no longer know what the file's type is and it reloads the file. The biggest issue with this is that it will unfold all lines of code. which is a problem if you use function folding as an organizational method.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open a file. The most obvious moments of this issue are with JavaScript files that are large, more than 3000 lines of code. However, this happens no matter what the type of the file is and also no matter its size.\n2. Fold a few functions or blocks of code, and then make a change somewhere in the file.\n3. Save the file and notice the immediate repaint where all blocks of folded code are unfolded and there is a slight moment where all syntax coloring is removed from the open file.\n\n**Expected behavior:** In previous versions of Atom, there wasn't a repaint and all folded blocks of code remained folded.\n\n**Actual behavior:** Please see description.\n### Versions\n\nAtom: 1.11.2\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome: 49.0.2623.75\nNode: 5.10.0\n\nAPM: 1.12.5\nNPM: 3.10.5\nNode: 4.4.5\nPython: 2.7.10\nGit: 2.8.1\n\nmacOS: 10.12\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13060","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13060/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13060/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13060/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13060","id":184832450,"number":13060,"title":"Atom plugins ignore sound device select (Gnome)","user":{"login":"Enelar","id":750396,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/750396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Enelar","html_url":"https://github.com/Enelar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Enelar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Enelar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Enelar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Enelar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Enelar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Enelar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Enelar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Enelar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Enelar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-10-24T12:54:58Z","updated_at":"2016-10-24T13:03:41Z","closed_at":"2016-10-24T13:03:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [Y] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n- [Y] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [Y] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [N] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [IDK] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [Y] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n\nFor more information on how to write a good [bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) or [enhancement request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\nOn Gnome Desktop, system notifications always using default sound device. You can alter that behaviour, but from the box, they ignore headset presence. Which is for most cases acceptable.\n\nBut somehow, Atom (Or maybe electron itself?) using such channel too. Which making plugins like audio player / youtube window / chrome plus ignore headset.\n\n**I am asking maintainer to prove**, that this is not issue of Atom itself, before i will flag this case to Electron/Gnome/PulseAudio community.

Am considering making this happen automatically when you first run Atom with no existing project history state file.\n- Multiple folder projects appear in the menu as the last name in the paths separated by a comma e.g. 'atom, settings-view' for width. They appear in full in the pop-up palette.\n- Reopening a project always appears in a new window as window-state is preserved between projects and it is quite jarring otherwise.\n- 'Clear Project History' appears at the top of the menu instead of ideally at the bottom due to limitations of the MenuManager and how it handles separators. Will be addressed in the future once that is resolved.\n- Setting `core.reopenProjectMenuCount` does not disable the menu right now because of the same limitations as above (removing at run-time refuses to remove the separator)\n## Screenshots\n### Reopen Project menu\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/118951/19613861/4e6ea51a-97a4-11e6-8d45-606e712e2e99.png)\n### Reopen Project command list picker\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/118951/19613853/3cc98fbe-97a4-11e6-9c89-3a285318d322.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13046/reactions","total_count":12,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":12,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13045","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13045/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13045/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13045/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13045","id":184531767,"number":13045,"title":"1.5 releases","user":{"login":"thaisdemoura","id":20845365,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/20845365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaisdemoura","html_url":"https://github.com/thaisdemoura","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaisdemoura/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaisdemoura/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaisdemoura/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaisdemoura/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaisdemoura/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaisdemoura/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaisdemoura/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaisdemoura/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaisdemoura/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722939,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"e6e6e6","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-10-21T17:07:00Z","updated_at":"2017-08-21T13:30:55Z","closed_at":"2016-10-21T17:34:00Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/13045","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13045","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13045.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13045.patch"},"body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13044","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13044/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13044/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13044/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13044","id":184474573,"number":13044,"title":"500 code on package installation","user":{"login":"setni","id":6566026,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6566026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/setni","html_url":"https://github.com/setni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setni/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-10-21T12:33:54Z","updated_at":"2017-08-23T15:30:20Z","closed_at":"2016-10-21T13:55:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\n\n500 code on package installation\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.

Also note that in Notepad++, this is part of the core, so this is not necessarily about a \"package\"; or to state it more accurately, this is not necessarily about a non-core package - although I don't propose by any means for it to be the only official form of project management either.\n\nOne great feature this project manager might have, is to create a project from a git or hg repository.  After all, one is not forced to add directories in Git or Hg; and when one does, and then add new files, they are not automatically part of the repository.  Why shouldn't a text editor have a project manager work that way?  I am keen to get Atom started on this early on.  Netbeans is a mature text editor, and does not have this; but it is not uncommon either.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13039","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13039/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13039/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13039/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13039","id":184371708,"number":13039,"title":"Adding < as a wrappable token?","user":{"login":"zyklus","id":320562,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/320562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyklus","html_url":"https://github.com/zyklus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyklus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyklus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyklus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyklus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyklus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyklus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyklus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyklus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zyklus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-10-21T00:18:23Z","updated_at":"2016-10-21T00:23:13Z","closed_at":"2016-10-21T00:23:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Is there a way to add `<` as a wrappable token?

selection feature (really nice :smile:). However I do have some painpoints related to how the selection stops.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Write this on an empty editor.\n\n```\nthis is   an example\nthis_is_an_example\nTHIS_IS_AN_EXAMPLE\nTHIS_is_anExample\nthis_is   an_example\nthisIsAnExample\nthis__is___an__example\n```\n1. Position your cursor on the beginning of the file and execute `editor:select-to-end-of-word` 4 times, take note of the behavior.\n2. Position your cursor back to the beginning of the file.\n3. Execute `editor:select-to-next-subword-boundary` 4 times.\n4. If there are more lines, go to the beginning of the next line and go to step 4 until all lines are processed.\n\n**Expected behavior:**\nEvery line had the same behavior on step 4 compared to what happened on step 2.\n\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\nOn step 4...\n- :x:  Line 1 stopped at spaces which is ok, but the next execution should select the spaces plus the next word.\n- :white_check_mark: Line 2 behaved just as expected. \n- :x: Line 3 behaved like line 1 but with underscores instead of spaces.\n- :x: Line 4 just like line 1 did the same on the first underscore, but not on the second one.\n     It did stop at the \"camel case\".\n- :x: Line 5 worked as expected selecting the underscores worked, but not the space.\n- :white_check_mark: Line 6 as expected.\n- :white_check_mark: Line 7 same.\n### Versions\n\nAtom    : 1.11.2\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\napm  1.12.5\nnpm  3.10.5\nnode 4.4.5\npython 2.7.6\ngit 1.9.1\nLinux
