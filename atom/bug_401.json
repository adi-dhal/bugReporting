While our current decorations API eliminates the need to access the view layer in order to render highlights, view layer access is still required to implement custom overlays such as the autocomplete menu. Since we'll be pushing the editors internals into the shadow DOM, we need to provide a model-level alternative.\n\nA natural way to do this is to extend the current decoration API with a new kind of decoration in addition to highlights, an _overlay decoration_. Like the pane item and panel APIs, package authors should be able to associate a view model or view with a marker and have it render in the editor in the right place. Here's how I envision the it looking:\n\n``` coffee\ndecoration = textEditor.decorateMarker marker,\n  type: 'overlay'\n  item: new AutocompleteMenu\n```\n\nJust like for pane and panel items, you'll be able to employ the workspace's view provider system to teach Atom how to render views for item models:\n\n``` coffee\natom.workspace.addViewProvider\n  modelConstructor: AutocompleteMenu\n  viewConstructor: AutocompleteMenuElement\n```\n\nThis means you can use `atom.workspace.getView()` to retrieve the view for an overlay decoration's item.\n\n``` coffee\natom.workspace.getView(decoration.getItem()) # ==> get corresponding view\n```\n\nIf your overlay is simple enough to implement without a model, you can also add a view directly as an item rather than using the view provider system for sake of convenience.\n\n``` coffee\nelement = new AutocompleteMenuElement\nelement.setModel(new AutocompleteMenu)\n\ndecoration = textEditor.decorateMarker marker,\n  type: 'overlay'\n  item: element\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3746","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3746/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3746/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3746/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/3746","id":45148862,"number":3746,"title":"Use custom tag names in core","user":{"login":"nathansobo","id":1789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo","html_url":"https://github.com/nathansobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"nathansobo","id":1789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo","html_url":"https://github.com/nathansobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"assignees":[{"login":"nathansobo","id":1789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo","html_url":"https://github.com/nathansobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-10-07T19:12:10Z","updated_at":"2014-10-09T14:58:55Z","closed_at":"2014-10-09T14:58:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/3746","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/3746","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/3746.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/3746.patch"},"body":"I was previously considering this part of the shadow DOM roadmap item, but I think it makes sense to be a bit more granular.

My initial thought was that Atom does not support HTML autocompletes and I was very disappointed. But I could not believe Atom missed such a basic functionality. So I digged deeper. I found that atom has HTML _snippets_ which can be used by writing `ta` and pressing `tab` key to use the `table` snippet.\n\nThis behavior is very counter intuitive.

feature spans several package/repo (apm, settings-view, atom), so I'll put it there as reference. \n### Use Case\n\nI created a package on Atom version X and relied on some API that was broken on version Y. If I fix the package to use the new API, people that still use version X will be notified of the update and will end up with errors due to the new API not being available in their current version. \nOne solution packages-side would be to detect which API is available and switch between implementation. But as you can guess, this is far from ideal as it puts a lots of constraints in maintaining such a package.\n### A Simple Solution\n\nAtom is already assuming that every package must define an `engine` field with an Atom semver string as value. A simple solution would be to test this version against the current Atom version. \nThis test could be done at several moments: \n- When loading a package in Atom, for instance, a package sets its engine version to `<= 0.123`, if Atom version is `0.124` the package is not loaded and reported as an incompatible package.\n- When installing a package with `apm install <package>`. If the package engine version doesn't match the current Atom version, the install is cancelled and reported to the user with the adhoc message (package X expects version Y of Atom).\n- When searching/installing/updating a package from the settings view, the package block could display mention of the expected engine version, and the install/update button should be disabled if the versions doesn't match.\n\nThat way, people with legacy versions of Atom won't see errors poping up due to a package update relying on new API not available in their version while, at the same time, providing them with information about the incompatibility\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3740","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3740/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3740/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3740/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/3740","id":45067880,"number":3740,"title":"Disable folding if isFoldEnabled config is false.","user":{"login":"russlescai","id":331502,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/331502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/russlescai","html_url":"https://github.com/russlescai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/russlescai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/russlescai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/russlescai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/russlescai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/russlescai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/russlescai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/russlescai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/russlescai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/russlescai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2014-10-07T05:03:23Z","updated_at":"2014-10-07T23:36:53Z","closed_at":"2014-10-07T23:36:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/3740","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/3740","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/3740.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/3740.patch"},"body":"Allows the disabling of Code Folding.
