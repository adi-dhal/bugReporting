This is a screenshot before gutter tiling:\n\n![before](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/7990205/ac41dbdc-0aef-11e5-9f20-c6708f5268f6.png)\n\nAnd this is after:\n\n![after](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/7990208/b02f2006-0aef-11e5-99bb-c74e6f7e08ee.png)\n\n_To see the difference, please have a look at them at full-screen. Benchmarks were performed using the following script on `text-editor-component-spec.coffee`:_\n\n``` coffee\nstartBenchmark: (time=10, delta=250) ->\n  @benchmarkInterval = setInterval(->\n    document.querySelector(\"html /deep/ .editor-contents--private\").dispatchEvent(new WheelEvent(\"mousewheel\", wheelDeltaY: -delta))\n  , time)\n```\n\nChrome further confirms we have a ~50% speedup on paint times:\n\n| Before | After |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![screen shot 2015-06-04 at 19 29 37](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/7990247/104574cc-0af0-11e5-94fe-7506187ee889.png) | ![screen shot 2015-06-04 at 19 29 31](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/7990246/1017763a-0af0-11e5-84a3-5e30f149c0bf.png) |\n\nA byproduct of this change is that we'll be able to paint more than ~750k lines! :tada: \n\nI took the chance to extract out a `TiledComponent` which aims to cleanly abstract away all the complexity of creating a tile on screen and moving it up and down. I think there is a similar duplication in `TextEditorPresenter` but I'd like to a wait a bit more before introducing an abstraction in there, too.\n### What's missing\n- [x] Find a better name for `TileComponent` (it clashes with `TiledComponent`). I think we should keep the latter and get rid of the former, e.g. `TileComponent -> LinesTileComponent`.\n- [x] Adjust existing specs to support this new behavior\n- [x] Spec coverage for tiling (having a reusable contract test for this one seems like a good path, as we can use it for every `TiledComponent`)\n- [x] Make sure custom gutters continue to work. @jssln: I think nothing huge should be screwed up with this PR (although changes like the one in `gutter-component-helpers.coffee` look suspicious), but you did a great job on the gutter and I'd :heart: to have your feedback :bow: \n- [x] Uncomment `if @newState.maxLineNumberDigits isnt @oldState.maxLineNumberDigits` and handle that scenario\n- [x] Refine `text-editor-presenter-spec.coffee`'s tests names\n\n/cc: @nathansobo
