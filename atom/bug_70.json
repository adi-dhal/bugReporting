Description of the Change\r\n\r\nCurrently atom creates two buffers for the same file if passed paths use difference case for disk drive letter, e.g. `d:\\file.txt` and `D:\\file.txt`\r\n\r\nThis change ensures that the absolute path always has disk drive letter in uppercase. \r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nThe other place where this fix could be applied is [findBufferForPath](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/project.coffee#L331) function. However the used function [resolvePath](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/project.coffee#L229) already has some path normalization code, so I think this is the best fit.\r\n\r\nActually Windows interpreters `file.txt` and `File.txt` as the same file. Maybe it makes sense to extend this patch and make Atom to do the same on this operation system, but I'm not sure because it can be file system specific. Any suggestions are welcome!\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nI believe the current behavior of the editor is wrong for Windows users, so it makes no sense to create a plugin to fix that.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nThe main benefit I would like to get is the ability to click on parsed backtrace in my terminal emulation app (ConEmu). Right now it works, but atom opens second buffer for the same file because it doesn't normalize disk drive letter.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nThe possible drawback is some broken tests, but I've checked that and it seems everything works.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nHere is the related issue #8221. It's not exactly about my problem, but it's very near.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13754/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13753","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13753/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13753/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13753/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13753","id":205627425,"number":13753,"title":":memo:

Install Centos7\r\n2. Install atom with the 1.13.0 rpm\r\n1. Install autocomplete-python package\r\n2. Close Atom\r\n3. Open Atom\r\n4. Open python file\r\n5. Start typing something that might trigger autocomplete\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nautocomplete dialogue appears, no warnings are thrown\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\nno dialogue appears the warning/error is thrown\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell this is an issue with the atom rpm install for fedora/centos.\r\n\r\nAfter running\r\n```\r\nrpm -Uvh atom.x84_64.rpm\r\n```\r\nI can now find 2 copies of the atom executable one at `/bin/atom` and one at `/usr/share/atom/atom`. I would typically expect one of those to be a symlink to the other but that is not the case here. The desktop icon that the rpm adds to Gnome is pointed at the executable `/usr/share/atom/atom `\r\n\r\nIf I run atom from the command line with `/usr/share/atom/atom` I get the following error\r\n```\r\nbash: cannot set terminal process group (-1): Inappropriate ioctl for device\r\nbash: no job control in this shell\r\n```\r\nand the `BASH_FUNC_module` error for autocomplete-python persists. So you obviously see this same behaviour with the desktop icon.\r\n\r\nIf I run atom with `/bin/atom` there are no errors and everything works as expected.\r\n\r\n### Current Solutions\r\n\r\nEither\r\n\r\n1. Run atom from the commandline allowing it to resolve to `/bin/atom`\r\n2. As I'm using gnome I changed the atom desktop icon to always call `/bin/atom` is called. I made the following edits to `/usr/share/applications/atom.desktop`\r\n```\r\nExec=/bin/atom %F\r\nIcon=/usr/share/atom/atom.png\r\n```\r\nand then log out and back in to Gnome","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13733/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13732","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13732/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13732/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13732/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13732","id":205041667,"number":13732,"title":"Uncaught Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, lstat '$ATOM_HOME/.learn-ide/home/chrissa1-450...","user":{"login":"t3mp3st19","id":25016040,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/25016040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3mp3st19","html_url":"https://github.com/t3mp3st19","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3mp3st19/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3mp3st19/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3mp3st19/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3mp3st19/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3mp3st19/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3mp3st19/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3mp3st19/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3mp3st19/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3mp3st19/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722939,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"e6e6e6","default":true},{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-02-03T00:45:15Z","updated_at":"2017-02-03T16:06:28Z","closed_at":"2017-02-03T16:06:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[Enter steps to reproduce below:]\r\n\r\n1.

Open a project in terminal with `atom .`\r\n2. Open a file and modify it, don't save.\r\n3. Close Atom(this won't repro if there's other atom windows open.  Only if all Atom instances are closed)\r\n4. On the same directory in terminal, do `atom <new file name>`\r\n\r\n\r\n**Actual**: Atom opens new file with the current folder.  The changes on the file that was modify in step 2 are gone.  When you close Atom and reopen with `atom .` or opening recent projects, it shows the new file from step 4 only.\r\n\r\n**Expected**: old tabs and unsaved changes should exist(if there are any) and new file should open in new tab \r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100% if you don't have another atom instance open, If you do, the new file will be opened there.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\natom --version\r\nAtom    : 1.13.1\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\napm --version\r\napm  1.14.1\r\nnpm  3.10.5\r\nnode 4.4.5\r\npython 2.7.10\r\ngit 2.10.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis issue was found while testing https://github.com/atom/tabs/issues/306#issuecomment-276861137","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13729/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13728","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13728/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13728/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13728/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13728","id":204965330,"number":13728,"title":"Atom v1.12.0 breaks hotkeys.","user":{"login":"notiv-nt","id":10743009,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10743009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/notiv-nt","html_url":"https://github.com/notiv-nt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notiv-nt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notiv-nt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notiv-nt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notiv-nt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notiv-nt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notiv-nt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notiv-nt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notiv-nt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notiv-nt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-02-02T19:03:22Z","updated_at":"2017-02-05T20:29:06Z","closed_at":"2017-02-03T16:00:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\r\n\r\n#### Atom v1.12.0 breaks hotkeys.\r\nI have dvorak-qwerty keyboard https://sourceforge.net/projects/dvorakqwerty/\r\nIt means layout on dvorak, but hotkeys like on qwerty.
