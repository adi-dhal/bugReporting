os x 10.9 and atom 0.196\n\nWith open project-folder A and subfolder B and file c.rb\nClicking in iterm on c.rb (or running \"atom B/c.rb ) will open the file in the project.\nAlso running atom B/c.rb:10 will open the file and go to line 10\nClicking on a stacktrace along the line of /My/home/dir/A/B/c.rb will open the file in the project, good\nJust clicking /My/home/dir/A/B/c.rb:10 will open a new window with directory B and open file c.rb.\n   It will jump to the line, but it has opened the undesired new window.\n\nIf someone points me to the code where this happens i can probably fix it myself. Probably just a copy/paste error where a common function would create consistency.\n\nPS: related but not the same as issue #2745\nPPS: Nice tool, a general thanks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6626/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4847","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"DC78:366E:705373:ECA8C1:59D92B95","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=306>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=304>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"12b522d4531b239bed3c8190b847b664\"","status":"200 OK"}}
