By \"rate\", I mean the y-position delta per scroll event. It's hard to measure precisely, but if I compare 1.19.6 to the previous version, or any other native scrolling application (e.g. a browser), the same finger movement on my trackpad results in about 1/3 the movement. Scrolling *isn't* lagging or stuttering; it's just not shifting the viewport by the standard amount (i.e. it takes much longer to scroll through a large text file).\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. open a new editor\r\n2. fill it with dummy text\r\n3. scroll around using the trackpad\r\n4. compare to scrolling around in a browser or previous Atom version\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** the scrolling rate should be standard across all viewports\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** the scrolling rate is much lower in 1.19.6\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\natom 1.19.6\r\napm 1.18.4\r\nmacOS 10.12.6\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI'm using a high-DPI retina display; I don't have a standard display to test on so I'm not sure if this is related to the issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15567/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15566","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15566/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15566/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15566/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15566","id":255728735,"number":15566,"title":"Update

I have run Atom on safe mode and checked to make sure I have the most updated version of atom. I was working on a new project last night with no issues. Early today, I started to edit the file, and atom crashed. I checked the window for any clue of what might have happened, and a new window appeared on my screen called git. It listed over 1000 unstaged changes from Android studio. The only thing I can think to do next is to clear the save state or return to factory settings, but I don't want to lose all my data. I'm unsure about what changed between yesterday and today. It did not crash at all yesterday.

This has never happened before, I have had android studio installed the entire time I have had atom installed (a few months). \r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Every time I open up Atom and click, or type, 100%.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

Previously I was using the `TextEditor.presenter.startRow` and `TextEditor.presenter.endRow` properties, but since the `presenter` no longer exists I had to start using the `element` property. This is another reason that I would like to request that the `TextEditor.element` be added to the public API: so that my package remains stable on the next versions of Atom.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.19.5\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\nOS: Windows 10\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nLink to discussion in the Atom forums: https://discuss.atom.io/t/how-to-get-visible-lines-numbers-in-atom-editor/47065/7\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15559/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15558","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15558/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15558/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15558/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15558","id":255574614,"number":15558,"title":"Atom fails to load package preferences in settings-tab","user":{"login":"warcreap","id":9368160,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/9368160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/warcreap","html_url":"https://github.com/warcreap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warcreap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warcreap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warcreap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warcreap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warcreap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warcreap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warcreap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warcreap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warcreap/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-09-06T11:43:52Z","updated_at":"2017-09-06T20:36:37Z","closed_at":"2017-09-06T20:36:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello,\r\n\r\nI am working on a package for my company.\r\n\r\nCurrently I am having trouble with the config of my package.\r\nConfig in my main module looks as follows:\r\n```coffeescript\r\nMain =\r\n  config:\r\n    FirstSetting:\r\n      title: 'Some First Setting'\r\n      description: 'This is the first setting to make'\r\n      type: 'integer'\r\n      default: 1\r\n    SecondSetting:\r\n      title: 'Some second setting'\r\n      description: 'This definitly has to be done second'\r\n      type: 'integer'\r\n      default: 2\r\n\r\n  subscriptions: null\r\n  \r\n  activate: (state) -> ...\r\n\r\n# ...\r\n# ...\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = Main\r\n```\r\nMy problem is, that atom does not load the packages config into the settings view.\r\nNavigating to `Settings/Packages/my-package` results in an errormessage being displayed, telling me, that it `Failed to load my-package - try again later.`.\r\nOn the other hand the package works.

This leads to deprecation warnings in console \"DeprecationWarning: os.tmpDir() is deprecated. Use os.tmpdir() instead.\".\r\nThis warning  was refrenced in the following  #issues:\r\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14057\r\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13476\r\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13225\r\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13361\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n1.

Open a file\r\n2. `pane:split-<direction>-and-copy-active-item` (note: I have only tested with `right`)\r\n3. If there is no horizontal scrollbar, resize the panes so that the original pane can be horizontally scrolled\r\n4. Look at the scrollbar positions of the original pane and then attempt to horizontally scroll\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Scrollbars to correctly represent where the current file is, and for horizontally scrolling to horizontally scroll the file while maintaining the vertical position\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Both scrollbars reset to (0, 0) - that is, the vertical scrollbar resets to the top and the horizontal scrollbar resets to the left.  When attempting to horizontally scroll, the file position is reset to the top of the file.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.22.0-dev-700fdc592\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n/cc: @as-cii @nathansobo","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15551","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15551/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15551/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15551/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15551","id":255333635,"number":15551,"title":"Update language-coffee-script to v0.49.0","user":{"login":"50Wliu","id":2766036,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2766036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu","html_url":"https://github.com/50Wliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-09-05T16:19:27Z","updated_at":"2017-09-05T17:30:03Z","closed_at":"2017-09-05T17:30:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/15551","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15551","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15551.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15551.patch"},"body":"Introduces a very large overhaul of the language-coffee-script grammar, bringing it up-to-date with language-javascript.\r\n\r\nlanguage-html contains a temporary spec fix.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15551/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15550","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15550/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15550/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15550/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15550","id":255329673,"number":15550,"title":"Don't render block decorations located outside the visible range","user":{"login":"as-cii","id":482957,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/482957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii","html_url":"https://github.com/as-cii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-09-05T16:06:02Z","updated_at":"2017-09-06T09:11:19Z","closed_at":"2017-09-06T09:11:17Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/15550","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15550","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15550.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15550.patch"},"body":"Fixes https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15441\r\n\r\nPreviously, when trying to use block decorations on non-empty markers, Atom could sometimes throw an error if such markers ended or started at a position that was not currently rendered.\r\n\r\nIn fact, even if we already restricted the decoration query to markers that intersected the visible row range, markers that were only partially visible would still be considered for rendering.
