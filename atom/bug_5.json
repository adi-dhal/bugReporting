https://github.com/atom/text-buffer/pull/260\r\n\r\nThis is the first in a series of PRs to make Atom's syntax related features more flexible.\r\n\r\nCurrently, code related to auto-indentation and code folding is mostly implemented in a private class called `LanguageMode`, which is constructed with a `TextEditor` instance, and implements most of its functionality by directly manipulating the editor.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the `LanguageMode` class and reimplements its functionality in the existing `TokenizedBuffer` class, in a way that does *not* need to manipulate the editor directly. For example, instead of performing folds directly, the `TokenizedBuffer` exposes several pure methods for determining which buffer ranges should be folded.\r\n\r\nI converted the `TokenizedBuffer` and its test to JS. For the tests that were previously in `language-mode-spec.coffee`, I have either moved them into `tokenized-buffer-spec.js` or moved them into a new test file - `text-editor-test.js`. I created that new file because I had already converted these tests to JS before realizing that some of them were really about `TextEditor` and not `TokenizedBuffer`, and I didn't want to convert the entirety of `text-editor.coffee` to JS yet. Since the file is so large, we may want to do the conversion gradually.\r\n\r\n/cc @nathansobo ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15713/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15712","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15712/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15712/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15712/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15712","id":259598466,"number":15712,"title":"Update language-html to 0.48.0","user":{"login":"50Wliu","id":2766036,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2766036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu","html_url":"https://github.com/50Wliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-09-21T19:00:53Z","updated_at":"2017-09-21T19:45:42Z","closed_at":"2017-09-21T19:45:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/15712","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15712","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15712.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15712.patch"},"body":"### Requirements\r\n\r\n* Filling out the template is required.

Usage is apparently increasing without limits over time.\r\n\r\nHaving had Atom installed for several months, I have the following contents in the given folder (along with sizes and timestamps of most-recently-modified file in each subdirectory):\r\n\r\n> 595M    2017-06-16 04:04        ./app-1.18.0\r\n> 582M    2017-08-08 18:13        ./app-1.19.0\r\n> 581M    2017-08-14 22:47        ./app-1.19.1\r\n> 581M    2017-08-17 02:33        ./app-1.19.2\r\n> 583M    2017-08-22 23:14        ./app-1.19.3\r\n> 583M    2017-08-28 19:34        ./app-1.19.4\r\n> 4.0K    2017-08-28 19:33        ./bin\r\n> 1.1G    2017-08-28 19:33        ./packages\r\n> 4.5G    2017-08-30 16:41        .\r\n> \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. [First Step]\r\n2. [Second Step]\r\n3. [and so on...]\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\n\r\nUsage is limited and reasonably small, and does not grow boundlessly over time.  Presumably, this means that older versions should be deleted (perhaps retain the current version and the previous version, and deleted anything older than that?  also the downloaded packages could presumably be deleted as soon as they've been installed?)\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\n\r\nDisk usage grows boundlessly.  For users trying to run an OS off a modest-sized SSD (e.g. 80GB) the level of usage growth is so large that it will become problematic in reasonably short timespans.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\n\r\nEvery time, AFAICT.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nVersions are as shown in the file dump above.

Have a UTF-8 file with unicode U+0091 in it.\r\n2. Open file in VS code to have it displayed as �\r\n3. Make change somewhere in file other than the hex 91 character and save file\r\n4. Open in notepad++ to see the character is now different as the hex in the file for U+0091 has been rewritten as � (0xEFBFBD) from the 0x91 it was previously.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** When you open a file with Unicode characters, U+0091 in particular, it renders as the � character. If you change ANYTHING but that character, and save the file, unaltered character values should not change. When opening in another editor, that supports said Unicode character, it should render it fine. That character value should not be changed on save when the character was never altered during the edit.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** When you open a file with Unicode characters U+0091 in particular, it renders as the � character. If you change ANYTHING but that character, and save the file, the hex value for what should be U+0091 is changed to 0xEFBFBD.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom     : 1.20.0\r\nElectron : 1.6.9\r\nChrome : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode     : 7.4.0\r\nOS         : Windows 7 Pro\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nNone\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15692","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15692/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15692/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15692/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15692","id":258931793,"number":15692,"title":"Pane on did change path","user":{"login":"UziTech","id":97994,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/97994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech","html_url":"https://github.com/UziTech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722948,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-review","name":"needs-review","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-09-19T19:14:14Z","updated_at":"2017-09-28T18:51:13Z","closed_at":"2017-09-28T18:51:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/15692","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15692","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15692.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15692.patch"},"body":"\r\n### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nChange a pane elements `.dataset.activeItemPath` and `.dataset.activeItemName` when the path changes.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nWe must be able to understand the design of your change from this description.
