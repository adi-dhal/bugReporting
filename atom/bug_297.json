This is useful, but the problem is that the syntax is fixed, no other values can be passed in other then line, column.\n\nI would like Atom to also read in URL query parameter syntax and send those values through as options to the workspace opener. I don't mean we should break the existing syntax for line column, but instead provide an alternative syntax using query parameter syntax.\n\nFor example these would all be equivalent:\n\n```\n/my/path/to/open/test.txt:10:1\n/my/path/to/open/test.txt:10?initialColumn=1\n/my/path/to/open/test.txt?initialLine=10&initialColumn=1\n```\n\nThe reason for making this change is because then other workspace openers could could read in similar values that apply to them. For example I have an outliner editor (https://atom.io/packages/foldingtext-for-atom) that can filter the outline view with a search. I would like the option to provide an initial search value when opening an outline file, similar to how initial line and column is now provided to the default editor. If query parameter options were available in Atom I could then open a path like this:\n\n```\n/my/path/to/open/test.ftml?search=stuff\n```\n\nAnd `search: stuff` would get passed through to my opener as an option.\n\nThe implementation would be pretty strait forward:\n1. In `atom-application.coffee::locationForPathToOpen` strip and store query parameters key values from the path right before the code that does: `pathToOpen = pathToOpen.replace(/[:\\s]+$/, '')`.\n2. Include those key values along with the initialLine and initialColumn key values that are being returned.\n3. In `window-event-handler.coffee` process the `open-locations` handler a bit differently so that all location metadata gets passed through to `atom.workspace.open` instead of just the line and column.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6876/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6875","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6875/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6875/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6875/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6875","id":78667808,"number":6875,"title":"API

This is a list of the packages using deprecated APIs, their owners and each package's impact. This data reflects a subset of the user population (those who have upgraded to 201). Affected numbers are based on unique users catching the deprecations.\n\nIf you are a maintainer on this list please note that we will be removing deprecated APIs on **June 1st**. See the [blog post](http://blog.atom.io/2015/05/01/removing-deprecated-apis.html) for more info. Note that upgrading to the new APIs will decrease breakage, increase speed, and generally be better for everyone. \n### Upgrading your package\n\nWe have a few guides for upgrading your package or theme: \n- [Upgrading your package](https://atom.io/docs/latest/upgrading-to-1-0-apis-upgrading-your-package)\n- [Upgrading your package styles or UI theme](https://atom.io/docs/latest/upgrading-to-1-0-apis-upgrading-your-ui-theme-or-package-selectors)\n- [Upgrading your syntax theme](https://atom.io/docs/latest/upgrading-to-1-0-apis-upgrading-your-syntax-theme)\n- If you do only one thing, use [atom-space-pen-views](https://github.com/atom/atom-space-pen-views) for the `View` class rather than importing them from atom. See the [package upgrade guide](https://atom.io/docs/latest/upgrading-to-1-0-apis-upgrading-your-package#upgrading-your-views) for details.\n- Not sure what deprecations your package is generating? See https://gist.github.com/benogle/6d09e295c84b717ef9b4 for a list\n### Need help upgrading?\n\nThe community and the core team can offer some help:\n- Post an issue on the [forum](https://discuss.atom.io/)\n- Get help in the [slack room](http://atom-slack.herokuapp.com/)\n- If you're stuck, post an issue on [atom/atom](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues)\n### Package abandoned?\n\nIf your package is abandoned or supplanted by something in core, please comment with the package name and we can take steps to remove it from the package listing and people's install.\n\nHowever, **_do not delete the package repo from GitHub before unpublishing**_, as this will make it so that you can't unpublish from the package registry.\n### Notes\n- We are currently working on ways to minimize pain from deprecations. We will try hard to keep things going smoothly through the transition\n- It appears there are many many people still using outdated packages. We have taken steps in v0.200 to be more aggressive about upgrading packages. \n- If you want to tinker with the data, it is all here: https://github.com/benogle/deprecation-data\n\n_Generated: Wed
