As far as I’ve tested with it, I did not\nfind any negative and/or unexpected behaviour with the restrictions removed, but of course I did not test with all possible languages Atom supports.\n\nIf it turns out there is a language that does have negative effects from this change, I would argue that the correct place to fix that is in the specific language package by altering the increaseIndentPattern and/or (more likely) the decreaseIndentPattern, instead of relying on these hard coded restrictions.\n\nBefore:\n![before](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4171547/7628544/db28e958-fa24-11e4-9599-126bd61ef749.gif)\nAs you can see here the bracket isn't indented correctly when moving it to the next line. The decreaseIndentPattern is correct as it does increase when removing and typing in the bracket again on the same line.\n\nAfter:\n![after](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4171547/7628620/df8dfb5e-fa25-11e4-9056-b58b4aee31fa.gif)\nAfter removing the hard coded restrictions, the bracket is indented as expected.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6780","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6780/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6780/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6780/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6780","id":76274107,"number":6780,"title":"Uncaught
