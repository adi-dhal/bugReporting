the logic lacked handling of multiple matches of the\nincrease/decrease regexs, so things like the following javascript\nwould not be handled correctly (the last line would be indented).\n\n``` js\nif (test) {\n  foo({a:1\n  })};\nvar t = \"this should be at indentation 0\";\n```\n\nFixed that.\n\nAlso revisited the logic regarding decreaseIndent and\ndecreaseNextIndent. It did not seem very logical that decreaseIndent\ndid _not_ correspond to increaseIndent: decreaseIndent regarded the\ncurrent line whereas increaseIndent regarded the next line (just like\ndecreaseNextIndent). For that reason I renamed decreaseIndent to\ndecreaseThisIndent and decreaseNextIndent to decreaseIndent. This way\nwe also avoid a whole lot of issues related to the concept of\ndecreaseNextIndent, because most of the language packages I looked at\nhave not yet adopted it but the semantics of decreaseIndent had\nchanged. So now the semantics of decreaseIndent is back to what it was\nand decreaseThisIndent is the new concept.\n\nAlso now using the tokenized line to determine whether a in-/decrease\npattern appears within a quoted string (and ignoring it in that case),\nrather than requiring regexes for checking whether or not the\noccurrence is within a quoted string or not -- the examples I saw for\nthat were wrong, too (e.g., things like `/} [^\"] /` are non-sense,\nbecause things like `} var x = \"hey\"` are perfectly fine). One really\nneeds to reason about balanced quotation to get it right, and the\ntokenizer already does that for us, so let's use it rather than\nreinventing the wheel. The decrease/increase regexes can now be much\nsimpler in the language packages.\n\nIn this version we use decreaseIndentPattern as the default value for decreaseThisIndentPattern, which is OK, because that pattern is never applied (matched) more than once, which was the previous behavior.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10384/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10383","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10383/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10383/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10383/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10383","id":126088052,"number":10383,"title":"Installation
