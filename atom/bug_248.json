But whenever I run `atom` I get the error:\n\n`nohup: failed to run command ‘/tmp/user/1000/atom-build/Atom/atom’: No such file or directory`\n\nThen I tried to use the Debian package at [here](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/download/v1.0.7/atom-amd64.deb) to install Atom (via running `sudo dpkg -i atom-amd64.deb`) but yet again running `atom` gives:\n\n`nohup: failed to run

There are many, many things you can do at this point.\n- Atom.io crashes.\n## Other Tests\n\nMy situation might be a bit _unique_ so again I will apologize if it makes it hard to debug. I have tested this same setup using a linux samba share as well as a Windows file share and Atom.io behaves very well and **_never crashes**_ in those setups.  It might be something to do with how the Mac (Yosemite) samba shares are created.\n\nAll shares I used required authentication different from that of my Windows workstation.

If I have a string with accents, and try to use `Buffer.byteLength`, it returns the same as `string.length`. But only in certains conditions.\n\nThe only way I found out on how to always reproduce this error is paste, line by line, the code below in the console. It gives us an error for the global variable json:\n\n``` javascript\nvar data = {\"id\":4,\"name\":\"Critério de Aceitação\",\"value\":\"\"};\n\n// If i just copy-paste all these lines, the results are correct.\n// But, if I paste one by one these lines in the console, they give the following cases:\njson = JSON.stringify(data);\nconsole.log(Buffer.byteLength(json)); // 50\nconsole.log(Buffer.byteLength(JSON.stringify(data))); // 53\n```\n\nBut I found the problem while working on a plugin that try to POST a JSON to a HTTPS Redmine service. It was a CoffeeScript plugin, so there's no possible way to create global variables. It was really strange when I logged into console and saw different results for different ways of calling this method. Somehow, I wasn't able to reproduce this error on IO.js nor in Node.JS alone.\n\nIn my plugin, I found this bug in the following lines:\n\n``` coffee\n  # data is a { issue: { project_id: 99, title: \"Sóme códe\" }} - like object\n    result = ''\n    apiKey = atom.config.get('plugin.redmine_api_key')\n    json = JSON.stringify(data)\n    size = Buffer.byteLength(json)\n    size < Buffer.byteLength(JSON.stringify(data)) # This returned TRUE!\n```\n\nBut when I tried to create a simple package trying to reproduce this error, this did not happened.\n\nWhat I did to correct this on my package was add `json = ''` before the line that stringifies my JS object. To help more in debugging this (really!) strange problem, the `title` field (the one that is possible to come with accents) was typed by a user, using a `TextEditorView`.\n\nAtom version: 1.0.4\nOS: Ubuntu Linux  14.04\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8353","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8353/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8353/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8353/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8353","id":100650304,"number":8353,"title":"Autocomplete-plus removes options upon typing last character","user":{"login":"Anfa-am","id":6219281,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6219281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Anfa-am","html_url":"https://github.com/Anfa-am","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Anfa-am/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Anfa-am/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Anfa-am/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Anfa-am/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Anfa-am/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Anfa-am/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Anfa-am/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Anfa-am/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Anfa-am/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-08-12T22:38:08Z","updated_at":"2015-08-12T23:07:12Z","closed_at":"2015-08-12T23:07:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When typing  something like 'div' the options disappear as soon as you type the 'v'.
