guys,\n\nFirst I need to thank you for the great Editor.\n\nIt seems like the App it's adding a new line in the bottom of the file each time I save the document.\n I use it for PHP/WEB applications and it is annoying, mostly when you need to call variables/values from file_content, when during the fact that Atom adds new lines in the bottom, the PHP interprets it as space behind the value and throws Fatal Errors. \nIf I edit the file outside the Atom and remove that spare line, everything goes well.\n\nI tried looking for an option in this matter in the Settings of Atom and couldn't find any concludent, so if you thing this report comes in an error manner (mine especially), please feel free to announce me in any way.\n\nThank you

Here's usually what happens.\n1. Get an issue with Atom locking files from git via cmd (usually permission error due to atom or file is locked for some reason)\n2. Close Atom\n3. Perform git actions\n4. Open atom\n   - have tried via cmd and via icon\n5. If not tried from cmd, \"open folder\" and select folder that was previously opened before close\n\n**Expected** atom to open folder selected from dialog or folder 'atom' was run from in cmd\n**Actual** folder is never opened. It seems to unfocus on atom completely. It won't even load files from that folder when selected from \"open file\" or dragged into atom.\n\n_Workaround_ is to restart your PC. \n\nNot sure what is going on here, and it's not the easiest to reproduce. I've tired safe mode and looked everywhere for possible errors. Would love not to restart my computer every time this happens, which is often. \n\nNot sure when this was last working, as it was still and issue for me prior to v1.0.0, but didn't happen as often.\n\nPlease let me know if there's any other information I can provide.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7625/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7624","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7624/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7624/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7624/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/7624","id":92369060,"number":7624,"title":":apple: Menus: replace three period with ellipsis","user":{"login":"isghe","id":1006078,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isghe","html_url":"https://github.com/isghe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isghe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isghe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isghe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isghe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isghe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isghe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isghe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isghe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isghe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mnquintana","id":823545,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/823545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana","html_url":"https://github.com/mnquintana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mnquintana","id":823545,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/823545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana","html_url":"https://github.com/mnquintana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":14,"created_at":"2015-07-01T12:25:33Z","updated_at":"2015-07-02T16:07:42Z","closed_at":"2015-07-02T14:50:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/7624","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/7624","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/7624.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/7624.patch"},"body":"From:\n[OS X Human Interface Guidelines -Terminology and Wording](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/TerminologyWording.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000957-CH15-SW3)\n\n> IMPORTANT\n> \n> Be sure to create the ellipsis character using the key combination Option-; (Option-semicolon).
