I want to extract the most general components possible. Things like panels, colors, selected states, highlighted states, etc. We should be able to reduce the complexity of the themes, the package css, and make it easier for a new package to get an interface up and running.\n\nI've created a theme from scratch with inspiration from the dark-ui theme. The new theme is `neue-dark-ui`. So far, I feel like I am headed down the right path. Please look through it. I want opinions. \n\nIn using general classes, we should be able to get really far by adding general classes to our package interface components (like `warning`, `info`, `tool-panel`) etc. This is a little less semantic class naming in some cases (see the treeview pull: https://github.com/atom/tree-view/pull/4)\n\nSo far, I've spent the most time with the tree view. See the pull here: https://github.com/atom/tree-view/pull/4\n\n@mdo if you wanna, I'm here. I'm already looking at bootstrap as inspiration.\n- [x] Make tabs use this \n- [x] Make find and replace use this (preview-list is complicated)\n- [x] Create a `ui-test` package that uses all the components\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/739/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/738","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/738/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/738/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/738/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/738","id":18371964,"number":738,"title":"Themes can be installed","user":{"login":"mcolyer","id":1424,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1424?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer","html_url":"https://github.com/mcolyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-08-21T18:31:08Z","updated_at":"2013-08-30T22:11:20Z","closed_at":"2013-08-30T22:11:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Currently if a user wants to use a 3rd party theme it's necessary to copy it into ~/.atom/themes/.

After `apm link`ing, it just worked. \n- I dont want to run all the tests for core. Is a little weird that I need to have the runner for the whole app open. \n- Would be really cool to run them on the terminal. `apm test` or something. \n- I want to focus my whole package. I want it to default to that. \n### Events\n- Was hard to find the right events. Even harder to know when they fire, and when they dont. \n- Took a bit to understand the bubbling events. A 2 sentence explanation about the views as dom nodes, it fires on a chils and bubbles + events with `:` are dom bubbling events would have been sufficient. \n- Correct ways to subscribe and unsubscribe.\n- My expectation on some of the events was different than actual behavior\n- I expected some events to be there that arent (i.e. `active-view-changed`, or `editor:active-editor-changed` when user changes focus to a different split).\n### Themes\n- Dealing with multiple themes is hard. Using the colors will alleviate a bit of the issue, but something more robust might be necessary.\n- Knowing about the currently implemented html constructs available to me would be useful (how do I make a button? set of toggle buttons? etc.)\n\nI'll add more as it hits me. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/725/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/724","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/724/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/724/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/724/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/724","id":18260075,"number":724,"title":"High level goals for private alpha","user":{"login":"nathansobo","id":1789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo","html_url":"https://github.com/nathansobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2013-08-19T19:57:01Z","updated_at":"2013-08-29T17:55:15Z","closed_at":"2013-08-29T17:55:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This issue should serve as a starting point about the high level goals for private alpha. We can add comments or edit the body of the issue directly as our vision evolves. Also, we can add checklists below each of the major items to get more specific.\n- **Polish the user experience**\n  First and foremost, Atom is a **product**. Atom needs to feel familiar and inviting. This includes a solid introductory experience and parity with the most important features of Sublime.\n- **Lay solid groundwork for a package ecosystem**\n  Extensibility is one of Atom's key value propositions, so a smooth experience for creating and maintaining packages is just as important as the user experience. The package development, dependency and publishing workflow needs to be solid. We also want to have a mechanism for clearly communicating with package authors about breaking API changes.\n- **Tighten up the view layer**\n  Our current approach to the view layer need some improvement. We want to actively promote the use of the M-V-VM design pattern, provide some declarative event binding mechanisms in the view layer, and improve the performance of the typical package specs. We don't want the current approach to be used as an example in a bunch of new packages, so it's important to improve it now.\n- **Get atom.io online with some exciting articles and documentation**\n  We'd love to send our private alpha candidates to a nice site with information about what Atom is, the philosophies and technologies behind it, and guidance for how to get started.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/724/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/723","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/723/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/723/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/723/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/723","id":18212046,"number":723,"title":"editing

Ideally this would be done automatically at release time but for now it's just a simple grunt task that needs to be run by hand after releasing. In the future this can be more fully automated. Note: You'll need the atom-docs repo checked out as a sibling to your atom repository otherwise the relative paths in these scripts will fail.\n\nThis setup should be considered the precursor to the documentation that will be available on atom.io.
