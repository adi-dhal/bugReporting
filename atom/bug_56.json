I know I shouldn't open them in Atom, but sometimes I misclick and open one of these. In that case Atom freezes with `Loading Archive` message. If the file is not too big, it will eventually load, but editor is not usable during this time. If the file is too big it will eventually display a message where I can either _wait more_ or _close_. Unfortunately the _close_  closes the entire window.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open a directory containing a large (binary) file\r\n2. (Mis)click the file in Atom\r\n3. Atom freezes while the file is loaded \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\n\r\nOne or more of the following:\r\n\r\n* Atom asks if I want to open this file (normally you don't open large binary files, for large text files you might want to say yes and wait a bit)\r\n* Atom starts loading, but UI remains responsive so I can close the tab and continue working\r\n* Atom displays a preview but requires additional action to actually open the file\r\n* When Atom eventually asks if I want to kill the process, just close the tab, don't kill the whole window\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\n\r\n* Atom UI freezes, making it unusable for > 1 min\r\n* Atom asks if I want to close the file, but this closes entire window\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\n\r\nAlways for a sufficiently large file\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.15.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\nMac OS X 10.12.4 (16E195)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14172/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14171","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14171/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14171/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14171/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14171","id":220966696,"number":14171,"title":"Issue installing Atom on Ubuntu Mate on Pi3 - error: 'E: Unable to locate package atom'","user":{"login":"kleindienst","id":27288945,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/27288945?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kleindienst","html_url":"https://github.com/kleindienst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kleindienst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kleindienst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kleindienst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kleindienst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kleindienst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kleindienst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kleindienst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kleindienst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kleindienst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-04-11T14:16:14Z","updated_at":"2017-05-29T10:38:19Z","closed_at":"2017-04-11T14:57:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

This will simplify packages, provide a central place for improvements and reduce the resource overhead of multiple watchers.\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\nAs we only want to watch the files that relate to the project and not provide a broad watch-anywhere API I propose a simple event notification from atom.project;\r\n\r\n`atom.project.onDidChangeFiles`\r\n\r\nThe event object is described as:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nChangedFilesEvent = {\r\n  changes: Array<ChangedFileEvent>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the changes with in;\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nChangedFileEvent = {\r\n  oldPath: String,\r\n  newPath: String\r\n  type: Added | Changed | Deleted | Renamed\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach of the types would effectively look like this;\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\naddedFile = { oldPath: '~/added.txt', type: 'Added' }\r\ndeletedFile = { oldPath: '~/deleted.txt', type: 'Deleted' }\r\nrenamedFile = { oldPath: '~/old.txt', newPath: '~/new.txt', type: 'Rename' }\r\nchangedFile = { oldPath: '~/file.txt', newPath: '~/file.txt', type: 'Changed' }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Throttling\r\n\r\nWe should throttle events as to not overwhelm consumers. The api provides an array so they can be batched. \r\n\r\n## Considerations\r\n\r\n1. The standard Node api supports recursive watching on Windows (since 5.0) and MacOS however does not provide such a facility for Linux. It also does not support throttling or rename detection.\r\n2. Is Chokidar the right client?  It adds rename/native Mac support/recursive Windows workarounds. This is because it aims to be compatible with much older Node clients. Does it get in the way of more recent ones.\r\n3. Renames may appear as add/delete because of the way other tools handle this (e.g. git). We can either try and resolve that or consider having add/delete instead of rename entirely (simplifies event)\r\n4. The event api supplies an array of batched changes however it will not normalize them so it could easily consist of a file change event immediately followed by a delete event.\r\n5. A folder deletion could cause a massive amount of file changed events. Not much we can do about this I think.\r\n6. File changes will not be recognized on network shares due to limitations of the network file change protocols. Polling is an option but can be resource intensive.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14163/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14162","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14162/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14162/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14162/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14162","id":220775850,"number":14162,"title":"Add vibrancy support for macOS","user":{"login":"chrisdrackett","id":4378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrackett","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdrackett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrackett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrackett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrackett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrackett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrackett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrackett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrackett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrackett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrackett/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":14,"created_at":"2017-04-10T21:26:18Z","updated_at":"2017-08-06T05:57:26Z","closed_at":"2017-07-31T18:51:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

You can use `atom.packages.onDidTriggerActivationHook()` to listen for `\"'core:loaded-shell-environment\"`, but it may have already been triggered. In Nuclide, we currently have [a package][1] whose entire point is to resolve a promise when it's activated by the hook 😝\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to add a new AtomEnvironment method that allows you to register a callback to be invoked immediately if the shell environment is already loaded or, otherwise, once it loads:\r\n\r\n`atom.whenShellEnvironmentLoaded(cb: () => void): Disposable`\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nThere are currently three precedents for this kind of event handling in Atom:\r\n\r\n1. `onDidBlah()` functions which only invoke their callbacks on events subsequent to registration (of which there are implied to be multiple)\r\n2. `observeBlah()` functions which provide the semantics we're after but (currently, at least) imply multiple events\r\n3. `getBlahPromise()` provides similar semantics. (This isn't a strong precedent though—the only example I'm aware of is `atom.views.getNextUpdatePromise()`). Looking ahead, though, if more promise-returning methods are added, we'll almost certainly require cancelability at some point. That would probably mean adding cancelation tokens which would fragment the APIs between cancelation tokens and disposables.\r\n\r\nThe proposed version fits with the established API patterns (callback-accepting, disposable-returning functions) but establishes a new prefix (\"when\") that has the same semantics as `observeBlah()` functions but is used when the callback will only be called once.\r\n\r\ncc @maxbrunsfeld @nathansobo \r\n\r\n[1]:
