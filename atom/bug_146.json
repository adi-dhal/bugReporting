Use the command line (Bash, Zsh, whatever you like) in either MSysGit (Git for Windows) or MSys2.\n2. Go to some directory.\n3. Run `atom .` \n\n**Expected behavior:** Atom will open a new window with the current directory.\n\n**Actual behavior:** Atom opened a new window with `D:\\`.\n### Versions\n\nOnly since 1.7.0 - was working as expected before.\n\nYou can get this information from executing `atom --version` and `apm --version` at the command line.

Was able to find repro steps that work every time.\nIs stepping through random parts of atom source(from app.asar) not supported and will cause random things like this? I have no special tools from atom just the editor.\nWas talking with @lee-dohm on the atom slack channel and he recommended I open a new issue for this.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open atom in safe mode.\n2. Ensure you have Tab Type set to auto.\n3. Open a new tab and type some text.\n4. Open a new empty tab.\n5. Put a breakpoint in the function `TextEditor.prototype.usesSoftTabs` in text-editor.js. I put it on the first line of the function which is line 2261.\n6. Split the empty tab down.\n7. Atom is now \"soft locked\", can't add text to any of the open tabs while other parts of the UI work fine.\n8. Switch to tab with text from step 3, tab is empty no text visible.\n9. Uncaught exception when clicking in the tab.\n\nWhat is strange is that execution doesn't stop on the breakpoint when doing split down.\nThe execution does however stop on the breakpoint on some other actions. For example new tab stops while split tab doesn't stop.\nAlso just putting a breakpoint on this line and splitting causes problems with syntax coloring being gone and other random things. The exception seems to just be a special case of this.\n\n**Expected behavior:** Atom to not throw an exception and stop working, perhaps to break on the breakpoint I added.\n\n**Actual behavior:**\n\n**Atom Version**: 1.6.2\n**System**: Microsoft Windows 7 Professional \n**Thrown From**: Atom Core\n### Stack Trace\n\nUncaught Error: Undefined screen line when clipping screen

Description\n\nIt's way too easy to close tabs by mistake. This is especially annoying for the julia console tab, which cannot be reopened in the same place with built-in shortcuts. \n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open a bunch of tabs\n2. Click on a different tab to select it\n3. Whoops, closed it by mistake\n4. Grit teeth, reopen\n\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]\n\nIn google chrome, only the currently active tab has a close button. To close a different tab takes two clicks; one to select, one to close.\n\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\n\nThe close button (box? what do you call it?) actually has an even bigger active area than it looks like, so anywhere towards the right side of the text ends up closing the tab. Ideally, you'd reproduce the Chrome-like behavior as above; but even if not, the close button cannot be sensitive to clicks over title text, so make the active area smaller please.\n### Versions\n\nI'm on 1.6.2, but probably all versions.\n\n(Note: Atom is awesome in general, but this makes me angry every time.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11448/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11447","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11447/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11447/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11447/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11447","id":148105235,"number":11447,"title":"CTRL scrolling the cursor behaviour is faulty in that the cursor does not jump to the start of words when scrolling forwards.","user":{"login":"Neutrino-Sunset","id":18445931,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/18445931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neutrino-Sunset","html_url":"https://github.com/Neutrino-Sunset","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neutrino-Sunset/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neutrino-Sunset/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neutrino-Sunset/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neutrino-Sunset/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neutrino-Sunset/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neutrino-Sunset/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neutrino-Sunset/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neutrino-Sunset/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neutrino-Sunset/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":171329633,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-reproduction","name":"needs-reproduction","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-04-13T15:50:58Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T15:51:24Z","closed_at":"2016-05-04T15:51:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Open a text document.\nPaste a paragraph of text.\nHold CTRL and scroll backwards and forwards.\n\nWhen holding the CTRL button and scrolling forward the cursor jumps to the end of each word, i.e to the whitespace preceeding the next word.

mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode)?\n- [x ] Are you running the [latest version of

guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [ x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [ x] Are you reporting to the [correct

request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\nI think it's self-explanatory. Could it be because of the Chromium engine - Visual Studio Code is having the same issue?!\nTwo disclaimers:\n-I don't think this requires safe mode or debugging\n-first-time contributor in GitHub(Markdown's still not my strength)\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n**Expected behavior:** The font of the menu should be crisp and clear.\n\n**Actual behavior:** The font of the top menu(the triggering text only) appears blurry. The cascade items that open are OK.\n### Versions\n\nAtom is latest 1.6.2, the OS is latest Windows 10 64bit with all the

Unless I hover the mouse over a tab title and wait a moment so that the tooltip reveals the path, tab switching becomes a bit of a guessing game.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/298883/14483064/538fc1d2-0186-11e6-8df3-374176fe69ab.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/298883/14483078/81fd647a-0186-11e6-9115-6f295a9ebc14.png)\n\nOther editors show you a proper list of open documents/tabs when holding down the tab switching shortcut (CTRL+TAB for me on Windows). I can then easily cycle through the list directly to the tab I want to focus. The order of the list is usually the same as the current tab cycling order, rather than the ordinal position in the UI. i.e. the current tab is first in the list, the previous tab is next, and so forth.\n\nAnother common addition that usually goes along with this is either having a list of the open tabs available from a dropdown button on the tab bar, or in one of the application menus.\n\nVisual Studio provides a good experience for this:\n![vs2015-tab-switching](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/298883/14482958/89a2fad8-0185-11e6-8de5-ab850a65f16c.gif)\n\nVSCode is also similarly helpful:\n![vscode-tab-switching](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/298883/14483022/f631cd32-0185-11e6-95de-127edec3d3b4.gif)\n\nSublime Text exposes the tab list as a dropdown, but not when holding down the shortcut. Even so, it's still better than having to cycle through tabs guessing, or having to wait for each tooltip to display:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/298883/14482895/e454cef8-0184-11e6-880d-717a4efc710a.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11439/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11438","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11438/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11438/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11438/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11438","id":147938264,"number":11438,"title":"Don't load packages starting with a dot","user":{"login":"kuychaco","id":7910250,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7910250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuychaco","html_url":"https://github.com/kuychaco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuychaco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuychaco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuychaco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuychaco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuychaco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuychaco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuychaco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuychaco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuychaco/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-04-13T03:42:12Z","updated_at":"2016-04-13T07:39:56Z","closed_at":"2016-04-13T07:39:56Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/11438","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11438","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11438.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11438.patch"},"body":"Fixes #9805\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11438/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11437","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11437/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11437/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11437/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11437","id":147825206,"number":11437,"title":"Ignore autorun on our buffered process commands.
