I installed Atom for the first time with the new installer. While I expected to be presented with at least _some_ options, the installer just started installing right away.\n\nSecondly, in Explorer every context menu now has an item `Open with Atom`. I don't want that, Windows has 'Open with' functionality built in and it just clutters these menus (besides the fact that is shows up for _all_ files and folders, while I for example don't expect to ever open an image with Atom). \n\nSo I find the installer to behave very aggressive, I at least expect to be presented with a confirmation screen (\"This will install Atom in C:...\\AppData, do you want to proceed?\"). That it started installing right away really wasn't the behavior I expected.

However, the edits show up and git diff even highlights them.\n\nAlso PR #1271 supposedly fixed #693 (Closing file buffers when a file gets removed via git i.e. switching branches, deleting, etc.) but that is not happening for me. When I switch branches and a file gets removed, it stays open in Atom with no indication that it's not supposed to be there.\n\nEdit: Personally I think a file getting removed via git should automatically close the buffer, while a file getting removed in another way should prompt you. \"This file no longer exists, do you want to keep it open?\". This is how Notepad++ handles the situation and I think that is the best way.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4982/reactions","total_count":25,"+1":24,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4981","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4981/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4981/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4981/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4981","id":53963042,"number":4981,"title":"Spellchecker crashes atom","user":{"login":"rwhogg","id":2373856,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2373856?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwhogg","html_url":"https://github.com/rwhogg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwhogg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwhogg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwhogg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwhogg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwhogg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwhogg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwhogg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwhogg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwhogg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-01-10T16:28:29Z","updated_at":"2015-01-10T16:41:55Z","closed_at":"2015-01-10T16:41:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Trying to use the spellchecker crashes atom.\n\nI'm using openSUSE 13.1 on GNOME 3, with version 0.168.0 (most recent as of now).

sure if I should consider this a bug, but I get weird errors with elements size in Travis that should not occurs. \n\nFor instance take [this build](https://travis-ci.org/abe33/atom-table-edit), the tests are all green on my computer, but fails on Travis with errors like this one: \n\n```\nit sets the proper width and height on the table rows container\n  Expected 383 to be close to 400, -1. (spec/table-element-spec.coffee:173:39)\n```\n\nThe thing is that I explicitely set a width of 400px in a stylesheet I inject during tests to make my computation. There's no padding, every elements have a `border-box` box sizing and everything is fine locally (minus some differences due to int/float differences in API, like comparing a box with a percentage width by using `getBoundingClientRect` against `offsetWitdth` or `offsetHeight`). But as you can see the tests fails by quite an amount, and I can't make all these tests use a `toBeCloseTo` expectaction with a `-2` or `-3` precision, it would be meaningless.\n\nIs there some specificity that should be considered when writing this kind of tests for Travis? \nIs it simply stupid of me to try to test this computations using absolute values in my test setup?\nShall I measure everything in the setup instead?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4972/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4971","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4971/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4971/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4971/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/4971","id":53932263,"number":4971,"title":"Stop eval'ing .cson files","user":{"login":"kevinsawicki","id":671378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/671378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinsawicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-01-10T00:01:59Z","updated_at":"2015-01-13T01:06:41Z","closed_at":"2015-01-13T01:06:39Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/4971","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/4971","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/4971.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/4971.patch"},"body":"This pull request upgrades the [season](https://github.com/atom/season) version to `5.0` which uses the latest version of [cson-safe](https://github.com/groupon/cson-safe).\n\nThe main upside here is that `cson-safe` doesn't eval the files but instead parses them safely just like `JSON.parse` does.\n\nThis will break any `.cson` files that contain code since they will no longer parse correctly.

Or as suggested, leave it OFF at first.\n\nAnother important point is that Atom is NOT simply collecting statistical data!
