Description of the Change\r\n\r\nThis enables native tabs on macOS. Under `macOS > Menu > View` there will be a \"Show Tab Bar\" option.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-06-03 at 5 10 32 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378023/26751932/aedfc05a-487f-11e7-9643-8047242b3bcb.png)\r\n\r\nWhich lets you combine multiple Atom windows and tab between them:\r\n\r\n![native-tabs](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378023/26751925/80bf8d68-487f-11e7-91c6-2c1a767b3c5f.gif)\r\n\r\n> Note: Only available if `Atom > Settings > Core > Title Bar` is set to `native`.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nWas wondering if it should be a config, but I think it's not needed. Because:\r\n\r\n1. Electron is smart enough to [only show](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/dfab1043d98067b43b45d8dcbe9d0b84d4820555/atom/browser/native_window_mac.mm#L789-L790) the native tabs if there is also a native title bar. So [issues](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14197) with hidden/custom title bar shouldn't be a problem.\r\n2. You can control if Atom should open as a native tab or new window by going to `macOS > System Preferences > Docks` and change this:\r\n\r\n    ![screen shot 2017-06-03 at 4 40 33 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378023/26751735/7b90a89e-487b-11e7-8439-2f70d267559b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nIt's part of the `browserWindow` options.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nMakes it possible to tab between multiple Atom windows.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nPeople might not like this change if:\r\n\r\n1. They prefer opening as tabs for all other apps (like Finder), but not for Atom.\r\n2. They don't want to switch to a custom title bar.\r\n\r\nSomething else I noticed: If you have the DevTools open (as a separate window) and close the Atom window, the DevTools window moves as a tab to another existing Atom window. Not sure if that's an edge case to be ok with?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14197\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14711/reactions","total_count":59,"+1":46,"-1":0,"laugh":2,"hooray":5,"confused":0,"heart":6}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14710","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14710/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14710/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14710/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14710","id":233331821,"number":14710,"title":"Touch Screen Scrolling Doesn't Work","user":{"login":"c0yote","id":5217767,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5217767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c0yote","html_url":"https://github.com/c0yote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c0yote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c0yote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c0yote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c0yote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c0yote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c0yote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c0yote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c0yote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c0yote/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-06-03T00:39:05Z","updated_at":"2017-06-05T17:47:20Z","closed_at":"2017-06-05T17:47:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

This means that files that are followed by trailing whitespace in .gitignore/exclude always show up as new.\r\n\r\nObviously no one is going to create such files on purpose. I only got bitten by this due to Windows being Windows and adding a trailing whitespace when I innocently did a simple `echo` command. 😛\r\n\r\nI checked the git-diff package first and saw that the actual calculation is implemented in Atom using the git-utils npm package, which I think uses libgit2. This might be an issue in libgit2 or it's usage in git-utils or it might be an issue in the way Atom is using git-utils.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Execute in a Windows console (Not Git Bash):\r\n```sh\r\ngit init test-repo && cd test-repo\r\necho. > test.txt && echo. > test2.txt\r\necho test.txt > .gitignore\r\necho test2.txt >> .git/info/exclude\r\n```\r\n2. Open `test-repo` in Atom with the default VCS exclude settings.\r\n3. Look at the tree view.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** test2.txt doesn't appear in the tree view or in fuzzy finder since it's ignored.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** test2.txt appears in the tree view as a new file and also appears in the fuzzy finder. But is ignored by standard Git (`git status`).\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.17.2\r\nElectron: 1.3.15\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n```\r\n```\r\napm  1.17.0\r\nnpm  3.10.5\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.13\r\ngit 2.13.0.windows.1\r\nvisual studio 2015\r\n```\r\nWindows 10.0.14393 x64\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14705","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14705/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14705/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14705/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14705","id":233130599,"number":14705,"title":"files with lots of lines hang the editor","user":{"login":"ChrisRiddell","id":2055566,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2055566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisRiddell","html_url":"https://github.com/ChrisRiddell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisRiddell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisRiddell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisRiddell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisRiddell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisRiddell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisRiddell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisRiddell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisRiddell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisRiddell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-06-02T09:44:43Z","updated_at":"2017-06-06T01:02:12Z","closed_at":"2017-06-06T01:02:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

Only allow editors in the workspace center.\r\n> - Change `atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor()` to return the active text editor (if any) in the workspace center. (This is more consistent with the pre 1.17.0 behavior described in https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14648#issuecomment-304381899.)\r\n> - Introduce `atom.workspace.observeActiveTextEditor()` as a means of observing the active text editor. (Packages like encoding-selector and grammar-selector _want_ to observe the active text editor, but currently have to rely on observing the active pane item, which is problematic for the reasons described in https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14648#issuecomment-304391943.)\r\n\r\nOnce this pull request is merged, I'll then be able to update each of the core packages that currently use `atom.workspace.observeActivePaneItem()` to instead use `atom.workspace.observeActiveTextEditor()` to receive notifications each time a different text editor becomes active. Once that's done, we'll be able to close #14648.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\n- For packages that need to observe the active text editor (e.g., https://github.com/atom/status-bar/issues/194), we could require those packages to observe all pane containers and watch for a text editor to become active in that pane container. Because observing the active text editor is a common need, I'd rather provide a core API for this functionality and not require each package to implement and maintain this logic.\r\n- Instead of disallowing editors in docks, we could teach `atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor()` to first check for an active text editor in the active pane container and return it if it exists, and to otherwise return the active text editor (if any) in the workspace center. `atom.workspace.observeActiveTextEditor()` would need to use similar logic to notify observers each time the value of `atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor()` changes. This approach would likely allow us to resolve https://github.com/atom/status-bar/issues/194, but it feels overly complicated, and it seems like something that is more likely to cause future confusion, surprise, and additional maintenance overhead.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nIt's the first step toward resolving #14648.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\n- Developers will have a core API for getting notified when:\r\n  - A text editor becomes the active text editor\r\n  - There is no longer an active text editor\r\n- The behavior of `atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor()` will [more closely match its pre-1.17.0 behavior](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14648#issuecomment-304381899), which various [packages relied on](https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace/pull/904).\r\n- We answer the question, \"Does it make sense to have an editor in a dock?\" Answer: No. Atom expects to find editors in the workspace center. Docks are intended to provide supporting tools like a tree view, a debugger, a console. xref: http://blog.atom.io/2017/05/23/docks-deep-dive.html\r\n- It reduces (hopefully 🤞) the overall number of scenarios that need to be considered in Atom core and in packages that interact with editors (e.g., https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace/issues/901#issuecomment-304078622).\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\n- By disallowing editors in docks, we reduce Atom's overall flexibility. If someone comes up with a compelling reason for using an editor in a dock, they're out of luck.\r\n- Implementing `getAllowedLocations()` on an item affects where the item opens when using `atom.workspace.open()` and when [dragging an item to a dock in the UI](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/16e1ef917be66637a58bad5e09c7d546782ee6e8/src/dock.js#L228-L229). However, functions like [`Pane::addItem()`](https://atom.io/docs/api/v1.17.2/Pane#instance-addItem) currently allow you to add the item to any location, regardless of the locations returned by the item's `getAllowedLocations()` function. In other words, there will continue to be ways to programmatically add a text editor to a dock, even though we're discouraging it and considering it to be unsupported behavior.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\n- #14648\r\n- https://github.com/atom/status-bar/issues/194\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] Add `TextEditor::getAllowedLocations()` to indicate that editors belong in the workspace center\r\n- [x] Add `Workspace::observeActiveTextEditor()`\r\n- [x] Add API docs for new functions in `Workspace`\r\n- [x] Determine and implement reasonable behavior for existing text editor functions in `Dock`:\r\n  - [x] [`observeTextEditors`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/16e1ef917be66637a58bad5e09c7d546782ee6e8/src/dock.js#L387-L400) -- 0b314ac1a98ca06c82fc369fffe4f13fc772abe5\r\n  - [x] [`getTextEditors`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/16e1ef917be66637a58bad5e09c7d546782ee6e8/src/dock.js#L586-L591) -- 09495dfc35b1294df0f4785e00d4eb1f8c7e27fc\r\n  - [x] [`getActiveTextEditor`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/16e1ef917be66637a58bad5e09c7d546782ee6e8/src/dock.js#L593-L600) -- f8ebd71200af4dcc5cf6fc2d85e68247833d9acc\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14695/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":3,"-1":1,"laugh":1,"hooray":1,"confused":1,"heart":1}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14694","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14694/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14694/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14694/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14694","id":232901196,"number":14694,"title":"Render line number gutter without numbers when showLineNumbers is false","user":{"login":"nathansobo","id":1789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo","html_url":"https://github.com/nathansobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-06-01T14:37:34Z","updated_at":"2017-06-02T02:01:47Z","closed_at":"2017-06-01T15:23:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/14694","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14694","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14694.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14694.patch"},"body":"In #13880 we honored the `lineNumberGutterVisible` parameter but neglected to honor the `showLineNumbers` parameter, which is what is used by the text editor registry to interact with the settings.
