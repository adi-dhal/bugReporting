Requirements\r\n\r\n* Filling out the template is required. Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.\r\n* All new code requires tests to ensure against regressions\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nCurrently the `--install` flag of the `./script/build` is a boolean flag that either installs atom to some predefined location or skips it. This PR extends the flag so it can accept a value telling the script where to install atom. Passing just `--install` will behave as it used to so far, so it will install atom to `/usr/local` on linux and other default locations on darwin and windows. Same with not passing the flag - atom won't be installed. But passing `--install=/opt/atom` will install atom under the given location.\r\n\r\nThe documentation is updated accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nI haven't considered other designs, extending the `--install` flag looked natural to me.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nIt's a part of the builder script, so it can't be a package.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nOne can install the code in the location of choice. (Like for flatpaks, we want to install atom under `/app`).\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nIt's backward compatible, so not sure if there are drawbacks.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nDidn't

PR addresses https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13873, where the core issue is that re-opening a project when you have a window open with no project folders simply adds those project folders to the existing window, but adding project folders does not restore state for that set of project folders\r\n\r\nThe primary bad UX that results from this is that re-opening a project from the \"Recent Projects\" menu when you have a fresh Atom window doesn't really restore the previous project state; it just adds those folders to the project and any unsaved work that's stored in the project state is lost, making the user a [sad panda](http://i.imgur.com/Ddd4lWp.jpg).\r\n\r\nThis addresses the problem by simply restoring the project state for a folder or set of folders when:\r\n\r\n1. The folders are added via \"Add Project Folders,\" or the folders are added automatically via the \"Open\" menu or via the `atom` command,\r\n2. The folders are being added to an Atom window in which there are zero project folders\r\n\r\nThis results in [happier pandas](http://i.imgur.com/xlgcLBy.gif).\r\n\r\n**Edge Cases**\r\n\r\n✅  The Atom window has no project folders but already contains pane items\r\n\r\nIn this case, we serialize all the current pane items, restore the saved state from the snapshot, and then re-add the serialized pane items to the new workspace. We skip unchanged, empty editors (ones with no changes and with no content, like the one you get when \"Open Empty Editor On Start\" is enabled), so in the case that the user opens a new window and immediately re-opens a previously open project, the right thing should Just Happen™. It's automagical! 🌈 \r\n\r\n![restore-project-state-with-open-items](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/189606/23728621/b0ad6402-0412-11e7-96f2-c4714c63ec9b.gif)\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Don't ask the user to save or discard the changes\r\n- [ ] Make the currently active pane item the active pane item after the state is restored (unless the user specifically opened a file, in which case that file will be active post-restore)\r\n\r\n❌  The Atom window has pane items that \"conflict\" with ones in the state snapshot\r\n\r\nIf the user already has a file open with unsaved changes, and that same file is open in the saved state snapshot, then the result of the operation is that there will be two copies of the file open, each backed by a different buffer.\r\n\r\nThis is super edge-casey as it's kinda hard to get into this state (since opening a file adds its parent folder to the project automatically), so I'm not sure if it's one we need to address. 💭 s appreciated.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [ ] ???\r\n\r\n❌  Using `project.setPaths` or `project.addPath` does not trigger this behavior\r\n\r\nRight now, the code paths for \"Application: Add Project Folder\" and for opening a file with the \"Open\" command or with `atom` go through code path that `project.setPaths` and `project.addPath` do not. We opted not to change that behavior since it would be a breaking change.\r\n\r\n**Design Considerations**\r\n\r\nIt turns out that serializing a text editor and then deserializing it into a new `AtomEnvironment` is not very straightforward. The sorta hacky solution implemented here so far is to:\r\n\r\n1. Serialize all the current pane items (text editors)\r\n2. Also serialize all the buffers in `@project.buffers`\r\n3. Restore the serialized `AtomEnvironment` state (minus window size and fullscreen setting)\r\n4. Push the serialized buffers from step 2 into the new `@project.buffers`\r\n5.

Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSo, I couldn't find a package which did this.\r\n\r\nEssentially, the `control + right/left arrow` (or `alt + right/left arrow` if you're on a Mac) allows you to go to the end or beginning of the word. I think that's well-known. However, for some reason, Atom works a bit differently.\r\n\r\nThis is what happens in Atom as you press the `alt + right arrow` shortcut in a line (the `|` is the cursor)\r\n\r\n    |if 20,000\r\n\r\n    if| 20,000\r\n\r\n    if 20|,000\r\n\r\n    if 20,|000\r\n\r\n    if 20,000|\r\n\r\nSo, as you can see, the cursor stops at the comma. However, this is much different to how it works in other apps. I tested it in Pages, TextEdit, Safari, as well as a bunch of other third-party apps, and they all work like this:\r\n\r\n    |if 20,000\r\n\r\n    if| 20,000\r\n\r\n    if 20,000|\r\n\r\nSimple and easy to use.\r\n\r\nSo, why do I want Atom to change its behavior to the second way instead of using its current method? Because it makes text editing and going to other places within a line *extremely annoying.* You *always* have to keep pressing `alt + right` to go somewhere, and sometimes this problem makes navigating as slow as having to press the right arrow key on its own, which is a real bummer.\r\n\r\nIs the comma the only character that causes this to happen? No, there is also `.` and `'`. One this about the single quote `'`. Additionally, there's another problem: `alt + backspace` (or `control + backspace`) also stops at these characters. That means that if you want to backspace the word `don't` in Atom, you need to press `alt + backspace` three times, whereas virtually in app other than Atom this shortcut only needs to be pressed once. You have the same problem with text selection via `alt + shift + arrow key` as well, making text editing in Atom a burden in general.\r\n\r\nThis is why I honestly think that this behavior should be changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nmacOS 10.12.3\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.13.1\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\napm  1.14.1\r\nnpm  3.10.5\r\nnode 4.4.5\r\npython

This pull request does so by:\r\n\r\n1. Exposing load settings to `BrowserWindow`s as JSON.\r\n\r\n    When accessing objects in the main process via the `remote` module, Electron returns proxy objects that are references to the original ones. This means that trying to access a remote object's property or function results in a synchronous message exchange with the main process. <br>\r\n\r\n    In Atom core we frequently access the load settings coming from the main process, especially during startup. This caused a lot of synchronous I/O which was blocking the renderer process for several milliseconds.\r\n  \r\n    With this pull request, instead of exposing load settings as a JavaScript object, we serialize them to JSON in the main process and parse them back to a JavaScript object in the renderer processes. This allows us to get a full copy of the object locally and pay for I/O only once when retrieving load settings from the main process for the first time.\r\n\r\n2. Disabling zoom in the main process rather than in the renderer process.\r\n\r\n    With this pull request we will register the `display-added` and `display-removed` events only once in the main process in order to disable zoom (see\r\n    #11345) directly instead of unnecessarily paying for I/O in the renderer process during startup.\r\n\r\n3. Registering enter/leave fullscreen events in the main process rather than in the renderer process.\r\n\r\n    This will still notify render processes when such events are triggered without, however, incurring the additional cost of synchronously retrieving a `BrowserWindow` (and its properties) via `remote` during startup.\r\n\r\n4. Replacing `localStorage` with `StateStore` in `HistoryManager`.\r\n\r\n    Instead of using `localStorage` to store and retrieve the project history, with this pull request we will use `StateStore` so that we can retrieve state asynchronously without blocking Atom during startup. @damieng: I think this slightly changes the public `clearProjects` API by making it asynchronous. Considering the recent introduction of the API and its low adoption (I couldn't find anyone using it in packages), I believe this might be negligible; if you have any concern about it, though, please don't hesitate to raise them up.\r\n\r\nThese improvements are particularly evident during the construction of an `AtomEnvironment` instance. This is how a typical chart of that code path looks like today on master:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-03-07 at 11 10 00](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/23651715/ae6bb898-0326-11e7-9059-22eb4bdd7f9a.png)\r\n\r\nAfter removing all the synchronous I/O, the same code path looks like the following:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-03-07 at 11 05 29](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/23651745/c4b1626a-0326-11e7-990e-cb9962520920.png)\r\n\r\nOn average, with these changes we save `~ 40ms` for the construction of `AtomEnvironment`. Moreover, the experience should be snappier across all the code paths because we won't pay any additional cost to retrieve load settings and to save project history state anymore. \r\n\r\nThe next step will involve building an `AtomEnvironment` instance right inside the snapshot (as opposed to doing so at runtime) and thus potentially save 80-90% of the remaining `~ 80ms` observed after the changes introduced by this pull request.\r\n\r\n/cc: @atom/maintainers ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13949/reactions","total_count":13,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":13}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13948","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13948/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13948/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13948/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13948","id":212371876,"number":13948,"title":"Project History not available in the menu when opening an empty new window","user":{"login":"mh-nichts","id":2863426,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2863426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mh-nichts","html_url":"https://github.com/mh-nichts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mh-nichts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mh-nichts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mh-nichts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mh-nichts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mh-nichts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mh-nichts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mh-nichts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mh-nichts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mh-nichts/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-03-07T09:14:03Z","updated_at":"2017-03-07T10:23:35Z","closed_at":"2017-03-07T09:25:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\r\n\r\nWhen opening a new window, with no folder or project in the tree view, the project history is not available in the menu File > Reopen Project.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

an option to *always* restore the last session, no matter how Atom is invoked (#9643).\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\n\r\n`src/config-schema.js`: the change adds the option to the Settings window.\r\n\r\n`src/main-process/atom-application.coffee`:\r\n- line 114: load previous session if the option is turned on;\r\n- line 563: IMO it's a bug, here the newly created window is activated, but `@lastFocusedWindow` is not updated, so on the second invocation at the same moment in time there'll be no lastFocusedWindow and a second (new) window would be created (at line 542/544 -> 550/552).\r\n- line 604: if any of the options is checked, restore the last session (applicable when starting atom without arguments)\r\n- line 817: a function to duplicate an object, taken from: https://coffeescript-cookbook.github.io/chapters/classes_and_objects/cloning\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nTL;DR: none, see the issue #9643 for an extended discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nThis is a standard behavior for most of modern multi-tab apps today, i.e. the ability to restore the last session after crash or normal exit, no matter how the app is invoked for the first time since the last session (i.e. with or without path parameters).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nSee the previous point.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nNone as this is an option turned off by default, so it won't affect anyone if not explicitly terned on by the user.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nSo far no issues were discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n###

Anyways, the traffic seems to be downloaded/streamed by Atom from the vm to the host.\r\n\r\nI attached some screenshots from the profiler (because the resulted files were so huge, I can upload them too, of course if needed) and one from tcptrack that tracked network traffic on the virtual machine.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"977\" alt=\"screenshot 2017-03-07 02 39 44\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/43100/23636724/c2b56886-02df-11e7-8bec-200f71ecf0b9.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"976\" alt=\"screenshot 2017-03-07 02 39 55\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/43100/23636729/c8e61606-02df-11e7-92c6-9acefa051855.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1137\" alt=\"screenshot 2017-03-07 01 46 41\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/43100/23636737/d60c5af2-02df-11e7-8d7e-4ea4168769a6.png\">\r\n\r\n( 192.168.1.155 is the vms ip in above)\r\n\r\nThere may also be some related issues here as the project tree view acts a bit weird, sometimes closing itself when saving, and the git-plus package is so slow with every operation (> 30s) that it's unusable.\r\n\r\nThis problem reproduces every time I open the project.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Mount filesystem over sshfs\r\n2. Open large git project folder with atom\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nmacOS 10.12.3\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.14.4\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\nSSHFS version 2.5

Requirements\r\n\r\n* Filling out the template is required. Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.\r\n* All new code requires tests to ensure against regressions\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nThis is one out of four parts necessary to move encoding auto-detection logic into core, the other three being https://github.com/atom/node-pathwatcher/pull/120, https://github.com/atom/text-buffer/pull/220, and https://github.com/atom/encoding-selector/pull/42.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this PR adds the option in the config schema to turn on encoding auto-detection and sets up the logic to detect the encoding whenever a file is opened.  It does _not_ actually do any detection (that is handled by PathWatcher).  The existing file encoding option is used as a fallback for when auto-detection fails.\r\n\r\nThis PR should be the third one to be merged, after https://github.com/atom/text-buffer/pull/220.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nThis design was based on how the existing `setEncoding` and `getEncoding` methods were implemented.  An alternate design would be to move the actual detection logic into atom/atom, though that feels unnecessary.  Furthermore, `detectEncoding` could be changed to `detectAndSetEncoding`, though I think some package authors may want to only detect the encoding.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nWe already offer the option to set a default encoding, but the ability to auto-detect the encoding is far more useful for people who regularly work with files with different encodings.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nThere will be no need to have to manually select the auto-detect option for each file.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nI can't think of any.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nCloses atom/encoding-selector#24\r\nSupersedes and closes #12127\r\n\r\nMany thanks to @tinymins for starting the implementation.  Most of my work was based off of his, though unfortunately I couldn't cherry-pick his commit over to my branch because his branch had been deleted.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13943/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13942","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13942/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13942/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13942/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13942","id":212194118,"number":13942,"title":"Combining unicode letter with another unicode letter does not work","user":{"login":"zsoerenm","id":375486,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/375486?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsoerenm","html_url":"https://github.com/zsoerenm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsoerenm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsoerenm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsoerenm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsoerenm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsoerenm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsoerenm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsoerenm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsoerenm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsoerenm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-03-06T17:31:06Z","updated_at":"2017-03-06T17:37:44Z","closed_at":"2017-03-06T17:37:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Normal letters like a - z can be combined with another unicode letter like tilde: ã\r\n\r\nBut others can not be combined as for example φ̃  \r\nThe tilde should be above phi, but it is displayed behind the phi.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13942/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13941","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13941/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13941/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13941/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13941","id":212186979,"number":13941,"title":"Update languages","user":{"login":"50Wliu","id":2766036,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2766036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu","html_url":"https://github.com/50Wliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-03-06T17:05:47Z","updated_at":"2017-03-06T20:21:41Z","closed_at":"2017-03-06T20:21:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/13941","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13941","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13941.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13941.patch"},"body":"### Requirements\r\n\r\n* Filling out the template is required.
