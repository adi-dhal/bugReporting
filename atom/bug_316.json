I recently upgraded to `atom-0.184.0` and the required `atom-shell-0.22.3`. All works remarkably well, considering how severe the one thing that does _not_ is:\n\nAlmost always (though strangely enough not really always) atom crashes whenever I try to copy something into its window. Not only that, but even if I have saved a file in a ~5s time window before the crash, it will undo whatever save that was :-/ This is not as far as I can tell contingent on what it is that I copy or where it is copied from.\n\nThis is seriously annoying! And sadly I can't seem to debug it , atom automatically detaches itself from the terminal so that I do not see any output... \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4836","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"CE82:2B9B:780C06:F49698:59D92BBB","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=317>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=315>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"1a5a76122a327c3fc6b164aa095570c7\"","status":"200 OK"}}
