I keep a dotfiles repo mainly because I have multiple computers. This makes the /storage dir create a mess for me. It makes ~/dotfiles constantly dirty for me, not to mention, I dont really want those things synced across computers.\n\nIt'd be nice to see that stuff actually get stored in `~/Library/Application Data/Atom` on OS X. This is where common application data goes, especially device specific things.\n\nA lot of the stuff inside `.atom` would be useful to sync across computers and in dotfiles. This includes app settings, plugins, etc. Environment things. \n\nIt seems to me that state like window size (per project) isn't something anyone would want. Not to mention how often it changes.\n\nI'd love to know if there is consideration being made about `.atom` and people putting it in their dot files. There is currently device specific things in there, as well as things you'd WANT to sync, like settings and plugins.

I only very rarely use split panes, and my main goal when I use global search is just to end up with another tab open in my current pane. When the search results open in a new pane, clicking on a result opens that file in the new pane next to the results, which means that in order to get back to my one-pane setup I now have to drag two tabs back into the original pane.\n\nI actually really liked how the old global search opened results in a drawer up from the bottom. I can handle opening results in a new tab instead, although I think I’d still prefer just a drawer connected to the search fields at the bottom. I can see how the new tab would be helpful so you can close the tab later if/when you need separately from navigating between other files, but going the extra step of creating a new pane for that tab just feels uneccessary and (in my use-case) counterproductive.
