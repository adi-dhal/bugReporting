so I'm sitting in Summit and blown the :shit: away by what you guys just showed. The funny thing is, after leaving Cloud9, I toyed with the idea of creating my own text editor with another friend.\n\nTangential to all that, I wrote my own Find-in-files/search-files module written in Node.js. It's heavily inspired by ack (which you're using) and ag. And it's fast as all hell: https://github.com/gjtorikian/nak (benchmarks available at the bottom) My ultimate goal was to be faster than ack, which I succeed by a large magnitude. \n\nThe tool is _so badass_ that it's also touted on the official ack page: http://betterthangrep.com/more-tools/\n\nAt Cloud9, I worked on the backend search implementation, and here's the (long-winded!) discussion on how I moved from ack (in Perl) to ag (in C) to nak (in Node.js): https://github.com/ajaxorg/cloud9/pull/2369\n\nIf this is something you're interested in using for 0.1, I'll make the PR for the
