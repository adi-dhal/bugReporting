What do you think? I am planning to use them in autocomplete-plus (a PR is on the way to that repo which will show how it'd work).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10610/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10609","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10609/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10609/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10609/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10609","id":129377458,"number":10609,"title":"Saving files in a safer way","user":{"login":"jiangyy","id":785251,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/785251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangyy","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangyy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangyy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangyy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangyy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangyy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangyy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangyy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangyy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangyy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangyy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-01-28T08:28:30Z","updated_at":"2016-01-28T19:39:08Z","closed_at":"2016-01-28T19:39:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"We have found that Atom is overwriting file using `fs.writeFileSync()` in both `TextBuffer::saveAs` and writing a configuration file. Note that `fs.writeFileSync()` opens a file with `O_TRUNC` flag. Imagine that there is a system crash in between, all data may be gone, leaving a blank file in the file-system. Our automated tool found this potential crash unsafety. This is particularly important when there is no backup file -- even if no backup file means less guarantee (the backup file treatment is correct).\n\nThe correct way to save a file: (1) write contents to a backup file; (2) rename the backup to the original file. The key is that (2) is ensured to be atomic by modern file-system implementations (like ext4). It is optional to add a fdatasync() between (1) and (2) in Linux, though I am not quite sure of behaviors under Windows.\n\nHere are some discussions FYI: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1812115/how-to-safely-write-to-a-file.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10609/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10608","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10608/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10608/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10608/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10608","id":129268494,"number":10608,"title":"Indent is not kept when inserting multiple line breaks","user":{"login":"abaracedo","id":9487675,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/9487675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaracedo","html_url":"https://github.com/abaracedo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaracedo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaracedo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaracedo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaracedo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaracedo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaracedo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaracedo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaracedo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaracedo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":171329633,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-reproduction","name":"needs-reproduction","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-01-27T21:07:24Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T21:09:33Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T21:09:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I noticed that when you make multiple break lines the indent is not kept in all the lines, only in the last one.\n\nI'm using the version 1.4.1 for Windows.

The second problem is that Atom sometimes crashed with samba shares. It seems that Atom has difficulty waiting for a response from Samba.

I edited lots and lots of files on Samba shares in 1.3.x and had no problems at all.\n\nA little bit more about the setup:\n\nOS X 10.10.5 running a Windows 7 SP1 VM in VMWare Fusion 7.  Some directories are shared from the Windows 7 VM using Windows file sharing.\n\nSteps:\n1.  Using Finder in OS X, mount a Samba share from the Windows VM.\n2.  Open Atom.\n3.  Open a file on the Samba share in Atom.\n4.  Edit the file, save, edit, save, etc.\n5.  Close the file in Atom.\n6.  Open another file, edit, save, edit, save, etc.\n7.  Close Atom.\n\nAt this point, everything seemed good.  Later, I attempted to edit the file opened in step 2 from within the Windows VM.  Reading the file worked, but it was locked for writing.\n\nI dismounted the Samba share to see if that closed the handle.\n\nIt did close the handle.  _It also entirely deleted the file I had been editing_.\n\nNow, there are several moving parts in the above scenario: Atom, OS X, Fusion, a Windows VM.  I can't guarantee that Atom is the part causing the data loss.  But I haven't seen files get locked like this, and only unlocked _and deleted_ when the share is unmounted (as in #10558, which is specifically about temp files) except in Atom >= 1.4.0.\n\n~~Let me know if I should merge this issue with #10558.~~  I merged that issue with this one - see comments below.\n\nEDIT: #10598 - \"Samba shares and Atom\" - which was closed as a dupe of this one - notes\n\n> The last problem is that changing words in a samba share can damage files. The word had to be changed is replaced with nothing.\n\nI'm not positive what that means, but it reminds me that I missed a step 8 above: In the Windows VM, rename the file opened in step 3.\n\nMaybe it does mean what I think it means, which also would seem to match my experience:\n\nif you edit a file on a Samba share in Atom, and then rename the same file via the OS that the Samba share resides on, then when the Samba share is dismounted the file is deleted completely.  Sometimes.  At least on OS X.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10595","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10595/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10595/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10595/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10595","id":128920704,"number":10595,"title":"Document
