For example, `window:decrease-font-size` has `cmd--` as one of its keybindings. The reason why this problem doesn't manifest currently is that [`window:decrease-font-size` has two keybindings currently](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/f1f8c3d0a72de7d20bcde4fd145261c34d3e7462/keymaps/darwin.cson#L79-L80), and the second one is getting picked when constructing the menu (the one which doesn't use `-`):\n\n```\n  'cmd--': 'window:decrease-font-size'\n  'cmd-_': 'window:decrease-font-size'\n```\n\nIf you remove that second keybinding, the menu entry for `Decrease font size` will not have a keystroke as well. 71fba99 fixes this by splitting the keystroke on `-`, but only if there's another character after it (so, it doesn't split on trailing `-`).\n\nI tried to figure out how to write tests for this, but failed. :disappointed: @kevinsawicki @maxbrunsfeld if you have some :hourglass: to point me in the right direction -- I'd be happy to add those. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6737/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6736","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6736/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6736/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6736/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6736","id":75192459,"number":6736,"title":"git repository packfiles kept open","user":{"login":"linquize","id":791115,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/791115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linquize","html_url":"https://github.com/linquize","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linquize/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linquize/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linquize/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linquize/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linquize/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linquize/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linquize/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linquize/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linquize/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":171329633,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-reproduction","name":"needs-reproduction","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-05-11T11:39:33Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T20:10:48Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T20:10:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Atom uses libgit2 to read git repository.\nHowever, if the repository has packfiles, the packfiles are kept open.\nThis makes `git gc` fail to delete the packfiles.\n\n```\n$ git gc\nCounting objects: 53635, done.\nDelta compression using up to 2 threads.\nCompressing objects: 100% (8149/8149), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (53635/53635), done.\nTotal 53635 (delta 30114), reused 53218 (delta 29697)\nUnlink of file '.git/objects/pack/pack-0edf695bcfc5349ac8940012a80521b3cba76437.pack' failed.

Is there a way to make the existing \"Open with Atom\" right-click menu entry \"stick\"? \nPlease tell me there's a more streamlined way to achieve correct file associations on Windows!\n\nExpected behaviour:\nEither Atom offers on installation to associate with files typically edited with a text editor, or offers a setting where you can do that post-installation. \nFailing that, the user is given a clear method of associating desired file types with Atom, e.g. using the \"open with\" dialog like other editors allow.\n\nObserved behaviour:\n1. Atom is not associated with any files, and there's no setting to change that. There is a context menu entry, but that requires constant right-clicking for every file you want to open in Atom, so is not really desirable.\n2. OK, so I thought I'd manually change the \"open With\" choice for every file type to a new default setting. (Right click a txt file - open with - set new default application) \n   Puzzlingly, Atom is not in the list of proposed applications. O_o\n3. Nevermind, let's hit \"further applications\" and select from there. Huh, Atom is not in C:\\Program Files, either, so that didn't work.\n4. OK, then let's select the installed desktop link (or start menu entry). Hooray, I could select it. Oh, it just flickers a terminal at you for a split second. Turns out, this just calls some update.exe, and something gets messed up (probably command args?).\n5. After some googling, I found out that Atom gets installed in AppData somewhere, so let's search the exe there. Erm, the exe is in a version-specific folder, so I'd have to re-associate all my file bindings after every update. No, thank you :-(\n6. the cmd file in the bin directory is an option, but to select that you have to\n   - go to the location in a separate Explorer window (to display hidden items to be able to see AppData, which you can't do in the file selection dialog)\n   - copy the path to bin\n   - navigate the open with dialog until you get to the point where you can select arbitrary files\n   - paste the path\n   - select atom.cmd\n7. Hooray, now I can open files with Atom all the time, but:\n   - I got no way to select the Atom icon, I got an empty white rectangle.\n   - It flickers the terminal for a split second, which interestingly does not happen when starting atom via the start menu. Annoying, but not vital.\n   - It says \"atom.cmd\" in the relevant dialogs/menus, which is not exactly beautiful/elegant.\n   - I can't imagine a normal user to go through this dance to do this, compared to the experience in other editors like Notepad++.\n\nVersions: Windows 8.1, Atom 198; dialog strings translated from German, so may not be identical to an english windows.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6734/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6733","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6733/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6733/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6733/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/6733","id":75141748,"number":6733,"title":"Render lines via tiles","user":{"login":"as-cii","id":482957,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/482957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii","html_url":"https://github.com/as-cii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":48,"created_at":"2015-05-11T08:50:00Z","updated_at":"2015-07-05T10:03:48Z","closed_at":"2015-06-02T22:18:42Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/6733","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/6733","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/6733.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/6733.patch"},"body":"This PR introduces a change in how we render lines. It does so by organizing them into tiles, which we then move up and down through a compositing transformation. The main advantage is that paint times dramatically reduce, because now we simply need to paint a small tile, instead of all the lines. This is especially noticeable during scrolling which, as a result, will be the subject of the benchmarks I am going to show later on.\n\nPlease, note that:\n- [x] Specs are broken. The solution you can see here was achieved by spiking a bunch of ideas, and therefore I didn't pay attention to change specs/code gradually. As a result, I plan to adapt previous specs and write some new ones as soon as possible.\n- [x] There's some evident structural duplication in code. However, I'd like to start refactoring that stuff as soon as I have unit tests to prevent naive errors.\n- [x] Naming-wise I am not entirely happy with `TilesPresenter` and `LinesPresenter` and they're probably going to change. Any suggestion or improvement is very welcome here.\n- I have intentionally left out line numbers from using this new approach. I'd like to keep this PR focused and work on that right after :ship:ping this one.\n\n:racehorse: And now some benchmarks! :racehorse:\n## Benchmarks\n\nTests conducted using:\n- A `1920x1080` window\n- `editor.scrollSensitivity = 130`\n- A custom code (associated to a keyboard key) to simulate `mouseWheel` events\n  \n  ``` coffee\n  document.querySelector(\"html /deep/ .editor-contents--private\").dispatchEvent(new WheelEvent(\"mousewheel\", wheelDeltaY: -250))\n  ```\n- Keyboard Key Repeat: `Fast` (Mac OS X setting)\n- Delay Until Repeat: `Short` (Mac OS X setting)\n\nI needed a (more or less) repeatable way to benchmark scrolling. To try this out, you can simply scroll up and down as you would normally do.\n### master\n\n![master](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/7561220/9eec5f12-f7ca-11e4-82ba-ac2124b536f0.png)\n### as-tiled-rendering\n\n![as-tiled-rendering](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/7561218/9a2fd81e-f7ca-11e4-8194-4075bc541ea3.png)\n### Why this matters?\n\nAs you can notice, paint times are dramatically reduced. This may not be noticeable with your :eyes:, but it's nevertheless important 'cause it leaves some room for additional operations (such as a more expensive character measurement computation). As said earlier, things are going to speed up further once we introduce tiling for line numbers as well.\n\nIt would be great if you could try this out, reporting any eventual regression or glitch that I may have overlooked while implementing the tiling strategy. Moreover, any code review or additional :eyes: are always welcome.\n\nThank you!\n\n/cc: @atom/feedback @nathansobo\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6733/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6732","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6732/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6732/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6732/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6732","id":75140792,"number":6732,"title":"Uncaught Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users/admin/Documents/workspace/coachcommune/components/web-site-app/WebSiteAppController.js'","user":{"login":"kpgarrod","id":2155409,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2155409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpgarrod","html_url":"https://github.com/kpgarrod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpgarrod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpgarrod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpgarrod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpgarrod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpgarrod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpgarrod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpgarrod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpgarrod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpgarrod/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-05-11T08:47:10Z","updated_at":"2015-05-11T11:54:10Z","closed_at":"2015-05-11T11:54:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[Enter steps to reproduce below:]\n1.
