feature I love of an increasing number of Mac OSX Lion and above apps is the auto-saving of untitled buffers.  If I quit an app that supports this behavior and re-open it, even untitled buffers (never explicitly named and saved) are restored. This lets me have greater confidence about using these apps as \"clipboards,\" knowing that even if I crash or accidentally close the app, I'll have some reasonably up-to-date copy of the file restored.\n\nSublime is the front-of-mind example for this in my daily workflow.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/942/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/941","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/941/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/941/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/941/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/941","id":20650219,"number":941,"title":"Use current window size for new window size","user":{"login":"kevinsawicki","id":671378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/671378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinsawicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2013-10-08T01:47:48Z","updated_at":"2014-06-22T12:15:40Z","closed_at":"2013-10-09T16:33:18Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/941","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/941","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/941.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/941.patch"},"body":"New windows now open at the same size as the current window and centered.\n\nThe default default size has also be increased from 800 x 600 to 1024 x the total screen height.\n\nFeedback welcome\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/941/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/940","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/940/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/940/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/940/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/940","id":20649529,"number":940,"title":"Partially render the gutter when possible","user":{"login":"benogle","id":69169,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/69169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle","html_url":"https://github.com/benogle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-10-08T01:19:19Z","updated_at":"2013-10-08T23:12:04Z","closed_at":"2013-10-08T23:10:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/940","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/940","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/940.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/940.patch"},"body":"The gutter rendering is the last piece in the editor rendering :racehorse: puzzle.

This was nice as it let us pull them out of submodules and gave us 150+ packages for all types of languages.\n\nThe more I think about it the more I think we actually want to have each of the bundles we ship with as a full-fledged repo until the atom org that we maintain, version, publish, etc.\n### Main Reasons\n- **Build community**: On day 1 of Atom launching if someone wants to fix a grammar bug or add a new snippet, we want them to do in a repo under the atom org. We don't want to tell them \"Go to the TextMate repo, update a plist, open a PR, and let us know when they accept it and we'll reconvert it and publish it\".\n- **TextMate bundles are not semantically versioned**: Well actually they aren't  really versioned at all, they aren't tagged, they don't have changelogs.  So when we rebuild them we have to go through the commit log, look for shady things, do some testing, and regressions still slip through.  We have no way of knowing when a bundle is \"ready\" for release and should be updated.\n- **atom/javascript-support**: As we level up snippets, grammars, commands, etc. over time we want to do it on our terms and we want it always to be under our org. as we evolve our language support in future versions.  We want people to star and watch these repos if they are interested in making language `X` better in Atom.\n### Proposal\n1. Create a repo for each TextMate bundle currently listed in the `package.json` file (currently 31) with the generated package.\n2. Delete out all folders/files for things we don't support so they are clean and consistent.\n3. Add a `README.md` to each repo explaining that they were originally generated from a TextMate bundle and that repo's location.\n4. Add a command to `bundle2package` that regenerates a TextMate bundle.  This would allow us to still pull in changes from the TextMate repos but always have diffs that are in JSON and that we selectively can commit or not ignore.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/925/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/924","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/924/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/924/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/924/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/924","id":20484848,"number":924,"title":"Use Travis CI for Atom packages","user":{"login":"mcolyer","id":1424,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1424?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer","html_url":"https://github.com/mcolyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2013-10-03T21:33:31Z","updated_at":"2014-04-29T17:21:02Z","closed_at":"2013-12-09T20:27:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We want to encourage development best practices for our 3rd party package authors.
