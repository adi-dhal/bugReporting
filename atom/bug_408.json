And i'm 100% sure that is Atom and not another soft, because when i use PhpStorm, it's never happened.\n![xdcc0sd](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8210023/4262196/7a885e5e-3b92-11e4-83ee-9c135f08d556.png)\n\nAnd in the console, i have nothing about that, only one error about the plugin AtomLinter when i start Atom :\n![0t8ihup](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8210023/4262199/e3063a8c-3b92-11e4-88a9-ea6f743d665e.png)\n\nConfiguration :\nAtom : 0.127.0\nWindows : 8.1\n\n(Sorry for my english, i'm french.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3532","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3532/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3532/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3532/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3532","id":42705911,"number":3532,"title":"Statistics","user":{"login":"ilanbiala","id":3695164,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3695164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilanbiala","html_url":"https://github.com/ilanbiala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilanbiala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilanbiala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilanbiala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilanbiala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilanbiala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilanbiala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilanbiala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilanbiala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilanbiala/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2014-09-13T21:17:44Z","updated_at":"2015-01-10T19:12:08Z","closed_at":"2015-01-10T19:12:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It would be awesome to know how many people are on each version, to know what minimum Atom version to require.

I am aware that packages might have problems and they need to be fixed (or disabled to stop the errors), but since I'm working on a project I don't have the time to do this. If things get critical I might debug and start disabling and debugging every single package installed, but if you keep popping that screen on my face every single time I'm gonna ditch Atom for a long time.\n\nSo, after my whining, I propose this:\nAt least there should be an option to disable it, probably accompanied by a warning like \"procceed at your own risk, if Atom starts to misbehave, follow the debugging procedure described here >link<\".\n\nPS: I searched through the issues and didn't find a similar request, only bugs that referenced this behavior. So, in case this is a duplicate, sorry.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3523","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3523/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3523/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3523/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3523","id":42598865,"number":3523,"title":"Editable defaults","user":{"login":"seth--","id":1149570,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1149570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seth--","html_url":"https://github.com/seth--","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seth--/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seth--/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seth--/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seth--/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seth--/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seth--/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seth--/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seth--/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seth--/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-09-12T05:56:10Z","updated_at":"2014-09-12T17:06:41Z","closed_at":"2014-09-12T17:06:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Just installed atom.
