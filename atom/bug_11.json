This is really annoying when I open new tabs and get jerked out of my element into fullscreen. Atom should not toggle fullscreen when opening a new tab, only a new window.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nFirst we set up the scenario:\r\n1. Navigate to ```Dock``` in the macOS System Preferences\r\n2. Change ```Prefer tabs when opening documents:``` to ```Always```\r\n3. Open up atom to a directory\r\n4. File->Open another directory (You should now have 2 native tabs in the same window)\r\n5. Enter the macOS native fullscreen mode\r\n6. Close one of the native tabs [Taking note of that path] (So only one project is left open now)\r\n7. Exit native fullscreen\r\n8. Quit Atom\r\n\r\nNow we can reproduce the bug:\r\n1. Open up atom to the directory that was last open (Atom should open and NOT enter fullscreen)\r\n2. Now File->Open the path you took note of in step 6\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\nThe new native tab should open and the app should not enter native fullscreen.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\nThe app enters native fullscreen.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\n100% of the time\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom: 1.17.2\r\nMacOS:

I previously had it working, then one day it just started acting very strange, and wouldn't boot up. I tried to uninstall, but get this:\r\n\r\n`cannot find 'C:\\Users\\myusername\\AppData\\Local\\atom\\Update.exe' `\r\n\r\nAtom is still visible in my control panel installed apps, but is definitely not installed on my computer, as I manually tried to delete its files. Running the newest installer pretty much freezes some parts of my computer. In fact, I need to reboot right now because the Atom installer just crashed Windows explorer.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Clicking on installation .exe\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** For Atom installer to work.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** A spinner appears and never boots up. I also, can't find anything in the taskmanager to end the process so the spinner stops.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100% of the time.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nLatest Windows 64 Bit installer. I am running Windows 10, with the latest updates.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nHelp. I am forced to use Visual Studio, which feels like something my World War 2 Veteran grandfather would use if he was still alive. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15529/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15528","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15528/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15528/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15528/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15528","id":254800242,"number":15528,"title":"Don't remeasure invalid block decorations","user":{"login":"as-cii","id":482957,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/482957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii","html_url":"https://github.com/as-cii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-09-02T09:12:02Z","updated_at":"2017-09-03T18:40:32Z","closed_at":"2017-09-02T09:41:59Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/15528","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15528","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15528.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15528.patch"},"body":"This fixes an uncaught exception that was being thrown after invalidating a marker and resizing the editor.

Also worth noting, I can open a file in Atom from the File menu once Atom is open.\r\n\r\nThe first time I had this problem today, Atom was 1.19.3, I updated and the problem persisted.\r\n\r\nI have attached my console errors.\r\n\r\nUncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read property 'onWillSave' of undefined\r\n    at Project.module.exports.Project.subscribeToBuffer (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/project.js:560:19)\r\n    at /Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/project.js:133:25\r\n\r\nUncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read property 'isRetained' of undefined\r\n    at /Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/project.js:149:27\r\n    at Array.map (native)\r\n    at Project.module.exports.Project.serialize (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/project.js:147:47)\r\n    at AtomEnvironment.module.exports.AtomEnvironment.serialize (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/atom-environment.js:876:37)\r\n    at /Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/atom-environment.js:1209:33\r\n    at AtomEnvironment.module.exports.AtomEnvironment.saveState (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/atom-environment.js:1205:20)\r\n    at /Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/atom-environment.js:373:34","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15520/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15519","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15519/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15519/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15519/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15519","id":254355703,"number":15519,"title":"[broken items] No icon, github status in settings, packages","user":{"login":"cchang62","id":15147139,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15147139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchang62","html_url":"https://github.com/cchang62","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchang62/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchang62/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchang62/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchang62/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchang62/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchang62/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchang62/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchang62/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchang62/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-08-31T14:32:45Z","updated_at":"2017-08-31T18:53:28Z","closed_at":"2017-08-31T18:53:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

Proxy has been set up and installing new packages externally via apm is successful. Also, accessing projects on github or npm servers from my ubuntu are not problem. However, Atom editor can not show images or some status somehow, in the picture illustrated below.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I also installed Atom editor on the host, window 7 enterprise edition, of VirtualBox. The editor shows everything correctly in the same condition of setting proxy. How can I debug the broken images?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nOS\r\nVirtualBox:  5.1.26 r117224 (Qt5.6.2)\r\nDescription:\tUbuntu 16.04.2 LTS\r\nRelease:\t16.04\r\nCodename:\txenial\r\n\r\nAtom\r\napm

I want to search for ocurrences of the portion in bold within my project\r\n ```\r\n<table id=\"tablaAlbaranes\" class=\"table datatable-column-search-inputs-custom\">\r\n                            <thead>\r\n                                <tr>\r\n                                    <th style=\"width: 50px; visibility:hidden;\">Selector</th>**\r\n                                    <th>asdf</th>\r\n                                    <th>asdf</th>\r\n```\r\n2. Therefore I search (either in entire project/solution, or in single file) with the following regex expression \\<table(.*\\s*\\n*)*?\\<t ... \r\n\r\n3. When I get to this point, Atom stops working and I am forced to reset.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** I would expect Atom to halt the execution of a match in case it detected a catastrophic backtracking, should there be one.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Atom stops working and does not recover.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100% every time I use a complex search term as \\<table(.*\\s*\\n*)*?\\<th.*\\>.*\\<\\/th\\>\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nWindows 10 x64 v1607\r\nAtom: 1.19.4\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome: 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode: 7.4.0\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nAny additional information, configuration or data that might be necessary to reproduce the issue.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15513/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15512","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15512/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15512/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15512/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15512","id":254236758,"number":15512,"title":"Upgrade 1.19.3 to 1.19.4 stuck in loop","user":{"login":"lacostenycoder","id":6077905,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6077905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lacostenycoder","html_url":"https://github.com/lacostenycoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lacostenycoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lacostenycoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lacostenycoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lacostenycoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lacostenycoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lacostenycoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lacostenycoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lacostenycoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lacostenycoder/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-08-31T07:10:11Z","updated_at":"2017-08-31T07:14:42Z","closed_at":"2017-08-31T07:14:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

Wire up the focus handler unconditionally\r\n- Add new `core.gitRepositoryRefreshOnWindowFocus` setting\r\n- Check `core.gitRepositoryRefreshOnWindowFocus` in focus handler\r\n- Remove `refreshOnWindowFocus` param since it was unused\r\n- Document the `project` and `config` params\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nIf the user has one or more projects in the tree view with Git repositories, Atom freezes for a few seconds each time the window gains focus. The editor spends this time re-indexing Git data for all of those projects in the foreground. This makes Atom feel sluggish and unresponsive, and disrupts work flow when the user is likely to be ready to blaze ahead with an active task.\r\n\r\nSee #9544 for full discussion of the issue.\r\n\r\nAfter this change, the default behavior is to no longer do this re-indexing work on window focus. A new settings checkbox can be used to enable the old behavior:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1559108/29900065-d6f52a24-8db4-11e7-9b7b-398a5d375f8b.png)\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nThe old code had an unused Boolean parameter controlling whether the focus handler would be wired up. We could have passed the new setting as the value of that parameter. I decided that wasn't desirable because the changes could not take effect immediately when the user changed the setting. To respond to user setting changes on the fly, we need to wire up the event unconditionally and check the setting's current value when it fires. Since the old parameter would conflict with the new setting, it is removed.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nFixes an issue with Core.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\n- Improved responsiveness when multitasking Atom with other applications\r\n- Multiple users on #9544 reported quitting Atom or almost quitting due to this issue, so possible improvement in user outreach and retention\r\n- Multiple users on #9544 resorted to risky workarounds (deleting or renaming a project's .git folder, deactivating core packages, avoiding the use of project folders), so possible improvement in general stability if those workarounds are no longer needed\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nThe old code does not document why this behavior existed, so we do not know the exact rationale for it or what might be lost by removing it. I speculate that it is to account for the possibility that the user might make changes affecting one of Atom's currently open Git repositories in an external application, which would then need to be reflected in Atom. However, this behavior imposes a serious usability penalty for all Git users, and users who do not need it have no recourse to eliminate this penalty. Furthermore, it is not a robust solution to that potential problem, as it is possible to modify a Git repo without switching focus away from Atom (for example, via a scheduled task or a remote login from another computer).\r\n\r\nTo mitigate the possibility of new issues, the problematic code is not simply removed. Rather, a setting is created so that users who need the old behavior and are willing to tolerate its drawbacks can enable it with a checkbox in the Core settings.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\n- Fixes #9544 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15510/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15509","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15509/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15509/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15509/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15509","id":254146702,"number":15509,"title":"Add signing for linux installer","user":{"login":"ungb","id":5624870,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5624870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb","html_url":"https://github.com/ungb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ungb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-08-30T21:51:00Z","updated_at":"2017-10-03T19:58:48Z","closed_at":"2017-10-03T19:58:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?
