When moving the mouse into the editor portion of ATOM it completely disappears, if you type some text into the editor and try to move the mouse over the text it is still visible, just black. Once you move the cursor up to the tabs, it shows up again as a white pointer. Is it possible to fix this?\n\nWindows 8.1\nRDP 7\nATOM - .184.0\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5798","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5798/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5798/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5798/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5798","id":59353295,"number":5798,"title":"Disorganised files relating to numbered file names regardless of windows folder organisation.","user":{"login":"Schnarfengargle123","id":11248167,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/11248167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Schnarfengargle123","html_url":"https://github.com/Schnarfengargle123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Schnarfengargle123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Schnarfengargle123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Schnarfengargle123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Schnarfengargle123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Schnarfengargle123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Schnarfengargle123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Schnarfengargle123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Schnarfengargle123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Schnarfengargle123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-02-28T19:00:20Z","updated_at":"2015-02-28T19:28:14Z","closed_at":"2015-02-28T19:28:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The folder display on the left hand side of atom has a bug where files are not displayed properly in order of name.
