recent update to 1.15.0, I noticed multi-line editing is broken when Adding selections (above or below) or Splitting into Lines when the line is longer than 500 characters and continues onto the next line (\"soft-wrapped\" line?). Forgive me if I am missing something simple here; I would love to hear suggestions if this is a configuration problem on my part.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Have a line of text that surpasses 500 characters, and is thus wrapped on the following line (with a dot as the line number)\r\n2. Use Add Selection (above or below) to add a soft-wrapped line\r\n3. Use Split into Lines to add a soft-wrapped line\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** \r\n\r\n\"Split into lines\" will split into the logical \"start\" of each line, regardless of soft-wrapping.\r\n\r\n\"Add selection (above or below)\" will use the logical \"start\" of each line, regardless of woft-wrapping.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** \r\n\r\n\"Split into lines\" seems to ignore the logical \"start\" of soft-wrapped lines and treats the continued line as the actual line of text to which the cursor is distributed (see animated gif). \r\n\r\n\"Add selection (above or below)\" uses the correct logical \"start\" of the next soft-wrapped line IN ADDITION TO the \"start\" (NOT A REAL LINE START!!!) of the continued line, which is incorrect because, after all, this is just one big \"logical line\", except it has been \"virtually\" split at the 500 char mark (see animated gif)\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** All 500+ character soft-wrapped lines are affected, I beleive\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nOSX 10.10.5\r\n$ apm --version\r\napm  1.15.3\r\nnpm  3.10.5\r\nnode 4.4.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.12\r\ngit 2.5.4\r\n$ atom --version\r\nAtom    : 1.15.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI use Atom only for Python, so not sure if this applies to other languages, etc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14011","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14011/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14011/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14011/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14011","id":214546101,"number":14011,"title":"Atom Autocomplete + Emmet Tab issue","user":{"login":"ModernWebService","id":24275844,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/24275844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ModernWebService","html_url":"https://github.com/ModernWebService","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ModernWebService/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ModernWebService/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ModernWebService/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ModernWebService/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ModernWebService/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ModernWebService/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ModernWebService/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ModernWebService/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ModernWebService/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":175213356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/question","name":"question","color":"ededed","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-03-15T22:31:54Z","updated_at":"2017-03-23T20:51:05Z","closed_at":"2017-03-23T20:50:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I currently have Atom installed same configuration on a Lenovo Edge 15 with Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.04 and a 2015 Macbook Pro OSX 10.12.3.

to https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3429#issuecomment-286594653\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI have downloaded atom. Installed it. Opened up a project and the `.gitignore` is not being detected and the Tree View is not changing (reducing the opacity of the folder).\r\n\r\nIt used to do this in the past. I have tried several projects and all do not work. These projects all work in other applications/IDE so I do not believe it's a project issue. I feel like I'm doing something really silly..\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Have a fresh install of Atom with no setting changes\r\n2. Set `tree-view.hideVcsIgnoredFiles` to `true`\r\n3. Create a new directory `~/test`\r\n3. Change to the `~/test` directory\r\n3. Execute `git init` within `~/test`\r\n3. Open Atom with the command `atom ~/test`\r\n3. Create a folder named `should-be-ignored`\r\n4. Create a `.gitignore` file\r\n4. Add a line containing `should-be-ignored` to the `.gitignore` file\r\n\r\n**Expected:** Folder named `should-be-ignored` to disappear\r\n\r\n**Actual:** Folder named `should-be-ignored` remains and does not change color\r\n\r\n### Original Repro Steps\r\n\r\n1. Have a fresh install of Atom with no setting changes\r\n2. Enable the VCS settings\r\n3. Create a folder, name it eg: `should-be-ignored`\r\n4. Create a .gitignore, add that folder to it\r\n5. Nothing changes\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** I expect it to tint/opacity change the folder in the Tree view so it's visibly different.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Nothing happens, no visual que.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n- Windows 10, 64bit\r\n- Downloaded Latest atom from https://atom.io/\r\n    - Atom 1.15.0\r\n    - Atom Beta 1.16.0 also doesn't work\r\n\r\nNo plugins.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/sFu4nhx.png)\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/vvOg6jH.png)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14006/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14005","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14005/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14005/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14005/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14005","id":214224740,"number":14005,"title":"Passing {activateItem: false} to Workspace::open causes the item not to be added to the Pane","user":{"login":"BinaryMuse","id":189606,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/189606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse","html_url":"https://github.com/BinaryMuse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinaryMuse/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":505038679,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-03-14T22:23:37Z","updated_at":"2017-03-14T22:23:37Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n`atom.workspace.open` takes a parameter called `activateItem`, described as:\r\n\r\n> A Boolean indicating whether to call `Pane::activateItem` on containing pane.

V1.15.0-beta3 [fixed a bug that was causing the paste](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5411#issuecomment-280845675) of a large amount of characters to crash the app. This was awesome but this version also started causing lines outside of the window to wrap after they reached a certain amount of characters. So I'm guessing that there is probably a trade off — no crash on large paste = limited amount of characters per line.\r\n\r\nIs this a bug, or is this just the way Atom works now? Is it possible to increase the amount of characters allowed per line?\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n1.16.0-beta0","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14002/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14001","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14001/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14001/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14001/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14001","id":214023512,"number":14001,"title":"Uncaught Error: tunneling socket could not be established, cause=write ECONNRESET","user":{"login":"Andrew-Webb","id":3470891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3470891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrew-Webb","html_url":"https://github.com/Andrew-Webb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrew-Webb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrew-Webb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrew-Webb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrew-Webb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrew-Webb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrew-Webb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrew-Webb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrew-Webb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrew-Webb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-03-14T10:11:57Z","updated_at":"2017-03-14T22:07:51Z","closed_at":"2017-03-14T22:07:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[Enter steps to reproduce:]\r\n\r\n1. ...
