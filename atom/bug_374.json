It would be nice to make the API more coherent considering the expanded role of settings.\n- We're using a private method, `::addScopedSettings` in packages. We need a public equivalent. The main difference is that `::addScopedSettings` takes a `source` argument. The `source` is used to distinguish between user settings and package settings internally, so it's important.\n- Methods related to defaults don't make sense in the presence of scoped settings. The methods `::isDefault`, `::restoreDefault`, and `::getDefault` don't actually deal with true _default_ values from the schemas. Instead they consider a value \"default\" if its source isn't the user's `config.cson`\n### Proposed Solution\n\nWe can eliminate `::addScopedSettings` and the methods that deal with defaults from the API. Instead, we replace them with the ability to talk about the _source_ of a given setting when getting and setting it. Then the settings view can make decisions based on the source being the user's `config.cson`, rather than exposing a murky conception of \"default\" in settings.\n\nWe propose to replace the following methods:\n- getDefault\n- isDefault\n- restoreDefault\n- addScopedSettings\n\nWith these new signatures for get and set\n- set(keyPath, value, [{scopeSelector, source}])\n- get(keyPath, [{scope, sources, excludeSources}])\n\nPlus the new `unset` method... which can be used to remove a single key path or all key paths from a given scope.\n- unset([keyPath], [{source}])\n\nIf we need to know if a value is assigned in the user's settings, we specify the desired _source_ in our getter.

Deprecate `is/get/restoreDefault` methods and replace with `get` and `set` plus `source` options\n\nPreviously, the private method `::addScopedSettings` was used to associate config settings with a source other than the user's config file. It bypassed schema validation.\n\nThis is being driven out by changes made in atom/snippets#86; to fix deprecation warnings required calling private methods on

I am using also the `vim-mode` package, I don't know if it is related.\n### Stack Trace\n\n```\nAt /opt/atom/resources/app/node_modules/text-buffer/lib/history.js:124\n\nTypeError: Cannot read property 'getBufferPosition' of undefined\n  at TextEditor.module.exports.TextEditor.getCursorBufferPosition (/opt/atom/resources/app/src/text-editor.js:1300:34)\n  at BracketMatcher.module.exports.BracketMatcher.insertText (/opt/atom/resources/app/node_modules/bracket-matcher/lib/bracket-matcher.js:82:42)\n  at TextEditor.<anonymous> (/opt/atom/resources/app/node_modules/bracket-matcher/lib/bracket-matcher.js:3:61)\n  at TextEditor.object.(anonymous function) [as insertText] (/opt/atom/resources/app/node_modules/underscore-plus/lib/underscore-plus.js:69:20)\n  at /opt/atom/resources/app/src/text-editor-component.js:653:23\n  at History.module.exports.History.transact (/opt/atom/resources/app/node_modules/text-buffer/lib/history.js:115:18)\n  at TextBuffer.module.exports.TextBuffer.transact (/opt/atom/resources/app/node_modules/text-buffer/lib/text-buffer.js:683:27)\n  at TextEditor.module.exports.TextEditor.transact (/opt/atom/resources/app/src/text-editor.js:1146:26)\n  at [object Object].module.exports.React.createClass.onTextInput (/opt/atom/resources/app/src/text-editor-component.js:652:30)\n  at HTMLDivElement.boundMethod (/opt/atom/resources/app/node_modules/react-atom-fork/lib/ReactCompositeComponent.js:1295:21)\n\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4546/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4778","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"EBE1:366E:70A300:ED4B64:59D92C83","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=375>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=373>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"d63df01efeb6a66c1cf726ec4baab78c\"","status":"200 OK"}}
