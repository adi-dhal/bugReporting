With those improvements, storing DOM elements in an object pool does not provide the same performance benefits that it once did. This PR removes the `DOMElementPool` and replaces its usages with simple calls to `document.createElement` and `HTMLElement.remove`.\r\n\r\n#### Results\r\n\r\nI compared the experiences of scrolling for 4 seconds straight in a large file with syntax highlighting (`text-editor-component-spec.js`) before and after removing the element pool. I could discern a difference in the average frame rate or its variance from the timelines.\r\n\r\nLooking at the statistics though, it looks like the CPU stays idle for a slightly higher percent of the time **with** the `DOMElementPool`. And as you would expect, the memory usage is slightly more stable with the pool.\r\n\r\n**With element pool**\r\n\r\n![before](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/326587/23038221/176df5a6-f43e-11e6-9388-f07ba1ef1f77.png)\r\n\r\n**Without element pool**\r\n\r\n![after](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/326587/23038229/1e8ccf9c-f43e-11e6-9a7d-e498bc24ca5c.png)\r\n\r\n#### Conclusion\r\n\r\nOverall, the pool does improve performance very slightly (maybe imperceptibly).\r\n\r\n@nathansobo @as-cii @kuychaco In a way, the element pool is still a good idea, but if we keep it, we need to understand that bug that we saw in the line number rendering.

We force soft wraps for lines that exceed 500 chars. This avoids the rendering bottleneck that we used to experience because we don't break lines into horizontal tiles. It's actually a pretty useful behavior, I think, because a single un-wrapped line of code is pretty hard to read.\r\n\r\n2. We don't pass more than 500 chars at a time to first-mate. There was already a limit to the number of tokens that we read from first-mate, but because the TextMate grammars can contain regexps with arbitrary lookahead and backtracking requirements, this token limit did not mitigate all of the performance problems of tokenizing large lines. Now we avoid passing more than 500 characters of text at a time to the tokenizer.\r\n\r\n#### Benchmark results\r\n\r\nWe added a benchmark for opening large single-line files. When run agains Atom *prior* to this PR, this benchmark would basically not terminate 😬 . Now, it executes in a reasonable amount of time:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOpening a large single-line file:\r\n512\t1442.5700000000002\r\n1024\t2813.6100000000006\r\n2048\t5145.779999999995\r\n\r\nMax time event loop was blocked after opening a large single-line file:\r\n512\t14.859999999999673\r\n1024\t8.095000000001164\r\n2048\t5.575000000004366\r\n\r\nClicking the editor after opening a large single-line file:\r\n512\t6.609999999999673\r\n1024\t3.9499999999970896\r\n2048\t4.955000000001746\r\n\r\nScrolling down after opening a large single-line file:\r\n512\t0.18499999999949068\r\n1024\t0.05000000000291038\r\n2048\t0.05000000000291038\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see that the editor is immediately responsive after opening the file, regardless of its size. Unfortunately, the time to open a large single-line file still scales linearly with the size of the file. This is because the `DisplayLayer` currently indexes files on a line-wise basis, so for a single-line file, it has to index the entire file to answer any queries.\r\n\r\nStill, a reasonably-sized minified file like [jQuery 3.1.1](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.min.js) (85 kb, 4 lines), opens almost instantly 🎉 .\r\n\r\n\r\n/cc @ungb Can you give this a test, and link to any relevant issues about hangs when opening files with long lines?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13820/reactions","total_count":31,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":21,"confused":0,"heart":9}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13819","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13819/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13819/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13819/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13819","id":207658423,"number":13819,"title":"Fix Arch Linux package names","user":{"login":"quark-zju","id":445459,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/445459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark-zju","html_url":"https://github.com/quark-zju","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark-zju/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark-zju/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark-zju/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark-zju/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark-zju/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark-zju/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark-zju/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark-zju/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quark-zju/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722972,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-testing","name":"needs-testing","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-02-14T22:42:05Z","updated_at":"2017-10-02T21:02:02Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/13819","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13819","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13819.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13819.patch"},"body":"Arch Linux does not have `devel` packages.
