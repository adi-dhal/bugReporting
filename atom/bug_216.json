Panes, tabs, editor, tree view, etc...\ncore: the _thing_ that does file management (open/close/save files), holds unsaved buffers, performs searching in the FS, etc.\n\nIn other words, The UI would be the `V` and the `C` and the core would be the `M` if I had to describe that thing with a `MVC` example.\n\nSuch a split would allow Atom to:\n- edit files remotely (like vim/emacs over ssh)\n- connect to another Atom core and interact with it (collaborative editing between 2+ people)\n- speed up Atom (tricky, First launch won't have any speed boost, but multiple instances won't need to do the entire startup process, but only search for an already available core and bind to it)\n- make Atom's UI bullet proof (an UI crash, which is still a thing, won't close opened files nor lose unsaved buffers, as those would be living in the core instead of the UI)\n- probably more\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9334/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9333","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9333/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9333/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9333/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9333","id":114053278,"number":9333,"title":"Add section on reporting bugs to contributing guide","user":{"login":"izuzak","id":38924,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/38924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak","html_url":"https://github.com/izuzak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":193722948,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-review","name":"needs-review","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-10-29T13:50:13Z","updated_at":"2015-11-08T21:16:53Z","closed_at":"2015-11-08T21:13:09Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/9333","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9333","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9333.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9333.patch"},"body":"This adds a section on reporting bugs to the contributing guide and removes the generic section on submitting issues. My plan is to add a section on submitting feature requests and sections on other types of \"issues\" and pull requests, so that we cover all the different types of contributions. I think that will be more helpful than a single generic section since it will allow us to provide specific advice for each type of contribution, and I also think users will find the right section easier.\n\nThe section on submitting bug reports is structured in three parts: what you should do before submitting a bug report, which information you should provide in a bug report, and a template for structuring the information. For the part on which information should be provided, I tried to structure this as a list, and bold key sections off each note so that it's easy to scan. I think it will be helpful to list all the questions we often ask when debugging issues -- sometimes that will help users figure out things on their own and provide more helpful reports, and it will allow maintainers to link to this section and say \"Please provide more information, as listed here\". \n\n@atom/feedback @atom/issue-triage As always, I'd appreciate your feedback. :honey_pot: Is there any other information we normally ask from users when debugging issues? How do you like the idea of providing a template here, and should some other questions/information be a part of it? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9333/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9332","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9332/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9332/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9332/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9332","id":114050514,"number":9332,"title":"GitHub Markdown syntax highlighting bug for bash codeblocks","user":{"login":"emil-nasso","id":1119706,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1119706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emil-nasso","html_url":"https://github.com/emil-nasso","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emil-nasso/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emil-nasso/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emil-nasso/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emil-nasso/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emil-nasso/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emil-nasso/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emil-nasso/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emil-nasso/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emil-nasso/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":163641905,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/atom","name":"atom","color":"f7c6c7","default":false},{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2015-10-29T13:36:16Z","updated_at":"2017-06-30T23:17:59Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"It seems like the syntax highlighting for bash code blocks \"leaks out\" when using the `GitHub Markdown` syntax highlighting.\n\nSeems to be triggered by the keyword `if`.\n\n![https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/u3nhh3tiffs6spc/2015-10-29%20at%2014.33.png?dl=0](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/u3nhh3tiffs6spc/2015-10-29%20at%2014.33.png?dl=0)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9331","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9331/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9331/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9331/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9331","id":114032862,"number":9331,"title":"(ctrl + backspace) or (ctrl + del) unexpected behaviour","user":{"login":"prog666","id":6894885,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6894885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prog666","html_url":"https://github.com/prog666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prog666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prog666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prog666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prog666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prog666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prog666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prog666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prog666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prog666/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-10-29T11:44:31Z","updated_at":"2015-10-29T13:03:32Z","closed_at":"2015-10-29T12:58:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"in this case\n\n``` javascript\ncontainer.hover(func, /*cursor here*/                              func2);\n```\n\nwhen I hit (ctrl + del) I expect it to delete all spaces before 'func2', but I get 'func2' deleted too.

If I right click and choose to open in the new window, it'll open a new instance of Atom with the selected file displaying and proper Tree View on the left.\n\nNote that this only occurs if you are doing this with existing files.

used the command `atom .` to open the root level of a large SVN-controlled project. Atom takes a fairly long time to open this, and is laggy while trying to scroll through/open directories using the file explorer. In addition, opening a large file (say, an 1800 line shell script) takes longer than it should. Further, if I open the large file, then switch to Chrome, then switch back, the editor often freezes forcing me to wait several seconds before giving me the ability to scroll/edit again; often it simply crashes the editor.\n\nIs this a known bug/being addressed at all?

PR speeds up source code compile times by using a hacked version of the `vm` module (https://github.com/as-cii/cached-run-in-this-context).\n\nWe've been searching very hard for a way to make startup faster: the biggest low hanging fruit seemed to be `vm.runInThisContext` which, before this improvement, took more than `250ms-300ms`. That function is used inside `Module.prototype._compile` for, surprise, compiling the source code: although v8 compiler is quite fast already, our codebase has grown quite a lot and the more files we added, the worse the situation would get.\n\nThe snapshot approach tried in #9265 should have indirectly solved this, but it felt way too complicated to construct an `AtomEnvironment` inside the snapshot context. Instead, we are taking advantage of a v8 compiler feature that allows to speed up source code compilation by producing/consuming a cache blob. By using this mechanism, we have managed to change startup times from (without any tab open):\n\n![screen shot 2015-10-28 at 11 51 42](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/10786490/c2df5476-7d6a-11e5-8f77-e089911f33f8.png)\n\nto:\n\n![screen shot 2015-10-28 at 11 48 05](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/10786493/c6248cfa-7d6a-11e5-85eb-b2e2563aec6f.png)\n\n:tada: :tada: :tada:\n\nThere's still some aspect we could improve, such as where these cache blobs get stored: I used files as the storage mechanism, as it allows us to keep the code pretty simple, but they take ~40ms to get read. There are alternatives to this (e.g. asar), but I am not sure it would improve the situation that much: even a 50% improvement, would make this just ~20ms faster at the expense of making code a bit more complex.\n\nPlease, note that whenever DevTools are open, v8 seems to make this optimization a bit worse: if you, however, spawn Atom:\n- via cmd;\n- by running the executable;\n- by reloading the window with DevTools closed;\n\nYou will notice the speedup. @zcbenz: any ideas why this happens? I guess this covers already 100% of the average use cases and won't matter to the end user, but if possible it seems to be still worth investigating.\n\nAfter this lands, I will go on hunting other things that are slowing startup down: we feel like IO could be the main cause but we'll get a better picture after this improvement gets :ship:ped.\n\n/cc: @atom/feedback @nathansobo \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9317","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9317/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9317/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9317/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9317","id":113778418,"number":9317,"title":"Build Atom failed in OS X","user":{"login":"xysDavid","id":2630813,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2630813?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xysDavid","html_url":"https://github.com/xysDavid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xysDavid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xysDavid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xysDavid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xysDavid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xysDavid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xysDavid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xysDavid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xysDavid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xysDavid/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-10-28T09:38:53Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T20:08:25Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T20:08:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"here is the log\n\n```\nNode: v4.2.1\nnpm: v2.14.7\nInstalling build modules...\nInstalling apm...\n\n\ngyp ERR! configure error\ngyp ERR! stack Error: node-v0.10.35.tar.gz local checksum 34ef8a38d75ded4f2aec3045abed4e31764dd337b6d21711a9ce852c2f547fde not match remote 0043656bb1724cb09dbdc960a2fd6ee37d3badb2f9c75562b2d11235daa40a03\ngyp ERR! stack     at deref (/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/node-gyp/lib/install.js:300:20)\ngyp ERR! stack     at IncomingMessage.<anonymous> (/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/node-gyp/lib/install.js:339:13)\ngyp ERR! stack     at emitNone (events.js:72:20)\ngyp ERR! stack     at IncomingMessage.emit (events.js:166:7)\ngyp ERR! stack     at endReadableNT (_stream_readable.js:903:12)\ngyp ERR! stack     at doNTCallback2 (node.js:439:9)\ngyp ERR! stack     at process._tickCallback (node.js:353:17)\ngyp ERR!

For every version downloaded, you just have a folder in the install dir that looks like `app-1.0.19`.\n\nA fix for this would be to have the most up-to-date binaries being installed to a folder on `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\atom\\` called **current**.\n\nAnd yes I know I can use the script (atom.cmd) as the default text editor, but me and most of the people wouldn't like our default text editor to be a script.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9314/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9313","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9313/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9313/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9313/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9313","id":113703471,"number":9313,"title":"Remove keyPath as a possible return value on the event object for onDidChange in config.coffee","user":{"login":"yakirac","id":1437231,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1437231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakirac","html_url":"https://github.com/yakirac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakirac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakirac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakirac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakirac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakirac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakirac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakirac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakirac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakirac/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-10-27T22:29:50Z","updated_at":"2015-10-28T23:49:03Z","closed_at":"2015-10-28T09:11:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/9313","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9313","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9313.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9313.patch"},"body":"Updated the documentation for onDidChange in config.coffee.
