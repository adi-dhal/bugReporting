actual folding mechanism is simply wrong and unreliable.\nI often work with big files and use folding to speed up my work.\n\nBut, if the file has a wrong indentation (something not rare if the files

seems unique enough to merit its own issue. I posted it here as it crashes the editor -- might be relevant to [atom/encoding-selector](https://github.com/atom/encoding-selector) )\n\nAtom 1.7.4 crashes (safe mode) when opening this large file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LibreOffice/dictionaries/master/el_GR/el_GR.dic and changing the encoding from UTF-8 to 'ISO-8859-7 (Greek)' via Shift - Control - U.\n\nIt is also significantly unresponsive both while opening the file (no feedback) and after choosing the new encoding for the file.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.

This causes the current viewport into longer files to shift drastically. The file I'm testing with has 918 lines, the current viewport is somewhat centered around line 481. Zooming in once shifts the viewport so that it's now centered around line 460, shifted by about half a screen upwards.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open a semi-long file\n2. Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+mouse wheel to change the font size\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n\nThe editor stays roughly at the same file position. Ideally I think the approach from browsers could be adopted which either keeps the first visible line the same (Chrome and Firefox do this, although this shifts most of the viewport in a surprising way just to ease implementation), or is centered around either the mouse pointer (IE and Edge do this) or the caret (if visible on the screen).\n\n**Actual behavior:**\n\nChanging the font size seems to keep the absolute offset from the start of the file _in pixels_ constant, which results in the visible lines shifting by quite a large amount when further down in the file because suddenly _all_ lines are larger or smaller.\n### Versions\n\n```\nAtom    : 1.7.4\nElectron: 0.36.8\nChrome  : 47.0.2526.110\nNode    : 5.1.1\n\napm  1.9.2\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython\ngit 1.9.5.github.0\nvisual studio 2013\n```\n\nRunning on Windows 10.0.10586 x64.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11829","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11829/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11829/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11829/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11829","id":156454400,"number":11829,"title":"Enforce block decorations to be 'before' by default","user":{"login":"as-cii","id":482957,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/482957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii","html_url":"https://github.com/as-cii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-05-24T08:58:34Z","updated_at":"2016-05-24T11:41:27Z","closed_at":"2016-05-24T11:41:27Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/11829","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11829","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11829.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11829.patch"},"body":"Fixes #11796.\n\nThis pull-request fixes a 🐛 that manifested when a block decoration was inserted without the `{position}` property.

We think that this problem manifests whenever the following happens:\n1. User/Package triggers a file save.\n2. `fs.writeFileSync(path)` gets called.\n   1. `fd = fs.openSync(path, \"w\")` gets called. This causes the file to be truncated.\n   2. Before `fs.writeSync(fd, contents)` has the chance to run, a hard crash occurs.\n\nThe scenario described above leaves the file in a \"truncated state\", thus erasing all of its contents. In the past we have experimented with backup files to solve this issue, but that creates other problems such as paths that are too long on Windows, and unnecessary events triggered on fs watchers that are monitoring the saved file's directory. It turns out that atomic saves are not a good trade-off either, as described on https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3158#issuecomment-124225148.\n\nWith this pull-request we want to provide a file recovery service running on the main process that keeps track of pending changes, and restores files to their original state when a renderer process crashes while a save is in flight. If the recovery is unsuccessful for any reason (e.g. problems with permissions, unmounted network drives, etc.), we log a message like the following in the system console and in a message box too, so that users can perform the recovery themselves:\n\n```\nThere was a crash while saving \"/private/etc/profile\", so this file might be blank or corrupted.\nAtom couldn't recover it automatically, but a recovery file has been saved at: \"/Users/as-cii/.atom/recovery/profile-950635\".\n```\n\nBy default we will use `~/.atom/recovery` as our recovery directory, where we temporarily store a backup of the saved file and delete it upon successful save/recovery. The nice thing about using the file system as our recovery storage (as opposed to IndexedDb), is that users can inspect it pretty easily and copy/paste content via Terminal.app or Finder.app (or their equivalent on other platforms). \n\nAs a convention, backup files stored under the recovery directory, will have the following format:\n\n```\n{originalFilename}-{randomHexNumber}.{originalExtension}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `originalFilename` is the name of the file without its extension. This string will be truncated if it's longer than `34` characters.\n- `randomHexNumber` is a randomly generated hexadecimal number. This string will be 6 characters long by default.\n- `originalExtension` is the extension of the file.\n\nThis should be long enough to make filenames readable (and more inspectable), but short enough to avoid path length issues on platforms like Windows.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11828/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11827","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11827/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11827/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11827/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11827","id":156431200,"number":11827,"title":"Auto-indent in Atom thinks one space is sufficient indentation","user":{"login":"phoenixenero","id":9031092,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/9031092?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phoenixenero","html_url":"https://github.com/phoenixenero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phoenixenero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phoenixenero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phoenixenero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phoenixenero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phoenixenero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phoenixenero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phoenixenero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phoenixenero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phoenixenero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-05-24T06:45:59Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T19:10:17Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T19:10:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nAtom thinks one space is sufficient indentation and promptly indents my code one space when I copy and paste or move code.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.
