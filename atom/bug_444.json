seems to suggest to me that `atom.workspace.getActiveEditor()` is returning an editor with no cursors which might imply that is has been destroyed already.\n\nIt would be easy to check for this explicitly in status bar but the fact that `atom.workspace.getActiveEditor()` is return an unusable editor is worrisome.\n\n@nathansobo any thoughts on

We wanted to let everyone know what we are focusing on right now. We're experimenting with how to be more transparent with where we're headed. \n\nHere's the plan: we're going to make an issue for each area of focus which contain actionable tasks, plus this issue as an overview into those focus areas. All these tickets will have the [milestone label](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues?labels=milestone). So at any time you want to see where we are, just check out the issues in that milestone label.\n\nWe currently have three main initiatives:\n- [x] Make the react editor the default editor https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2423\n- [x] Basic, better windows support for developers https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2447\n- [ ] Issues and PRs\n\nWe will be focusing on these initiatives, so issues and PRs relating to them will likely receive more attention from us.\n\nThe third initiative is a little vague, but it is an ongoing effort. It is comprised of our everyday work:\n- Fixing or responding to issues\n- Merging or responding to PRs\n- Coming up with ways to be more efficient at issue triage\n### A bit about the team\n\nSo you have an idea of who is working on atom at GitHub\n\n@thedaniel (http://atom.io)\n@zcbenz (https://github.com/atom/atom-shell)\n@izuzak\n@probablycorey \n@kevinsawicki \n@nathansobo \n@benogle\n\nLet us know if you have questions!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2447","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2447/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2447/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2447/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2447","id":34601334,"number":2447,"title":"Basic Windows support for devs","user":{"login":"benogle","id":69169,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/69169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle","html_url":"https://github.com/benogle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":62363277,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-05-29T22:43:04Z","updated_at":"2014-07-24T05:20:50Z","closed_at":"2014-07-09T16:27:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Our initial plan is to grease the path for developers to get atom for windows.

assumption of your build scripts is that all people use the default insecure permissions provided by Ubuntu but this is not true, quite a few of us default all user `umask`'s to `0077` and use `getfacl` and `setfacl` to adjust per directory permissions inside of the home directory, this results in dpkg going nuts unless you adjust the `umask` ahead of time which is fair enough for programmers and systems experts but if you plan to build a one-stop shop for building atom please consider taking into consideration consistency enforcement to prevent silly `dpkg-deb` errors.\n\nThere are several options here in my opinion:\n- Set the `umask` before you even get started.\n- Build in place and use `setfacl` on a custom tmp folder inside of the build directory.\n- `chmod` everything.\n\nIf you guys provide me with your preference I'd be more than happy to send a pull addressing this issue and providing quite a bit of system consistency enforcement for your Debian build scripts.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2436","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2436/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2436/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2436/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2436","id":34535514,"number":2436,"title":"Regex
