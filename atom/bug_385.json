Please comment on this issue if they need to be altered for your Windows version or configuration. :video_camera:\n\nThe new installer & auto-updater are built using the [Squirrel for Windows](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows) project. :squirrel:\n### Uninstalling the Chocolatey installed Atom version\n\n:fire: :chocolate_bar:\n\nThese instructions should only be performed if you've previously installed Atom using Chocolatey.\nIf you didn't you can skip to the **Installing Atom via the installer** section.\n\nThis will not cause you to lose any of your Atom settings since they are stored in `%UserProfile%\\.atom` and that folder will not be touched during these steps.\n1. Run `cuninst Atom` to uninstall Atom\n2. Delete the `apm.bat` shim at `%Chocolatey%\\bin\\apm.bat`\n3. Delete the **Open with Atom** context menu\n   - Open a command prompt\n   - Run `reg delete HKCR\\*\\shell\\Atom /f`\n   - Run `reg delete HKCR\\directory\\shell\\Atom /f`\n   - Run `reg delete HKCR\\directory\\background\\shell\\Atom /f`\n4. Delete the Atom shortcut from the desktop\n5. Delete the Atom shortcut from start menu at `%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\GitHub, Inc`\n### Installing Atom via the installer\n\nThis will not cause you to lose any of your Atom settings since they are stored in `%UserProfile%\\.atom` and that folder will not be touched during these steps.\n1. Download the **AtomSetup.exe** installer from the [0.149 releases page](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v0.149.0)\n2. Double click the installer once the download completes\n3. You should see a loading gif appear after a couple seconds\n4. The app should launch after about 15-45 seconds with an untitled editor\n5. An Atom shortcut should be on the desktop\n6. An Atom shortcut should be in the start menu under the **GitHub, Inc** section\n7. `atom` and `apm` should now be on your `PATH`\n   - Open a **new** command prompt or PowerShell window\n   - `atom -v` should print out `0.149.0`\n   - `apm -v` should print out a bunch of lines but the first one should be `apm 0.111.0`\n8. The app itself is installed in `%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Local\\atom`\n\nIf any of these things don't happen for you please comment on this issue.\n\nIf you have install failures please include the file at `%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Local\\atom\\SquirrelSetup.log` when reporting.\n### Automatic Updates\n\nThe `0.149.0` version **should** automatically update when `0.150.0` is released. There are plans to add menu items for checking for updates similarly to the Mac app but for now it will auto-update silently in the background.\n\nIf you have update failures please include the file at `%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Local\\atom\\SquirrelSetup.log` when reporting.\n### Uninstalling the installer installed version\n\nFollow these steps to completely uninstall the Atom version installed by the new installer.\n\nYou should follow these steps if something went wrong with the installer version or if you want to\ngo back to using a locally built version, a downloaded `.zip` version, or a Chocolately-installed version.\n\nThis will not cause you to lose any of your Atom settings since they are stored in `%UserProfile%\\.atom` and that folder will not be touched during these steps.\n1. Go to **Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Feature**\n2. Select Atom\n3. Right-click and click **Uninstall**\n   ![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/671378/5117303/98a7bebc-7007-11e4-8da7-9ac7f73966c5.png)\n4. Delete `%UserProfile%\\AppData\\Local\\atom`\n5. Atom is uninstalled.\n6. The desktop shortcut, start menu shortcut, open with context menus should be gone and `atom` and `apm` should no longer be on the `PATH`.\n\nRefs #3675\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4243","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4243/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4243/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4243/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/4243","id":49461229,"number":4243,"title":"Remove space pen views from docs","user":{"login":"benogle","id":69169,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/69169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle","html_url":"https://github.com/benogle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-11-19T22:16:48Z","updated_at":"2014-11-19T22:34:27Z","closed_at":"2014-11-19T22:33:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/4243","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/4243","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/4243.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/4243.patch"},"body":"They are now available at https://github.com/atom/space-pen and https://github.com/atom/atom-space-pen-views/blob/master/lib/scroll-view.coffee but will not be included in core in the 1.0.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4242","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4242/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4242/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4242/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4242","id":49458546,"number":4242,"title":"Final API Pass","user":{"login":"benogle","id":69169,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/69169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle","html_url":"https://github.com/benogle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118249520,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/api","name":"api","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2014-11-19T21:53:16Z","updated_at":"2015-04-22T02:00:00Z","closed_at":"2015-01-07T17:22:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Time to do a final API pass.

Usage is as simple as this:\n\n``` coffee\natom.messages.add 'error', 'This is an error message'\n```\n\nOr, rather than passing in a type:\n\n``` coffee\natom.messages.addError 'This is an error message'\n```\n\nThere would be 5 types: fatal, error, warning, info, and success. \n\nAdditionally, much more metadata could be attached to each message:\n\n``` coffee\natom.messages.addError 'This is an error message',\n  icon: 'bug'\n  detail: 'Error on line 5 of /some/file.less'\n  stack: # a stack trace\n```\n\nThe `atom.messages` object would keep a list of all the messages, and emit events when one is added.\n\n``` coffee\nclass Messages\n  constructor: ->\n    @messages = []\n    @emitter = new Emitter\n\n  onDidAddMessage: (callback) ->\n    # ..\n\n  addError: (messageString, options) ->\n    message = new ErrorMessage(messageString, options)\n    @messages.append(message)\n    @emitter.emit('did-add-message', {type: 'error', message})\n    message\n```\n### Rendering\n\nCore does not need to render messages in the UI. The [atom/messages](https://github.com/atom/messages) package could render the messages. This gives the user the option to create a new message handling package.

compatibility.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4221","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4221/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4221/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4221/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4221","id":49200687,"number":4221,"title":"Feature

File a stays open.\n\n**Double click on file a**\n- File a is shown, tab's title in regular.\n- Open file b. File a stays open.\n\nThis is really useful for browsing files as it does not clutter your tabs bar.
