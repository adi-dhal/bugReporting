It worked, I could use it, but I had to leave for the entire day. So, the next day, I could see a popup saying that Atom has crashed. I tried searching for the Atom application shortcut, but it wasn't there. I thought it wasn't installed properly, then I see an error saying Atom wasn't properly installed.\n\nSo, I tried installing it again... Many times. A popup saying \"Installation Has Failed\" came up:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14261499/12517609/718c3d46-c12b-11e5-8d2f-3bbb2bcd90d8.png)\n\nI even tried running as administrator, but that still didn't work. So I went to check if Task Manager to see if there was anything that could've have caused the error: then I saw, that there were multiple Atom processes running in the background. I started ending them all - one remained running as it was impossible to end.\n\nThen I tried again, and it broke. So then I googled the problem - many were having the same. So then I found out that SquirrelTemp in local AppData may have caused the problem. I tried deleting it, but it says it was being used - probably with the one remaining Atom instance.\n\nI also tried deleting the Atom folder in local AppData, but same problem of it being used came again. Here is what the Setup Log says:\n\n```\n2016-01-22 17:05:50> Program: Starting Squirrel Updater: --install .\n2016-01-22 17:05:50> Program: Starting install, writing to

have a two monitor setup. Left monitor 22\" is the secondary monitor. Right monitor 27\" is the primary monitor and where I mostly use Atom.\n\nWhen the window is in a certain position on the right monitor the drop down menu will be slammed to the very right edge of the left monitor. If I move Atom further from the left monitor the drop down menu will work just fine. If Atom is on the left screen entirely the drop down menu works fine. It seems that about 4\" from the very left of the primary monitor the drop down menu works fine. No other applications are doing this. Ran it in safe mode with same results.\n\nThe edge of the task bar is the cutoff between the left and right monitors. The drop down menu's are cut off half way at the bottom, I'm pretty sure this is just due to the pressing of the print/screen button; the full menu displays.\n\nDrop down menu showing up on left screen.\n![left](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11248197/12502010/c2962b2c-c089-11e5-92ba-abd1cd4e5861.jpg)\n\nDrop down menu showing as it should when Atom is moved further to the right on the right monitor.\n![right](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11248197/12502030/ee1a94b8-c089-11e5-83cc-cc34366cc77b.jpg)\n\nOS: Ubuntu 15.10\nDesktop: Mate 1.10.2 (Also was happening on KDE Plasma5 same setup)\nGPU: nvidia GeForce GTX 550 Ti\nDriver: 352.63\n\nAtom: 1.3.1\n├── MagicPython@0.5.7\n├── kobalt@0.5.0\n├── kobalt-ui@0.4.0\n├── kobalt-ui-mod@0.4.0\n├── language-cisco@1.4.0\n└── latex@0.28.2\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10546/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10545","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10545/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10545/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10545/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10545","id":128067401,"number":10545,"title":"Set Atom to have same number of columns when I reopen it","user":{"login":"corysimmons","id":224636,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/224636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/corysimmons","html_url":"https://github.com/corysimmons","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corysimmons/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corysimmons/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corysimmons/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corysimmons/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corysimmons/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corysimmons/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corysimmons/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corysimmons/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corysimmons/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-01-22T02:21:48Z","updated_at":"2016-02-09T23:24:24Z","closed_at":"2016-02-09T23:24:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When I close Atom and reopen it, I'm back to 1 column...\n\nIs there any way to permanently set it to show the last columns I had when I closed it?

Once you include it as part of a string all the color coding afterwards is messed up. By messed up I mean that it no longer seems to be able to differentiate between the html element tag, the attribute names, the strings they contain. They are all the same color. \n\nBelow is a screenshot, you can see where it gets messed up on the 10th line where there is a \"#\".\n\n![screen shot 2016-01-21 at 07 47 07](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11914897/12480842/37648204-c013-11e5-9009-882e724d7bcc.png)\n\nI've attached another screenshot to show how removing the \"#\" will fix the issue.\n\n![screen shot 2016-01-21 at 07 48 32](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11914897/12480875/6c42c2a6-c013-11e5-969d-c0ae7a614f84.png)\n\nmy packages: \n\nC:\\Users\\Justin Fuller.atom\\packages (21)\n├── angularjs@0.3.4\n├── atom-beautify@0.28.21\n├── atom-material-syntax@0.2.10\n├── atom-material-ui@0.8.0\n├── atom-minify@0.7.1\n├── auto-detect-indentation@0.4.2\n├── autoclose-html@0.19.0\n├── autoprefixer@3.1.0\n├── color-picker@2.0.14\n├── csscomb@0.3.1\n├── file-icons@1.6.14\n├── fold-functions@0.4.3\n├── highlight-selected@0.11.1\n├── KeyCount@0.1.1\n├── language-cfml@0.11.0\n├── linter@1.11.3\n├── linter-csslint@1.2.0\n├── linter-htmlhint@1.0.0\n├── linter-jshint@1.2.2\n├── minimap@4.19.0\n└── minimap-highlight-selected@4.3.1\n\n**Additional information:**\n- Problem can be reproduced in safe mode: [No because of no theme syntax in safe mode]\n- Problem started happening recently, didn't happen in an older version of Atom: [Only version i've used]\n- Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: [Yes]\n- Problem happens with all files and projects, not only some files or projects: [Yes]\n\nThis is the first issue I've ever submitted so If I've missed something please just let me know!
