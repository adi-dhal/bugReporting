Move the\nfunctionality into `Pane` and keep the same API for `PaneContainer` by\nadding a new subscription similar to its `observeActiveItem`\nsubscription.\n\nThrottle the async version of `didChangeActiveItem` because debouncing\ncan lead to a UI that is significantly out-of-date compared with the\nstate expected by the user. For example, pressing and holding ctrl-tab\n(next tab) would keep the event debounced for the duration of the\nkeypress. Throttling the event ensures most callbacks are still async\nbut are able to update the UI periodically if events are happening\nquickly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9309/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9308","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9308/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9308/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9308/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9308","id":113650735,"number":9308,"title":"Side-by-side install of atom master?","user":{"login":"lee-dohm","id":1038121,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1038121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm","html_url":"https://github.com/lee-dohm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":274751644,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/proposal","name":"proposal","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-10-27T18:27:01Z","updated_at":"2017-08-29T19:58:33Z","closed_at":"2017-08-29T19:58:33Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"I currently can have one version of Atom and one version of Atom Beta installed on my machine side-by-side.
