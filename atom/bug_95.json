The files are often from unrelated projects, and if they have the same name, there is no hint which project they belong to.\n\n![screen shot 2016-10-16 at 11 06 27](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5238256/19416444/c7fbc43e-9390-11e6-83dd-f017760f1391.png)\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Use Atom with many files.\n2. Have at least one Atom window open.\n3. Right Click on the Mac dock icon\n\n**Expected behavior:** \n- A sensibly long list. I am not qualified to suggest the appropriate length. \n- Or at least with some context, maybe grouped based on project name, or, sorted, or .... organized in some way.\n- A way to clear the list\n\n**Actual behavior:** \n- A very long list, from unrelated projects, with no easy way to clear it.\n### Versions\n\nAtom    : 1.10.2\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\napm  1.12.5\nnpm  3.10.5\nnode 4.4.5\npython 3.4.5\ngit 2.7.4\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12997/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12996","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12996/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12996/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12996/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12996","id":183244501,"number":12996,"title":"Sometimes, clicking automatically starts a highlight","user":{"login":"bluebear94","id":2975203,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2975203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebear94","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebear94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebear94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebear94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebear94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebear94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebear94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebear94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebear94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebear94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebear94/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-10-16T02:13:49Z","updated_at":"2016-10-16T18:03:20Z","closed_at":"2016-10-16T18:03:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [X] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n- [X] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [X] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [X] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [X] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [X] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n\nFor more information on how to write a good [bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) or [enhancement request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\nSometimes, especially after long periods of use, clicking in the text editor area automatically starts selecting text.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.

a long time in Atom we have been wanting to measure how changes in the codebase can affect performance. Until now we have been relying solely on Chrome's wonderful profiler to explain performance optimizations or regressions when opening pull requests or issues; however, even though DevTools are a great companion when it comes to understanding what's slow and why, we felt the need for a sharper tool that could allow everyone (not just the person opening the pull request) to:\n- Run benchmarks on their machine.\n- Easily compare and contrast two runs of the same exact benchmark on two different versions of Atom.\n- Store benchmarks and keep track of them.\n\nAs part of our efforts to make performance in Atom better and more transparent, we are introducing `Window: Run Benchmarks` and `atom --benchmark`.\n\n_Disclaimer: this feature is meant to be used exclusively for atom/atom and, although it could work, we recommend against using it for running benchmarks on packages._\n### A quick tour\n\nWhen opening the command palette, you can now invoke the `Window: Run Benchmarks` command. This will open a new window and run all the benchmarks found in the `benchmarks/` directory. As soon as a benchmark completes, a plot of its data will be displayed on screen:\n\n![screen shot 2016-10-14 at 12 08 03](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/19383899/e740b790-9206-11e6-84e3-80a36bf1d2ae.png)\n\nAlternatively, you can invoke `atom --benchmark` with one or more benchmark paths and get textual output instead:\n\n```\nOpening and rendering a TextEditor in large file mode:\n\n0   199.98000000000002\n1   18.894999999999982\n2   11.099999999999909\n3   9.565000000000055\n4   8.554999999999836\n5   9.670000000000073\n```\n\nYou might have noticed that the above output is formatted as CSV (i.e. there is a tab between the columns). This allows to import data into an external tool like Numbers.app pretty easily to e.g. perform comparisons between two or more versions of Atom:\n\n![screen shot 2016-10-14 at 12 30 00](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/19384533/f7a7ef2e-9209-11e6-8463-f39b9dbea513.png)\n\nOr to switch to a different representation of the same data:\n\n![screen shot 2016-10-14 at 12 47 08](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/19384919/5cd820e2-920c-11e6-8eb0-72441a51a20a.png)\n\n\"Single-value\" benchmarks are also supported, and they will not show any graph when run through `Window: Run benchmarks`:\n\n![screen shot 2016-10-14 at 12 52 27](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/19385086/1d6824f6-920d-11e6-9c28-e25076b67395.png)\n### Implementation details\n\nData is plotted via [Chart.js](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js) and each benchmark is a javascript file (named `*.bench.js`) that exports a function (synchronous or asynchronous) with the following signature:\n\n``` js\n// `test` is a boolean indicating whether the user wants to run benchmarks in a\n// lightweight mode.\nexport default function ({test}) {\n  const t0 = window.performance.now()\n  fun1()\n  const t1 = window.performance.now()\n  fun1()\n  const t2 = window.performance.now()\n  fun2()\n  const t3 = window.performance.now()\n\n  // This will plot one graph for `fun-1` and one \"single-value\" benchmark for\n  // `fun-2`. Note how the latter doesn't need to supply an `x` value in the\n  // object.\n  return [\n    {name: 'fun-1', x: 1, duration: t1 - t0},\n    {name: 'fun-1', x: 2, duration: t2 - t1},\n    {name: 'fun-2', duration: t3 - t2}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIt's also interesting to note that, for the time being, we will not run benchmarks on dedicated hardware. However, we will make sure that they won't become stale or out-of-date by running a more lightweight version of them (see the `test` parameter above) on CI via `atom --benchmark-test` (which, with this pull request, will be executed as part of `script/test`).\n\n/cc: @atom/core\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12984/reactions","total_count":40,"+1":15,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":20,"confused":0,"heart":5}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12983","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12983/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12983/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12983/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12983","id":183042073,"number":12983,"title":"The editor is not responding.","user":{"login":"satishverma143","id":11610172,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/11610172?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishverma143","html_url":"https://github.com/satishverma143","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishverma143/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishverma143/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishverma143/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishverma143/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishverma143/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishverma143/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishverma143/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishverma143/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishverma143/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":171329633,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-reproduction","name":"needs-reproduction","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":75,"created_at":"2016-10-14T12:51:53Z","updated_at":"2017-07-16T20:50:41Z","closed_at":"2017-02-23T20:50:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Atom Version : 1.11.1\napm : 1.12.5\n\nWhen i open atom then just after few seconds a window comes with this message \n![eee](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11610172/19387995/1312b9f2-923b-11e6-8e8b-0704b42e3df5.png)\n\nPlease help me asap.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12983/reactions","total_count":12,"+1":12,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12982","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12982/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12982/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12982/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12982","id":183008155,"number":12982,"title":"README.md Tranlation to Simplified Chinese","user":{"login":"LShun","id":9652305,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9652305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LShun","html_url":"https://github.com/LShun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LShun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LShun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LShun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LShun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LShun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LShun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LShun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LShun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LShun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-10-14T09:49:23Z","updated_at":"2017-10-02T21:01:59Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/12982","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12982","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12982.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12982.patch"},"body":"Hello, this is a translation of the README.md to simplified Chinese.

request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\nTrying to build the latest Atom 1.11.1 in Ubuntu 14.04 32bit results in a 64bit binary being created:\n\n```\nandrei@andrei-desktop:~/atom-1.11.1/out/atom-1.11.1-i386$ readelf -a -W atom | grep Class: | sort | uniq\n  Class:                             ELF64\n```\n\nAs you can see, even the atom executable path has \"i386\" in its name, but the executable is for 64bit. The machine is 32bit:\n\n```\n$ uname -a\nLinux andrei-desktop 3.13.0-24-generic #46-Ubuntu SMP Thu Apr 10 19:08:14 UTC 2014 i686 i686 i686 GNU/Linux\n```\n\nAnd:\n\n```\n$  node -e \"console.log(process.arch)\" \nia32\n```\n\nThe previous Atom version I was able to build properly on 32bit was 1.10.2 (I didn't try 1.11.0 or 1.12 beta).\n\nHere is the build log: http://pastebin.com/raw/WgywYX72\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Using Ubuntu 14.04 32bit, install nodejs v6 from its [official Ubuntu/Debian repository](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions). I was also able to reproduce this with nodejs v4 from the its official repository and npm v3 installed manually (installing the nodejs v4 package provides npm v2, and Atom 1.11.1 refuses to build with npm older than v3; this was not the case for Atom 1.10.2).\n2. Download Atom 1.11.1 and build it with `script/build`\n\n**Expected behavior:** Atom should be built for 32bit.\n**Actual behavior:** Atom is built for 64bit.\n### Versions\n\nTested on two Ubuntu 14.04 32bit machines.
