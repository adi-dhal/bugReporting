realize you's are probably getting sick of me by now, but I was wondering if there is some option one can pass to `script/build` or `script/grunt install` to build Atom beta with different installed file paths, so that Atom beta and Atom stable releases can be installed simultaneously on the same machine. See running `script/build && sudo script/grunt install` in the beta branch of this repo will install Atom in the standard file locations (that are also used by the stable releases of Atom) on Linux platforms, at least, as those used by stable Atom releases. So you will get `/usr/bin/atom`, `/usr/bin/apm`, _etc._ files installed at those exact locations, while the Debian and RPM packages provided by this repo for Atom beta releases will install the same files to `/usr/bin/atom-beta`, `/usr/bin/apm-beta`, _etc._ instead and let Atom stable releases use the aforementioned installed file locations (i.e., `/usr/bin/atom`, `/usr/bin/apm`, _etc._) for their installed files. \n\nThis issue means that presently the `atom-editor` and `atom-editor-beta` PKGBUILDs in the Arch User Repository cannot be installed simultaneously, even though `atom-editor` and `atom-editor-beta-bin` can be installed simultaneously because `atom-editor-beta-bin` builds its package from the Debian binary provided for Atom beta releases. \n\nThanks for your time,\nBrenton\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11000/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10999","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10999/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10999/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10999/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10999","id":137104833,"number":10999,"title":"Upgrade

This happens regardless of whether I opened the files with a single click or double click, and regardless of whether I double click the tab after opening a file. In other words, I can't seem to open multiple image files currently. This is also seems to be true for other non-text files (e.g. zip archives). For text files, I can get the expected behavior by opening them with a double click.\n\nReading [this comment](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10959#issuecomment-188920474) by @BinaryMuse, it seems that this behavior might partially be expected. However, I believe users will expect the same behavior for text and non-text files, especially non-text files handled by core packages (e.g. image-view and archive-view). If this isn't something that should be handled in Atom core, I think we should update our packages and possibly warn other package authors about this change and tell them how exactly they should update their packages. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10995/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10994","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10994/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10994/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10994/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10994","id":137018934,"number":10994,"title":"TextEditor.findMarkers returns all markers related to TextBuffer, not just those related to calling editor","user":{"login":"lierdakil","id":7275622,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7275622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lierdakil","html_url":"https://github.com/lierdakil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lierdakil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lierdakil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lierdakil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lierdakil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lierdakil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lierdakil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lierdakil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lierdakil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lierdakil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":163641905,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/atom","name":"atom","color":"f7c6c7","default":false},{"id":175213356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/question","name":"question","color":"ededed","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-02-28T07:09:18Z","updated_at":"2016-03-04T23:10:34Z","closed_at":"2016-03-04T19:54:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is relevant in case there are multiple `TextEditor`s with the same `TextBuffer` open, e.g. after `split-...` command.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug or a feature, but I'd prefer to get _only_ markers related to calling `TextEditor`.

Sometimes it happens (especially automatically after reloading atom) that the same file gets open in both the two windows. I worked in one window on one file for really long and put quite some effort into it. As soon as I clicked the same file's already open tab in the other window, the file's content got overwritten by the content version of the second window (~250 lines became 1 line, lost hours of work). No undo. Couldn't find a way to get it back.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open two atom windows. Use Add Project Folder... for the same folders in the two windows. Open a file in both windows.\n2. Modify the file in one window.\n3. Click the other window, the tab of the same file.\n4. The file gets reverted and saved, no way to get your work back.\n\n**Expected behavior:** The content in the second window should be updated. Or at least shouldn't overwrite the other file without question.\n\n**Actual behavior:** As soon as you give focus to the other window it overwrites the file without question with the previous content. \n###

up and is generally pretty choppy. It appears that there's some low hanging fruit in the scroll bar component. Anywhere from 20-40% of the time in scrolling is spent updating the ScrollBarComponent! I would rather have no scrollbar, than one that causes my laptop to heat up - is there a way to disable it? See the attached image - there's some expensive layout happening when changing the `scrollTop`.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. [Scroll]\n2. [Observe laptop get hot/frames drop]\n3. [and so on...]\n\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]\n\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\n### Versions\n\nYou can get this information from executing `atom --version` and `apm --version` at the command line.\n1.6 beta

somebody asked me to imagine a perfect world, it'd be one where coders used hard tabs for indentation, and spaces to align all code after a non-whitespace character.\n\nWhile this world will never

Because `TextEditor` had many dependencies, at that time we decided to deprecate the `TextEditor` export in the module returned by `require('atom')` and encourage people to use the factory so that these dependencies could be injected by the method without references to globals.\n\nNow we're realizing that was probably a mistake. If you look at the dependencies of `TextEditor`, all but `clipboard` can actually be eliminated via various approaches. Some of them absolutely _should_ be eliminated, because we're using them to subscribe to global events such as `atom.grammars.onDidAddGrammar`. This creates a requirement that package authors call `destroy` on `TextEditor` instances they construct or otherwise they leak editor instances because these subscriptions are never disposed. Other dependencies _can_ be eliminated in various ways but aren't actually causing leaks.\n\nLet's go through injected dependencies one at a time:\n- [x] `notificationManager` This is for notifying the user of the cursor scope. We can add a `getCursorScope` method and implement this elsewhere as well.\n- [x] `packageManager` This is just to emit grammar loaded hooks. Again, seems like we could emit events on individual editors and do this elsewhere.\n- [x] `viewRegistry` We won't need this at all if people implement `getElement`.\n- [x] `project` We set the project's path when the file is saved for the first time. Doesn't need to happen inside editor.\n- [x] `assert` A method for sending stack traces of unexpected states to the exception tracker. We don't necessarily need this everywhere and could even maybe look the other way using a global.\n- [x] `applicationDelegate` This is used to open prompts about file size. Could be moved and hopefully someday won't matter.\n- [ ] `grammarRegistry` Again, when grammars are loaded, match them against editors from the outside.\n- [ ] `config` Everything this controls can be managed from the outside (the workspace) and set options on the `TextEditor` directly. The only downside is that it would make it harder for package authors to match the settings of editors in panes.\n- [ ] `clipboard` This one is needed or you can't copy and paste. But could we have a private global for it via the module system. Essentially a singleton you `require`?\n\nSome of these cases are more clear than others. What's less clear for me is the config and grammar registry. What if the package author _wants_ a grammar to be automatically assigned based on the editor's path? What if they want to follow along with the user's settings for editors in panes?\n\nI don't have perfect answers to these questions yet. It could be that the newly proposed editor registration API could also hook up your editor with certain services such as automatic grammar assignment and tracking certain user settings. Bottom line is, unless we want to bet on every editor user to calling _destroy_ when they're done with our instance at the risk of leaking editors, these dependencies have to go anyway.\n\nThoughts? Tweaks? /cc @atom/core @maxbrunsfeld

issue is related to Chrome (or Chromium) and not specific to atom. But I am seeing it in atom as well.\nIt may be an issue specific to Mac OS X 10.11.3.\n\nI am posting it in atom because... well I could be wrong so having other people be able to confirm this would be great. If there _is_ an issue, then it's mutually beneficial for atom to also raise attention to have this fixed in chromium.\n\n---\n\nI noticed text in atom look pretty good, but Sublime always looked better. And I looked more closely and the rendering doesn't look like it's using subpixel rendering but instead some sort of grayscale. \n\nAfter double checking with \n`-webkit-font-smoothing: subpixel-antialiased;` \nI could not get a different result. So I decided to see if in Chrome it does better rendering, and I see the same result in Chrome. So I wondered if this existed in Firefox or Safari, it does not. In Firefox and Safari the font rendering look similar. And they look similar to what I am seeing in Sublime.\n\nThe report on chromium side is here: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=581166\n\nIn the attached picture, this is the result I am seeing when comparing 3 browsers, they are a close up of a piece of text being rendered on webpages (github homepage in this specific picture).\n![chrome-safari-firefox](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25837/13341888/93dab900-dc0a-11e5-9b2f-757397100d1e.png)\n\nI used the Digital Color Meter app in OS X to zoom in on the pixels, and then looked at the same page on all 3 browsers while taking that screen grab. Ideally I should've shown the picture example on a webpage that was \"neutral\" where I know for sure the CSS wasn't affecting the font rendering. But the issue exists no matter what page you are viewing, and also exists in atom.\n\nThe results I am seeing between chrome and safari / firefox is the same thing as when comparing atom and sublime.\n\nSo far  I and the original bug report creator (on chromium) are both running OS X 10.11.3. So whether this exists in any other OS X version, or another OS, I don't know. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10977/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4991","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"BAFB:366F:BE6F7B:1733268:59D92982","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=162>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=160>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"57b4c4eb29b107b723cfd3955b3586ca\"","status":"200 OK"}}
