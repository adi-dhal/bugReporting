Note that the screenshot used for the expected results is what I copied from the VM, and so has the Windows-style line-endings; I would be perfectly happy with the current Linux/OSX norm of `\\n` instead.\n#### Steps to Reproduce:\n1. Create a new document in Atom\n2. Copy text with line-breaks from anything in Windows VM\n3. Paste into Atom\n4. Save\n#### Expected Results:\n\nThe resulting file contents should delimit line endings with either the line-feed character (ASCII 0x0A, `\\n`, etc.) or a carriage-return character (ASCII 0x0D, `\\r`, etc.) followed by a line-feed character.\n\n![screen shot 2014-08-12 at 4 23 58 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1761309/3897190/8f5313a2-225f-11e4-8704-f32057d87ed8.png)\n#### Actual Results:\n\nThe line endings in the resulting file contents are delimited by the carriage-return character.\n\n![screen shot 2014-08-12 at 4 24 11 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1761309/3897235/fc009092-225f-11e4-8b19-dfedd499f484.png)\n\nThis of course causes git to show erroneous control characters in Terminal.app.\n\n![screen shot 2014-08-12 at 4 24 53 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1761309/3897254/1dac6270-2260-11e4-8065-89c0c31b2a1b.png)\n#### Extra Notes:\n- The dev tools don't show any errors or warnings.\n- Running `atom.workspace.getActiveEditor().getText().replace(/\\r/g, '\\\\r').replace(/\\n/g, '\\\\n')` in the console with an un-saved file returns `This\\ris\\ra\\rtest\\r`\n- Pasting the same text into a new document with XCode results in a document using line-feed only\n- I am currently observing this behavior in v0.120, but it is not new behavior\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3237","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3237/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3237/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3237/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3237","id":40080561,"number":3237,"title":"Namespace theme styles by adding a class to the body, revisited","user":{"login":"eddiemonge","id":127535,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/127535?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddiemonge","html_url":"https://github.com/eddiemonge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddiemonge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddiemonge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddiemonge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddiemonge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddiemonge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddiemonge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddiemonge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddiemonge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eddiemonge/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-08-12T17:49:25Z","updated_at":"2014-08-12T17:52:21Z","closed_at":"2014-08-12T17:52:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Why can't/shouldn't the main editor body get the theme name appended to it as a class?
