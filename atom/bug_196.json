integration of the block decorations API with the existing primitives within Atom (so, bear with it if it takes a bit to load :sweat_smile:). By default, we attach a decoration to a screen row: when the buffer changes or the underlying marker moves, we make sure to move the block decoration as well so that we can correctly calculate the other visual elements positions with respect to such decoration.\n\nA block decoration can be created through the standard API to decorate markers:\n\n``` js\neditor.decorateMarker(\n  editor.markScreenPosition([screenRow, 0]),\n  {type: \"block\", item: item}\n)\n```\n\nDecorations will be (re)measured if:\n1. They are visible.\n2. They are invisible but they were just added.\n3. The editor width changes.\n4. `TextEditorElement::invalidateBlockDecorationDimensions(blockDecoration)` is called.\n5. They intersect with the buffer splicing region.\n\nThere could be some edge cases I haven't taken into account, but here's what I think it's missing:\n- [x] Implement a non-linear (logarithmic) algorithm to handle screen-to-pixel positions conversion.\n- [x] `offsetHeight` doesn't take margins into account.\n- [x] Remove `addBlockDecorationForScreenRow`.\n- [x] What happens when resizing the editor? Some block decorations above could need to be resized, thus changing all the items' position after them.\n- [x] Correctly handle buffer vs. screen rows by invalidating the splicing region.\n- [x] Handle custom gutters as well.\n- [x] Inspect the `~ 3-4ms` slowdown when adding/removing many block decorations outside the shadow root.\n  - This doesn't seem to be related to block decorations having a unique `id` or being teleported inside the shadow DOM because of `<content>`. Instead, it appears that some styles that cross the shadow boundary make style recalculation a bit slower when many block decorations get swapped in and out from screen. \n- [x] Add missing documentation (mark everything as experimental)\n- [x] Allow to position block decorations before or after the marked position\n- [x] Update documentation\n- [ ] Test-drive! :car:\n- [x] **Question:** should we implement a version that works without the shadow DOM? Maybe we can defer this to another PR, when the API stabilizes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9930/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9929","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9929/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9929/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9929/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9929","id":120141630,"number":9929,"title":"Uncaught Error: Undefined screen line when clipping screen position","user":{"login":"greigallen","id":864004,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/864004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greigallen","html_url":"https://github.com/greigallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greigallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greigallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greigallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greigallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greigallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greigallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greigallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greigallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greigallen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":171329633,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-reproduction","name":"needs-reproduction","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false},{"id":211058624,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/uncaught-exception","name":"uncaught-exception","color":"e11d21","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":13,"created_at":"2015-12-03T10:40:41Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T19:11:49Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T19:11:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[Enter steps to reproduce below:]\n1.

This only seems to appear when the file isn't wrapped in parentheses (so it also doesn't have a function associated with it).  Probably just forgetting to relativize the path.\n- `file:\\C:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\GitHub\\atom\\spec\\config-spec.coffee` - ..._what_?  Seems to be the most common too :worried:.  I'm going to take a quick guess and say that the relativizing of paths is just converting `/` to `\\`, leading to `file:\\\\\\C` which is escaped to `file:\\C`.\n- `/C:/Users/user/Documents/GitHub/atom/src/buffered-process.coffee` - Definitely not correct.  This only occurs in custom logging, for example the config and deserializer validation (`source: /C:/file (line)`).  No idea what's happening here.\n\nIn addition, outside of specs, there's also a lot of inconsistency:  most exceptions will thankfully be either of the form `C:\\` or `file:///C:/` though.  However, the `/C:/` version is displayed for errors from `init.coffee` (`At /C:/Users/user/.atom/init.coffee:4`).  The actual stacktrace contains the `file:///` version though: `at atom-text-editor.atom.commands.add.custom:trigger-error (file:///C:/Users/user/.atom/init.coffee:17:2)`.\n\nOnly the `C:\\` and `file:///C:/` versions are properly caught by the Notifications package.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9923/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9922","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9922/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9922/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9922/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9922","id":120086034,"number":9922,"title":"Failed
