Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAtom is breaking on an index.html file that contains a newrelic single page application javascript snippet consistently.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nOpen atom and open a lengthy index.html file with newrelic\r\nAtom freezes and the editor stops working.\r\nError pops up after a bit stating \"Editor is not responding\" and options to force close or wait.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\nAtom opens the index file without an issue\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\nAtom crashes\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\n100% of time\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nAtom    : 1.14.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\napm  1.15.3\r\nnpm  3.10.5\r\nnode 4.4.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.11\r\ngit 2.10.1\r\n\r\nOSX 10.12.3\r\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)\r\n2.5 GHz Intel Core i7\r\n16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\r\nAMD Radeon R9 M370X 2048 MB\r\nIntel Iris Pro 1536 MB\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI have completely removed atom and deleted all the following files:\r\n\r\ndelete the app from the Applications folder\r\ndelete the invisible .atom directory from the home folder\r\ndelete the /usr/local/bin/atom tool\r\ndelete the /usr/local/bin/apm tool\r\ndelete the ~/Library/Preferences/com.github.atom.plist file\r\n\r\nI then reinstalled the latest version of atom. This happens from scratch.\r\n\r\nThis issue did not occur on the exact same file before the most recent update.\r\n\r\nIssue does not occur on sublime or vim. Index.html file is 30kb\r\n\r\nIndex.html file includes newrelic single page app configuration, which is likely the longest piece of code in the file. Other simple html files open on atom without an issue.

This way, if you open a folder and then a file, it doesn't stick around.  However, if you just wanted to open Atom for some note-taking purposes, the existing behavior is not affected as the pending pane item will become non-pending as soon as you write something.

This causes Atom to lose the project I was working on, and I have to reopen it.  The Reopen Projects menu is also empty, though it is populated once a folder is opened.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open a folder in Atom\r\n2. Somehow trigger an unexpected restart (I don't know if holding down the power button will work for this)\r\n3. After restarting, reopen Atom\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** The project to be displayed\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** An empty editor with only an Untitled tab (if that option is enabled)\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.15.0-dev-4eb3f22\r\nElectron: 1.4.15\r\nChrome  : 53.0.2785.143\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n```\r\n```\r\napm  1.15.3\r\nnpm  3.10.5\r\nnode 4.4.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.12\r\ngit 2.10.0.windows.1\r\nvisual studio 2015\r\n```\r\nWindows 10 x64.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThis may be related to #11406, though I have not been able to specifically reproduce that as 1) all open files are always saved before I put the laptop to sleep, and 2) there is no way for me to be typing in Atom when the restart occurs, as it happens as soon as Windows attempts to recover from sleep.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13757/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4162","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507404130","x-github-request-id":"9F53:366F:BDB50A:171CF50:59D92815","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=70>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=68>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"7d40dcf5ff19c61867ccd674ffe3af98\"","status":"200 OK"}}
