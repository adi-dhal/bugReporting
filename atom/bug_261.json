This is my first time doing something into a big open source project, and i'm quite lost. But I did solve a problem for future atom versions... I think.\n\nI downloaded Atom and installed some plugins, but it was quite sad when I discovered that Virtualbox and Chrome 41 are screwing everything on Ubuntu. I read https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6306, and @yuki-takei did some work to make Atom build with newer Electron versions. It looks like Atom is still using atom-shell 0.22 and in that version, Chrome doesn't know how to correctly determine if I'm using a mouse or a tablet.\n\nOk, I downloaded Yuki's deb package and text selection started working just fine, but a new problem appeared, which I think Yuki already knew and tried to solve by modifying `command-registry.coffee`. The problem is described here https://github.com/atom/notifications/issues/85, where I tried to contribute too. I created this issue to address this problem.\n\nSo I forked the atom main repo and applied the same code that Yuki did, but in my case I tried building with electron 0.29.2, which worked fine but the results are the same.\n\nBasically when I try to save a Haskell file with `haskell-language` installed (don't know if there is any relation here, but with .coffee files this doesn't happen) or clicking on the encoding or grammar selector (happens every time in our custom build), it throws a `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'nodeName' of undefined`. What I did to solve this was to add a new object to the `synteticEvent` object in `command-register.coffee`, in the function `handleCommandEvent`, so the object looks like this now:\n\n```\nsyntheticEvent = Object.create {},\n  eventPhase: value: Event.BUBBLING_PHASE\n  currentTarget: get: -> currentTarget\n  target: value: currentTarget ####this is the line I added\n  preventDefault: value: ->\n    originalEvent.preventDefault()\n  stopPropagation: value: ->\n    originalEvent.stopPropagation()\n    propagationStopped = true\n  stopImmediatePropagation: value: ->\n    originalEvent.stopImmediatePropagation()\n    propagationStopped = true\n    immediatePropagationStopped = true\n  abortKeyBinding: value: ->\n    originalEvent.abortKeyBinding?()\n\n#this is some code I took from Yuki's repo\nfor k, v of originalEvent when k not in syntheticEvent\n  syntheticEvent[k] = v\n```\n\nThere are some other changes in this same file, which can be found at Yuki's repo (#taken from https://github.com/yuki-takei/atom-using-electron-chrome-42/tree/edd8eec11d605ee77459232a010c1ac8a3a1ec42) or at my repo (https://github.com/ricardopieper/atom/blob/master/src/command-registry.coffee).\n\nAfter adding this `target: value: currentTarget`, the problem stopped happening.\n\nBut I don't know the Atom infrastructure, or if this is \"correct\" Coffeescript/Javascript programming at all. Could someone provide me some feedback? I think this is not necessary for now since it seems like it only happens on newer versions of Electron. I haven't tested the whole application to see if everything is working, but for me at least is working more than before :smile:\n\nI'm happy I solved my problem, but I want to know if I'm going in the right direction.\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7974/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7973","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7973/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7973/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7973/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7973","id":95957333,"number":7973,"title":"GitRepository::checkoutReference doesn't work with remote or tag references","user":{"login":"olmokramer","id":3612514,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3612514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olmokramer","html_url":"https://github.com/olmokramer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olmokramer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olmokramer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olmokramer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olmokramer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olmokramer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olmokramer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olmokramer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olmokramer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olmokramer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":171329633,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-reproduction","name":"needs-reproduction","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-07-19T23:13:43Z","updated_at":"2015-07-30T14:27:48Z","closed_at":"2015-07-30T08:36:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The following works just fine\n\n``` js\nrepository.checkoutReference('refs/heads/branch');\n```\n\nBut when I have a remote branch named `remote-branch` on the `origin` remote and I try\n\n``` js\nrepository.checkoutReference('refs/remotes/origin/remote-branch');\n```\n\nIt fails to check out the remote branch.

I open the console in Atom, if I evaluate process.env['PATH'], atom appends :/usr/local/bin at the end of my PATH variable, breaking the last path (in windows these are separated by semicolon). Following there is an example:\n\n[more variables here...];C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\;C:\\Users\\Piero\\AppData\\Local\\atom\\bin;C:\\Users\\Piero\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm:/usr/local/bin \n\nIn this case, since the broken path is the npm one, i was not able to launch grunt.cmd from atom-build. As a temporary workaround i appended a semicolon at the end of my PATH environment variable, so it now looks as following:\n\n[more variables here...];C:\\Program

having a bunch of strange issues with atom where like, the mouse keys (particularly left click + scroll scrollbar) feel like they are mapped incorrectly? Or it also seems like ALT is being held down? For example, sometimes `scroll down` would act like `left click`, sometimes `left click` would act like `CONTROL + left click` rarely, but usually it was like `right click`. At least, I assume it was right click because left click and right click did exactly the same thing (which was: bring up a one option menu with an option to paste something)\n\nAlso, it was only the mouse keys. The keyboard was just fine.\n\nExtra information:\n- Everything else I tried using had no issues whatsoever (ie. sublime text, google chrome, etc)\n- I was on an Ubuntu 14.04 virtual machine through virtualbox hosted on Windows 7\n- I got atom via this ppa https://launchpad.net/~webupd8team/+archive/ubuntu/atom\n- This started immediately upon launching atom, and never went away (related: if your response to seeing this issue is \"you should have googled X first\" then I just won't bother)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7958","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7958/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7958/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7958/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7958","id":95848343,"number":7958,"title":"setting to open files as tabs/windows","user":{"login":"ntessore","id":3993688,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3993688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntessore","html_url":"https://github.com/ntessore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntessore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntessore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntessore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntessore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntessore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntessore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntessore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntessore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntessore/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-07-18T18:33:39Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T21:09:03Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T21:09:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"While many voted for the changes in #3355, there should be an option to select the behaviour of Atom when opening individual, unrelated files (e.g. from the Terminal or dropping onto the dock icon in OS X).
