still have the line highlighted.\n\nThese are the steps I follow to reproduce the error:\n- Change windows with `ALT+TAB` and set the focus to this other window, also using `ALT+TAB` go back to Atom, the cursor is gone.\n- If I make this process but instead of `ALT+TAB` I click on the window button on my panel, it works because on each click I'm also setting the focus to the window.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3278/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3277","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3277/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3277/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3277/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3277","id":40308797,"number":3277,"title":"Invisible
