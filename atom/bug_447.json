the (not a big deal) problem\n\nPrevious to 0b5b741db4d5b03d6b97cc217ae2c40df892fa62 i was building atom on Win32 fine. The other day i fetched new commits from atom and my builds wouldn't work anymore :cry:\n\n```\nH:\\src\\atom [master]> .\\script\\build\nYou must have Python 2.7 installed at 'C:\\Python27\\'\n```\n\ni thought i broke something. i commented out that check and everything built fine because i do have python on my machine and its installed location on my path.\n## EDIT: See this much more better restatement of the problem\n\nSee [this comment](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2351#issuecomment-44435957) for a better statement of the problem.\n#### i propose\n\nThis PR adds a check for Python27 on the path on win32 machines and if it isn't, `script/build` says:\n\n> You must have Python 2.7 in your path\n\nMy initial solution is just to tell win32 builders that Python should be on the path. It may not be the best way, but it seems like a step forward to me. That seems like a reasonable thing to ask someone trying to build this :smile:. i wish i knew about a `which python`-like solution for node.\n#### history and previous discussions\n\ni'm conscious of [this conversation](https://github.com/atom/atom/commit/0b5b741db4d5b03d6b97cc217ae2c40df892fa62#diff-be3d85f44f8c9d04e5ce9becabab892b) and [this one](https://github.com/atom/atom/commit/f30c56c237dd157e0a12e21e86c832ec393a03d6#diff-be3d85f44f8c9d04e5ce9becabab892b), both mentioning that Python isn't installed on the path by default, so i'm aware that this isn't a perfect solution or may not be what you're looking for (the idea has already been floated for what i've done).\n\nIf this isn't the way to go about it, maybe we can :hammer: that out here?\n#### A brief aside\n\nThis isn't a big deal for me, and i could be wrong, so i'll quote Mr. Paul Betts's [comment](https://github.com/atom/atom/commit/0b5b741db4d5b03d6b97cc217ae2c40df892fa62#commitcomment-6336933) out of context:\n\n> If you don't have a C: drive, you're smart enough to figure out what to patch, :-1: to considering this\n\nThis isn't hard for me to patch on my own. i'm :cool: with just doing that.\n\n_For much personal improvement's sake_: Next time i'm just going to install python in the default directory!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2350","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2350/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2350/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2350/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2350","id":34073595,"number":2350,"title":"Selected text is deselected after right-click context menu is closed","user":{"login":"izuzak","id":38924,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/38924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak","html_url":"https://github.com/izuzak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2014-05-22T11:42:36Z","updated_at":"2014-08-16T23:26:01Z","closed_at":"2014-06-16T19:29:37Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"This is a continuation of https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/1619.
