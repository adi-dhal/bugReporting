If I install a `hyperclick-javascript` package I assume it would use `atom-package-deps` to install `hyperclick` as it would be useless otherwise. Both `go-plus` and `flow-idea` have a fair amount of functionality outside of simply being a `hyperclick` provider.\r\n\r\nAtom currently has dozens of builtin `language-` packages. What if instead these language packages were not builtin but _recommended_ to the user when the user opened the file for the first time? \r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nA new package, `recommendations`, would be accepted in Atom core. This package would define the UI and the consume the `atom.recommendations` service that any package could provide to make recommendations. Alternatively this could be put into the `settings-view` package as recommended packages might make sense to be displayed above or below featured packages in the install area.\r\n\r\nAtom core itself would make no recommendations for community packages.\r\n\r\nRecommended packages would remember what packages recommended them and the UI would communicate this so that users would not feel that Atom itself is recommending them. Below is a mock that could exist on the Install tab of settings-view.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-07-11 at 2 31 22 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/753919/28091859-414c123e-6646-11e7-91a0-48e20ceb8146.png)\r\n\r\nWhen a new recommendation is made it could show in the bottom-right similar to when updates are available. A message should also be presented to the user. Here is how this process looks in VS Code:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-07-11 at 2 42 27 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/753919/28092128-2fec5cdc-6647-11e7-8a3a-77539c92684b.png)\r\n\r\n`go-plus` does do something like this already (see below) but we could formalize what it does and make the UX much cleaner by integrating the recommendation process into core.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-07-11 at 2 45 09 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/753919/28092336-cc0b2f08-6647-11e7-89d4-c2d19bafc6be.png)\r\n\r\nBelow is a quick mock of what it could look like unified. I'd still want the package desc. as well as perhaps a select/unselect and Install Selected/All button.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-07-11 at 2 49 18 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/753919/28092420-2b1107ac-6648-11e7-9555-3282c783f4ce.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14995/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14994","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14994/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14994/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14994/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14994","id":242166472,"number":14994,"title":"Bracket matching not working at all","user":{"login":"Niichie","id":16381287,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/16381287?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Niichie","html_url":"https://github.com/Niichie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Niichie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Niichie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Niichie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Niichie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Niichie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Niichie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Niichie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Niichie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Niichie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-07-11T20:01:39Z","updated_at":"2017-07-20T23:43:00Z","closed_at":"2017-07-20T23:43:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

note that it is not necessary to actually access the volume (by e.g. opening a file). It seems that the volume disappearing/reappearing is enough for the editor to crash.\r\n\r\nAlso note that this behavior is **not** present when using File -> Open on the volume. Hence I believe it is related to the \"tree view\".\r\n\r\nCrash logs from _Scenario 2_ has been attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n[e0003a1c-b264-414b-849c-96d6ce864538.txt](https://github.com/atom/atom/files/1138162/e0003a1c-b264-414b-849c-96d6ce864538.txt)\r\n[operation_log.txt](https://github.com/atom/atom/files/1138163/operation_log.txt)\r\n[e0003a1c-b264-414b-849c-96d6ce864538.zip](https://github.com/atom/atom/files/1138171/e0003a1c-b264-414b-849c-96d6ce864538.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nNote that this crash is reproducible in both _safe_ and _regular_ mode.\r\n\r\n#### Scenario 1:\r\n\r\n1. Make sure the volume is **not** already a \"project folder\" in Atom.\r\n2. Mount the volume in DiskCryptor.\r\n3. Start Atom.\r\n3. Add a \"project folder\" pointing to the mounted volume.\r\n4. Unmount the volume in DiskCryptor.\r\n5. Remount the volume in DiskCryptor.\r\n6. Open any file from the mounted volume.\r\n\r\n#### Scenario 2:\r\n\r\n1. Make sure the volume **is** already a \"project folder\" in Atom.\r\n2. Mount the volume in DiskCryptor.\r\n3. Start Atom.\r\n4. Unmount the volume in DiskCryptor.\r\n5. Remount the volume in DiskCryptor.\r\n6. Open any file from the mounted volume.\r\n\r\n#### Scenario 3:\r\n\r\nThis is my daily usage scenario.\r\nThe volume has been automatically unmounted the the end of the day.\r\nAt the beginning of each work day, I wake the computer from sleep mode.\r\n\r\n1. Make sure the volume **is** already a \"project folder\" in Atom.\r\n2. Mount the volume in DiskCryptor.\r\n3. Start Atom.\r\n4. Unmount the volume in DiskCryptor.\r\n5. Put the computer to sleep (and go home for the day).\r\n6. Wake up the computer.\r\n7. Remount the volume in DiskCryptor.\r\n8. Open any file from the mounted volume.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior:\r\n\r\nThe editor should not crash when opening a file on a volume that was first mounted, then unmounted and finally remounted.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior:\r\n\r\nThe editor crashes when trying to open any file on a **re**mounted volume.\r\nThis is regardless of whether any file (on any volume) was opened or not.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduces how often:\r\n\r\nEvery time the scenario is repeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n`atom --version`\r\nAtom    : 1.18.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.15\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\nThis is the current version I'm using, but this problem has been present much, much longer than this. Perhaps for years? I'm not certain.\r\n\r\n`apm --version`\r\napm  1.18.1\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 ia32\r\npython 3.6.1\r\ngit 2.10.2.windows.1\r\nvisual studio 2015\r\n\r\nWindows 10 Enterprise\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThis happens on Windows 10 using [DiskCryptor](https://diskcryptor.net/wiki/Main_Page) to simulate an unplugged volume. Presumably, it is related to a volume being remounted, but it **could** also be related to network shares, as described in [ticket 14760](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14760).\r\n\r\n**Prerequisite**\r\nUse e.g. DiskCryptor to create a new volume.\r\nPlace a text file in that volume (in order to have content that can be opened by Atom).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14992/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14991","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14991/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14991/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14991/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14991","id":241959251,"number":14991,"title":"atom

All invocations of `atom .` seem to reflect the state of the environment from the first time I invoked atom. Moreover, when using WSL (Bash on Windows), atom seems to completely ignore any environment variables I've set in the shell beforehand. This might be an unrelated issue, but I've ruled out using WSL as a workaround.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. In one command prompt window, `set FOO=bar`\r\n2. In the same command prompt window, `atom .`\r\n3. In another command prompt window, `set FOO=foo`\r\n4, In this other command prompt window, `atom .`\r\n5. Print `process.env` in the Javascript console for both atom windows.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** `FOO` in the first window should be equal to `bar` and `FOO` in the second window should be equal to `foo`.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Both windows report `FOO` as `bar`.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Every time.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.18.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.15\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\nWindows 10 Build 15063.332 x64\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI've noticed related closed issues or merged pull requests, but they seem to focus more on OS X.

It also gives me the option to keep the editor open, close it, or reload it, but no matter what I do, I can not get atom to close and I can not get a working window of atom to open. All I get is a blank window that I can not close without another window opening.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. I am not sure how this happened\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Atom will open and work, and atom will let me close it and restart it\r\n**Actual behavior:** Whenever I try to close window, it opens another, wont let me reload atom or anything. \r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** I can't close it 100% of the time right now, but this has never happened before to me.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nYou can get this information from copy and pasting the output of `atom --version` and `apm --version` from the command line. Also, please include the OS and what version of the OS you're running.\r\n\r\nversion 1.18.0 atom\r\nmac OS Sierra 10.12.5\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nAny additional information, configuration or data that might be necessary to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\nI am using atom in tandem with github desktop, this might have contributed to this error. I am not sure though, I dont even know how this started, atom was working just earilier today.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14983/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14982","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14982/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14982/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14982/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14982","id":241727254,"number":14982,"title":"Atom 1.18+ token matching behaving strangely","user":{"login":"neumannm","id":729045,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/729045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neumannm","html_url":"https://github.com/neumannm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neumannm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neumannm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neumannm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neumannm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neumannm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neumannm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neumannm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neumannm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neumannm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":418477269,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/regression","name":"regression","color":"b60205","default":false},{"id":505038679,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2017-07-10T14:13:46Z","updated_at":"2017-09-22T17:26:11Z","closed_at":"2017-09-22T17:26:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

At first I thought it's a bug in my language package as I developed it myself for a custom language. But then I noticed that the issue only appears when using atom v1.18.0 and above.\r\n\r\nBy using the development mode I can see that the problem is, that the limits of the structures I have defined via grammar rules are not recognized as expected. Visually, they seem to be \"shifted\" but I think the problem is more complex.\r\n\r\nHere's what some part of a script in this language look like in v1.17.2:\r\n\r\n![atom1 17 2-no_error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/729045/28021719-275564ce-6589-11e7-830b-767c35c06e39.png)\r\n\r\nAnd here's what the same part of the script look like in v1.18.0 (and above, I also tried 1.19.0-beta3):\r\n\r\n![atomv1 18 0-error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/729045/28021722-2c9685bc-6589-11e7-880b-57e203f9009e.png)\r\n\r\nI think this visual comparison already gives an impression of the problem. I could also provide the relevant snippet of the grammar and a structural comparison of what parts are exactly recognized by atom here, if this would also help.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Install [my language package](https://atom.io/packages/language-oxpath) in atom version less than v1.18\r\n2. Install my language package in atom version v1.18 or above\r\n3. Create a file with extension .oxp or .oxt with content like this:\r\n  ```\r\n   :<test=string(.)>\r\n   :<test2>\r\n  ```\r\n  and see the difference in rendering.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** The token matching / syntax highlighting should work as it did in previous versions of atom.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** The matching of tokens and structures seems to have changed from v1.18.0 on. \r\nMight also be the case that my grammar has its own issues and that some reasonable change in the way atom handles those grammar rules resulted in revealing those flaws. If this is the case, I would like to know what changed and how I could fix my grammar.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nChange resulting in this behaviour seems to have been introduced in 1.18.0 - I have tested on v1.18.0-beta1, -beta2 and -beta3 as well as v1.18.0 (stable) and also 1.19.0-beta3. For comparison I checked v1.17.2 as the most recent version before the issue appeared.\r\nI am running Atom on Linux, Ubuntu 16.04 x64.\r\n\r\n### Additional

When creating packages, you can put cson files under the `snippets` folder but only the top-level folder is scanned.  I would like to propose a recursive lookup under the `snippets` folders in order to better organize snippets in a tree like hierarchy.\r\n\r\nI know you allow fo rmultiple snippets per file, but when you have a large collection of snippets, it is easier to organize via folders first.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a hierarchy under `snippets` folder in a package.\r\n\r\n```\r\n+ snippets\r\n  + wirebox\r\n      + snippets.cson\r\n  + testbox \r\n     + skeletons\r\n        + files.cson\r\n```\r\n2. Reload the workbench to activate snippets\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\n\r\nFor the snippets to register\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\n\r\nNone of the nested snippets are registered\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\n100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nMac OS Latest\r\napm  1.18.1\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.13\r\ngit 2.11.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14974/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14973","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14973/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14973/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14973/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14973","id":241258228,"number":14973,"title":"Atom 1.18 Crashing","user":{"login":"MyloTuT","id":3935521,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3935521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MyloTuT","html_url":"https://github.com/MyloTuT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MyloTuT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MyloTuT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MyloTuT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MyloTuT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MyloTuT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MyloTuT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MyloTuT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MyloTuT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MyloTuT/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":153145129,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/crash","name":"crash","color":"e11d21","default":false},{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-07-07T13:06:36Z","updated_at":"2017-08-02T22:06:04Z","closed_at":"2017-08-01T19:49:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

(Beta)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21206831/27934049-3bec3044-62a4-11e7-9a4b-27a3ae9a9902.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThe new Desktop Client for Github has a really sexy Titlebar. \r\nNot only because it matches the color of the application but also because it doesn't use the OS default application menu but a custom one inside the Titlebar. \r\nUnfortunately, the windows default Titlebar and the application menu are very ugly. Especially the application menu looks like Windows 95 when Microsoft introduced this grayish style which they didn't changed since for it. Sure, it's sad that developers have to come up with custom solutions but the windows version would look soo much better with a custom title bar like the Github Client.\r\n\r\nA custom Titlebar would also be nice on other platforms but on macOS, the application menu isn't in the window but in the menubar wich looks great and it should be there. On most Linux distros the Titlebar and the application menu have at least the same style so it doesn't look so bad there. Therefore the windows version of Atom is worst one and needs this feature the most.\r\n\r\nOther Issues:\r\n#13249 \r\n#4599","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14969/reactions","total_count":12,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14968","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14968/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14968/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14968/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14968","id":241042267,"number":14968,"title":"Previous automatically-saved project state detected popups every time I'm opening a folder","user":{"login":"jarrodek","id":3320020,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3320020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jarrodek","html_url":"https://github.com/jarrodek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jarrodek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jarrodek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jarrodek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jarrodek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jarrodek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jarrodek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jarrodek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jarrodek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jarrodek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":12,"created_at":"2017-07-06T18:16:46Z","updated_at":"2017-09-27T18:08:34Z","closed_at":"2017-09-21T22:24:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ive removed default content because it's not like a technical issue.\r\n\r\nBecause I'm using polymer-ide I have to open each component in different window (can't add another folder to current project).
