First, I'll summarize the problems I'm hoping to address, then move on to discuss my solutions as manifested in the redesign of the panes system. Some of what's expressed here is aspirational, but most of it works now. I'd like to get _everything_ working by the time I get to San Francisco on Monday night, then discuss it further in person.\n## Problems\n\nHere are the problems I've been concerned about, in rough order of importance:\n- **The relationship between model objects and their underlying Telepath documents is full of accidental complexity and boilerplate.**\n  Every model class needs to implement `::serialize`, `::deserialize`, and `::getState`. Model implementors also need to manually read, write, and observe every replicated property in the underlying document. Existing models currently have extremely similar code repeating all of these tasks.\n- **Reliance on global variables makes replication extremely difficult to test.**\n  The nature of testing means both copies of a replicated component exist in the same global JavaScript context, but if the component relies on global variables in that context it becomes very difficult to simulate the production situation of the components actually being in different contexts. We currently employ a test-only Environment object to repeatedly swap globals in replicates specs, and it's pretty awkward.\n- **Structural updates, where an object is removed from the document only to be reattached elsewhere, are difficult to express in a replicated setting.**\n  One example of this is pane splitting. When we split a pane vertically for the first time, we need to replace the pane being split with a _horizontal pane axis_ containing the original pane along with a new pane. Panes can retain arbitrary resources. For example, a pane that contains an editor causes that editor's buffer to be kept resident in a list of active buffers, so that all editors for a given file can share the same buffer state. But when an editor is removed, we want to remove its buffer from the list of active buffers if no other editors are retaining it. But we _don't_ want to release the buffer when splitting, because we're only removing the pane temporarily and intend to add it back to the document before yielding the UI thread. We currently express this in terms of reference counts and transactions, but especially in the context of replication, the code has been awkward and difficult to reason about.\n- **Because of JavaScript's single-threaded environment, we need to use asynchronous APIs in an ever-increasing amount of our code, which makes control flow more awkward and difficult to reason about.**\n  In a pre-Node environment, we made a pragmatic decision to largely ignore the sync/async issue and make everything synchronous. The wisdom of that past choice can be debated, but it's clear now that anything that performs IO must provide an asynchronous API as the default if we want to be performant. This reduces the utility of synchronous flow control constructs like loops and conditionals, and pushes us more toward callback-oriented programming. It's not the end of the world, but it doesn't scale very well as complexity increases.\n- **There's too much logic in our view code.** From the beginning, I favored an absolute minimalist approach and advocated that view framework code be kept to a minimum, which led to us baking a lot of logic into our views. The panes system is a poster-child for the downsides of that approach. Entangling the DOM's concerns into the core behavior of our components is easy for simple components, but scales terribly with complexity. It makes code significantly more difficult to reason about due to worrying about DOM concerns such as attachment in addition to application behavior, and worse, it makes tests way slower than they should be, which slows development.\n## Goals for addressing these problems\n\nThe goal of this pull request is to address the above problems in the following ways:\n- **Make it simple and easy to write replicated models objects.**\n- **Encapsulate the state of the system, while retaining as much of the convenience of global variables as possible.**\n- **Make it possible to manipulate structural relationships without removing objects from the document and reinserting them elsewhere.**\n- **Provide reactive abstractions that enable us to write _structured_ asynchronous code.**\n- **Provide a clean, boiler-plate-free mechanism for binding views to view models.**\n\nIn addition, this PR has the following meta-goals:\n- **Approachable power.**\n  Telepath must support programming styles that are familiar to most programmers. All abstractions must fit naturally into an imperative, document-oriented worldview, and present minimal conceptual overhead until people are ready to use them.\n- **\"Have it your way.\"\"**\n  Users will still have to write data into the document for it to be replicated or persisted, but you won't be _forced_ to use the model-based convenience facilities. They can continue to relate to Telepath as a raw document store, leveraging hooks on an a la carte basis.\n## Implementation\n### A Model Superclass\n\nTelepath now exports a `Model` class, which users can subclass to easily create a document-backed model object. They can use the `.property` and `.properties` class method to declare replicated properties and provide them default values, and the model class will automatically define dynamic properties on their class's prototype. Under the hood, everything will be automatically read from and written to a `state` document that is wrapped by the model instance.\n\n``` coffee\n{Model} = require 'telepath'\n\nmodule.exports =\nclass Pane extends Model\n  @properties\n    activeItemId: null\n    items: []\n\n# I can assign replicated properties when constructing a model\npane = new Pane(items: [item1, item2], activeItemId: item2.id)\n\n# I can read and write replicated properties without calling getters/setters:\nexpect(pane.items).toEqual [item1, item2]\npane.activeItemId = item1.id\n```\n\nThis isn't implemented yet, but I'd like to easily declare replication and persistence on a property-specific basis:\n\n``` coffee\nclass MyClass\n  @property 'transientProperty', persist: false, replicate: false\n  @property 'persistentProperty', persist: true, replicate: false\n```\n### Automatic (De)serialization\n\nIf you insert a `telepath.Model` subclass into a document (or any instance that conforms to a small interface), the object's underlying state document will automatically be inserted instead. Similarly, when any map with a `modelClassName` key is inserted into the document, the correct model class will automatically be instantiated for it if a model class with that name has been registered on the parent document. When you read the child document at a replica or after deserializing, you'll get its corresponding model class instance instead.\n\n``` coffee\n# Assuming 2 replicated documents doc1 and doc2\ndoc1.registerModelClass(Pane)\ndoc2.registerModelClass(Pane)\n\ndoc1.get('paneContainer.children').push(new Pane(items: [item1, item2]))\n\n# replicates to doc 2...\npane = doc2.get('paneContainer.children.0')\nexpect(pane.constructor.name).toBe \"Pane\"\nexpect(pane.items).toEqual [item1, item2]\n```\n### Scoped Property Resolution\n\nWe use global properties in Atom to provide convenient services, such as the `project` global, which can be used to open editors for various resources under the project and the `syntax` global, which can be used to select grammars. But as discussed above, the globals are causing problems when we want to test replication between two environments, because it makes it impossible to express component logic in a self-contained way.\n\nDependency-injection is a popular alternative to accessing services via globals, but dependency injection seems like an awkward cultural fit for JavaScript. It feels heavy and I'd be a bit sheepish about asking people to build all their objects via some container like they're writing a Spring application.\n\nHowever, we're already asking users to interact with a global Telepath document if they want to hook into replication or persistence for their objects. We might as well throw in a form of dependency injection as part of the deal.\n\nThe mechanism resolves around the `::getResolved` and `::setResolved` methods, which are available on every Telepath document. When you call `::getResolved` with a property name, Telepath will search for a property with that name, starting at the receiver and moving upward toward the root of the document. `::setResolved` does the same thing, but allows you to assign a new value to the first object with the given key.\n\nThis makes it easy to have a world in which objects in two different document replicas each can make reference to their own specific \"global\" properties while still keeping both replicas self-contained.\n\nThe `telepath.Model` superclass provides a `Model.resolved` class method for declaring auto-resolved properties. Putting it all together, it enables this mechanism for `PaneContainer` to maintain a single active pane. Each pane will resolve the `activePaneId` property to the containing PaneContainer, allowing panes to make themselves active or check if they are active.\n\n``` coffee\nclass PaneContainer\n  @properties\n    activePaneId: null\n    children: []\n\nclass Pane\n  @resolve 'activePaneId'\n\n  isActive: ->\n    @activePaneId is @id\n\n  makeActive: ->\n    @activePaneId = @id\n```\n\nThis might not happen in this PR, but I'm envisioning Atom only having a single global, `atom`, which will be the root of a Telepath document that encompasses the entire state of the application. Any other globals will hang off the `atom` global, meaning objects in the document can always resolve them.\n\n``` coffee\natom = Document.create() # create a root document\nsyntax = atom.set('syntax', new SyntaxGlobal) # assign a global property\nworkspace = atom.set('workspace', new Workspace) # create a child document\n\n# once attached the child document can resolve properties on the root\nworkspace.resolve('syntax') is syntax # => true\n```\n\nIf people don't want to use the resolution facilities, they can always reference things via the `atom` global:\n\n``` coffee\nclass RebelObject\n  constructor: ->\n    @grammar = atom.syntax.selectGrammar('james-dean.coffee')\n```\n### Atomic Move Operations\n\nAs mentioned above, we need to be able to express structural changes to the document without explicitly removing subdocuments only to add them back somewhere else. The best solution I can come up with is atomic move operations. At the time of writing, this PR currently uses derived collections (discussed below) as a substitute for `move`, but I'm working on adding the move operation and changing that.\n\nReplicated arrays and maps will both provide a `::move` method, which works as follows:\n\n``` coffee\n# Assuming pane1 and pane2 are both in the document, this moves the second item\n# of pane1 to become the third item of pane2:\npane1.items.move(1, pane2.items, 2)\n\n# You can also call ::move with an actual array element instead of an index:\nitem2 = pane1.items.get(1)\npane1.items.move(item2, pane2.items, 2)\n\n# It also works for maps. This moves the value at key 'foo' in map1 to the 'bar'\n# key in map2:\nvalue = map1.get('foo')\nmap1.move('foo', map2, 'bar')\n```\n\nAtomic move operations should make it possible to split panes without creating detachment/removal ambiguity when a pane is replaced with an axis and vice versa.\n\n``` coffee\nclass PaneAxis extends Model\n  @properties\n    orientation: 'horizontal'\n    children: []\n\nclass Pane\n  split: (side, orientation, items) ->\n    # If needed, replace ourselves with a correctly-oriented container\n    unless @getContainer().orientation is orientation\n      newContainer = @parent.insertAfter(this, new PaneContainer({isRoot: false, orientation}))\n      @parent.move(this, newContainer.children, 0)\n\n    index = @parent.indexOf(this)\n    index++ if side is 'after'\n    @parent.insert(index, new Pane({items}))\n\n  # our parent is an array, its parent is our container\n  getContainer: -> @parent.parent\n```\n### Reactive Programming with Signals and Conditions\n\nAs discussed above, moving to asynchronous APIs makes traditional flow-control constructs less useful. But I'm beginning to think the non-blocking constraint is a blessing in disguise, in that it's going to push us to program reactively. For example, say we have a vertical pane axis that contains two panes, then one of its panes is destroyed. In this case, there's no longer a reason for the vertical pane axis to exist, and it should remove itself with its last pane, then destroy itself. The `Model` superclass includes a `.condition` class method that allows us to write this kind of behavior in a reactive style:\n\n``` coffee\nclass PaneAxis\n  properties:\n    orientation: null\n    children: []\n\n  @condition\n    when: @children.$length.becomesLessThan(2)\n    call: 'reparentLastChild'\n\n  @condition\n    when: @children.$length.becomes(0)\n    call: 'destroy'\n\n  reparentLastChild: ->\n    @children.move(@children.getLast(), @parent, @parent.indexOf(this))\n```\n\nThe first condition says that when the length of the axis's children drops below two, it should reparent its last child. In the `reparentLastChild` method, the axis simply moves its last child to just before itself in the array that contains the axis. This causes the number of children to drop to 0, which triggers the second condition, destroying the axis. We could have just called `destroy` in `reparentLastChild`, but the condition is more decoupled. Regardless of _how_ the length of children reaches 0, we always destroy the axis when it occurs.\n\nThe `when` key in condition declarations expects a function that returns a **signal**, which represents a stream of events. A signal is a special kind of event emitter that can emit `'value'`, `'completed'`, and `'error'` events. Conditions will execute their action only when their signal emits a truthy value.\n\nIn this case, the signal is derived from a **behavior** (`@children.$length`). A behavior is a special kind of signal that always has a _present value_. When you subscribe to `'value'` on a behavior, your handler will be called immediately with the current value, and then called again whenever the behavior's value changes. In this case, the `becomesLessThan` method transforms the `$length` behavior into a signal that will emit `true` only when the behavior's value drops below 2.\n\nAny emissary event emitter can return a signal based on events with a given name via the `::signal` method. Behaviors can be created based on an event name and an initial value. For example, the `$length` behavior for a replicated array is defined as follows:\n\n``` coffee\n@prototypePropertyAccessor, get: ->\n  @behavior('length-changed', @getLength())\n```\n\nThat means its initial value is based on `@getLength()`, and its value will change based on the `'length-changed'` event being emitted on the array.\n\nSignals and behaviors are compositional. For example, `::becomesLessThan` could be defined in terms of `::becomes`, which accepts an arbitrary predicate.\n\n``` coffee\nclass Signal\n  becomesLessThan: (targetValue) ->\n    @becomes (value) -> value < targetValue\n```\n\n`::becomes` can in turn be defined as in terms of more primitive methods:\n\n``` coffee\nclass Signal\n  becomes: (predicate) ->\n    @map (value) -> !!predicate(value)\n    .distinctUntilChanged()\n    .changes()\n```\n\nThat says we should convert the behavior to a behavior based on the result of the predicate for the underlying behavior's current value. Then we only emit events if we're changing from true or false and vice versa (no repeated values). Then, in case `becomes` was called on a behavior, we convert it into a signal of just the changes (not the current value) with `changes`.\n\nBehaviors and signals are a work in progress, and are an extension to the [Emissary](https://github.com/atom/emissary) library which already contains our custom Emitter and Subscriber mixins. I opted to extend Emissary rather than use RxJS or Bacon.js because I don't like the hot-vs-cold signal distinction and wanted really clean integration with our subscriber and event-emitter patterns. This is core infrastructure, so I want to control it and incrementally develop it to suit our needs. I don't think fleshing it out will represent a major cost in the grand scheme.\n### Derived Collections\n\nSignals and behaviors give us structured abstractions for deriving streams of time-varying scalar values, but Telepath also offers tools for deriving _collections_ that change over time. The `Model` superclass offers `relatesToMany` and `relatesToOne` methods for associating derived collections with model instances. In this case, we're using `relatesToMany` combined with the `selectMany` method to maintain an up-to-date collection of all panes on the `PaneContainer`:\n\n``` coffee\nclass PaneContainer\n  @properties\n    children: []\n    activePaneId: null\n\n  @relatesToMany 'panes', ->\n    @children.selectMany (child) -> child.panes\n\nclass PaneAxis\n  @properties\n    orientation: null\n    children: []\n\n  @relatesToMany 'panes', ->\n    @children.selectMany (child) -> child.panes\n\nclass Pane\n  attached: ->\n    @panes = [this]\n```\n\n`selectMany` is a lot like `flatMap`. It maps a function that returns collections over all the elements in `@children`, then flattens the result into a single collection. The difference between `selectMany` and `flatMap` is that `selectMany` returns a _derived_ collection, meaning it will always be kept up to date as elements are added/removed in the underlying arrays. Derived collections have convenient methods like `onEach`, which executes a callback for all current and future panes:\n\n``` coffee\npaneContainer.panes.onEach (pane) -> pane.addHeader(new TabStrip(pane))\n```\n\nDerives collections can be composed. Here, `relatesToOne` is used to define a singleton derived collection for the active pane:\n\n```\nclass PaneContainer\n  @properties\n    children: []\n    activePaneId: null\n\n  @relatesToMany 'panes', ->\n    @children.selectMany (child) -> child.panes\n\n  @relatesToOne 'activePane', ->\n    @panes.where(id: @$activePaneId)\n```\n\nThe `activePane` is derived from the `panes` collection. We pass the `where` operator a behavior based on the `activePaneId`. Whenever the active pane id changes, the collection will update automatically and change the value of `activePane`. The `.hasOne` declaration automatically defines `$activePane`, a behavior based on the current active pane.\n## View <-> Model Binding\n\nTo be continued...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/920/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/919","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/919/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/919/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/919/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/919","id":20422171,"number":919,"title":"Test without window","user":{"login":"mcolyer","id":1424,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1424?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer","html_url":"https://github.com/mcolyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2013-10-02T21:10:52Z","updated_at":"2014-06-15T20:44:38Z","closed_at":"2013-10-03T17:57:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/919","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/919","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/919.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/919.patch"},"body":"I'd like to prevent the window from showing when just running tests from the command line.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/919/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/918","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/918/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/918/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/918/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/918","id":20421549,"number":918,"title":"If ~/.atom/storage is deleted nothing is serialized","user":{"login":"probablycorey","id":596,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/596?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey","html_url":"https://github.com/probablycorey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2013-10-02T21:01:08Z","updated_at":"2013-10-11T20:02:30Z","closed_at":"2013-10-11T20:02:30Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Atom doesn't recreate ~/.atom/storage and there are no errors.

is unreliable and we don't currently support CouchDB in production. The npmjs registry is basically just a set of rewrites on top of unadorned CouchDB API calls.\n\nHere are a couple things I see us having to deal with at first glance, I'm sure there are more.\n- **Package name uniqueness** npm and other package managers use a package name as the unique ID. Releases uses name-with-owner, e.g. \"thedaniel/cool-package\". I could see this being a problem when \"mcolyer/cool-package\" is created - we have all probably had the experience of picking through forks on GitHub trying to find the most active version of what we're looking for, and it would be a bummer to bring that suboptimal workflow along to Atom.\n- **Categorization and search** npm lets users self-organize with tags, and seems to index on those and the description field. Releases API [doesn't give us a lot to index](http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#get-a-single-release-asset) but perhaps we could go get the README from the repository and use that to assist search as well. Another option is to let users add additional metadata on atom.io itself.\n- **Client changes** Everything \"just works\" right now using npm, which is a piece of software with some years of refinement under its belt. I'm not too worried about this one since @kevinsawicki isn't too worried about it.\n\nI think that all this is still worth it because of the first two sentences in the issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/912/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/911","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/911/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/911/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/911/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/911","id":20340865,"number":911,"title":"File tree view 'exit'","user":{"login":"mattgraham","id":51578,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/51578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattgraham","html_url":"https://github.com/mattgraham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattgraham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattgraham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattgraham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattgraham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattgraham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattgraham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattgraham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattgraham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattgraham/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2013-10-01T15:50:29Z","updated_at":"2013-12-06T02:04:47Z","closed_at":"2013-12-06T02:04:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I find it weird (and annoying at times) that the file tree closes when you 'esc'.

Open Atom with no editors open\n2. Do a project find for something with a lot of results so that the view takes up most of the vertical space\n3. Open an editor\n4. Close the find and replace view\n5. The editor is now missing rendered lines\n\nThe following screenshot shows this bug, the editor has 37 lines but after the find and replace view is closed only 29 lines are rendered.

So I did a bunch of profiling:\n- [x] When scrolling, the Editor updates the position of the cursors and selection, calling `Editor.positionLeftForLineAndColumn`. When the cursor or selection is on an unrendered line, `Editor` creates the line! \n  - I added a check to only update the cursors and selections when they are within the rendered range (7f83b38)\n- [x] `positionLeftForLineAndColumn` is _crazy slow_\n  - When scrolling, the cursor doesn't move and the lines dont change, but the Editor still uniquely calculates the left pixel value.\n  - I added a cache of line-and-column:pixel-value (the beginnings in 5448da9, finished in 4852f0c)\n  - I wrapped each character in a span and changed `positionLeftForLineAndColumn` to get all the character spans, then sum the widths of them. This turned out take ~40% the time of the previous implementation. Yay! See  de9bfb4\n- [x] Gutter rendering is slow. It rerenders all gutter numbers when scrolling. The editor only renders the dirty lines. We should rework it so the Editor tells the Gutter to only render the dirty lines. Note: I tried reusing the current nodes rather than regenerating everything all the time and it is marginally faster.\n  - Implemented in fdd9e30\n- [x] `isVisible` is still slow. Turns out calculating the width and height is slow. In my previous tests the browser must have been caching the size. I want to find another way to calc it or eliminate it from the updateDisplay calcs.\n  - Using `css('display') != 'none'` again in de1346d\n- [ ] GitDiff rendering is slow when there are changes. There is a lot of querying the gutter nodes\n- [ ] Bookmarks rendering is slow. There is a lot of querying the gutter nodes\n\nI would like feedback in approach and other places to look for speedups.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/901/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/900","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/900/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/900/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/900/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/900","id":20201306,"number":900,"title":"API to Notify render processes when updates are available","user":{"login":"mcolyer","id":1424,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1424?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer","html_url":"https://github.com/mcolyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcolyer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2013-09-27T23:45:57Z","updated_at":"2013-10-01T23:42:00Z","closed_at":"2013-10-01T23:41:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/900","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/900","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/900.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/900.patch"},"body":"This is a proposal for how we can communicate from the browser process to the render process that a new update is available.
