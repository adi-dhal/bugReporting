(But I guess so basic rule (regex?) is broken.)\n\nI typically turn of all indentation management but in this case **it seems to happen regardless of the options** (Auto Indent, Indent on Paste, Normalize Indent on Paste) set. In my opinion, **it should (almost) never happen**, because we don't want to indent most expressions in programming, unless they are scoped. Likewise, for texts it makes no sense (to me).\n\nSo:\n1) For auto indentation this seems wrong, the indentation should not increase.\n2) For \"Indent On Paste\" (or any other indent options) set to false, it is a **bug**, because the indentation should never be touched at all.\n\nInfos: Linux, atom 1.0.0, also tested with git repo version 1.2.0-dev (commit 4b507be99769a38e0b8e9b26a950fc408951f986)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9045/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9044","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9044/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9044/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9044/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9044","id":109705244,"number":9044,"title":"Atom serializes DisplayBuffer scroll position correctly but overwrites it when re-opening workspaces","user":{"login":"tmunro","id":3076428,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3076428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmunro","html_url":"https://github.com/tmunro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmunro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmunro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmunro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmunro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmunro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmunro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmunro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmunro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmunro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-10-04T21:18:56Z","updated_at":"2015-10-09T18:08:40Z","closed_at":"2015-10-09T17:18:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Atom serializes the scroll position (`scrollTop` and `scrollLeft`) of each DisplayBuffer, but when you close a project / workspace and re-open it, it fails to restore the scroll position.
