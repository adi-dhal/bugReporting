This omits any `unset!` commands from the application menu to prevent that from happening.\n\nThis is more general than I would like. If the keystroke is unset in any context, we err on the side of caution and don’t add it to the application menu for any command. Since our application menu isn’t context aware, this should be good enough for now and solve the 80% case. Someday we should make the application menu update / gray out options when the focused element changes. Only then would we be able to precisely determine that a binding was unset in a given context, because we would have an element. Without an element it's just guess-work because who knows when a selector will match.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6997/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6996","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6996/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6996/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6996/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/6996","id":82090263,"number":6996,"title":"Skip
