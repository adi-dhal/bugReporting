I'm not even sure how to describe it, so perhaps there's already an open issue for the same problem that I couldn't find.\n\nI'm using Atom 1.0.2 on OSX 10.10.3, installed packages:\n\n```\n├── Sublime-Style-Column-Selection@1.3.0\n├── brogrammer-syntax@1.0.0\n├── brogrammer-ui@1.0.0\n├── color-picker@2.0.10\n├── ctrl-last-tab@0.2.0\n├── editorconfig@1.0.1\n├── rulerz@0.3.3\n└── webbox-color@0.5.7\n```\n\nJust let me know if I can post any other useful info. I read the debugging guide but I didn't think most of it was relevant.\n- To clear the issue, I just close and open a directory in the tree view. I'm not 100% sure, but I think that forcing it to redraw fixes the issue.\n- Switching from the Atom application to another OSX application has no effect.\n- Moving the Atom window, while it is the active window, or not, has no effect.\n\n<img width=\"202\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-07-14 at 10 23 10\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/690997/8669210/f0856376-2a12-11e5-9eec-da299ad3cb9f.png\">\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7888/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7887","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7887/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7887/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7887/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7887","id":94893900,"number":7887,"title":"Vertical resize only/resize to fit content","user":{"login":"aequitas","id":365827,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/365827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aequitas","html_url":"https://github.com/aequitas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aequitas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aequitas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aequitas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aequitas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aequitas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aequitas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aequitas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aequitas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aequitas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true},{"id":98445015,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/mac","name":"mac","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-07-14T08:27:05Z","updated_at":"2017-08-13T13:22:49Z","closed_at":"2017-08-13T13:22:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Feature suggestion: on OS X general window resizing behaviour is to resize the window to fit the content inside (reduce scrollbars) instead of filling the entire screen (for example Finder, Chrome).

Seems like the crash is caused by a `nullptr` reference.\n#### 8 failing spec assertions\n\n[Full output](https://gist.github.com/thomasjo/541278db1f5ac7675a87) from `apm test`.

Resolved in Electron v0.30.2.\n\nWhen running against atom-shell v0.22.3 Atom behaves as expected and leaves the application running even after all application windows have been closed. When running against Electron v0.30.0 however, after all windows have been closed the application exits.\n#### Building on Linux (Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS) is failing due to compilation errors\n\n**Resolution**: Using GCC 4.7+, or Clang 3.0+. Also fixed in CI by ensuring the usage of Clang instead of GCC.\n\nAttempts to build on Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS (64-bit) fails while compiling npm modules, throwing errors similar to\n\n```\ngyp ERR! cwd /home/travis/build/atom/atom/node_modules/oniguruma\ngyp ERR! node -v v0.10.35\ngyp ERR! node-gyp -v v1.0.2\ngyp ERR! not ok \nIn file included from /home/travis/.atom/.node-gyp/.node-gyp/0.30.1/src/node.h:42:0,\n                 from ../node_modules/nan/nan.h:24,\n                 from ../src/repository.h:29,\n                 from ../src/repository.cc:22:\n/home/travis/.atom/.node-gyp/.node-gyp/0.30.1/deps/v8/include/v8.h:543:1: error: expected unqualified-id before ‘using’\n/home/travis/.atom/.node-gyp/.node-gyp/0.30.1/deps/v8/include/v8.h:922:1: error: expected unqualified-id before ‘using’\n```\n\nThe compilation failure is caused by the fact that GCC 4.7 or newer is required due to V8 using the _template alias_ feature in C++, and that is not supported in GCC 4.6.3 which is the newest GCC (officially) available in Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS.\n\n**Solution**: Compile with Clang 3.4 on Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS;\n\n```\n$ sudo apt-get install clang-3.4\n$ CXX=clang++ script/build\n```\n\nFor Travis CI support, we should specify `compiler: clang` in `.travis.yml`.
