This can make it quite a challenge to keep track of all the changes being made in Atom from version to version. Unfortunately, that has sort of meant that our release notes end up being rather bare-bones summaries of what's changed in any particular version, rather than complete, well, changelogs. In addition, none of our bundled packages or libraries have any release notes at all right now - it's only Atom core. \n\nI think it's important to publicly document every significant change we make to Atom across all of our repos, which should make it a lot easier for users to know what to expect from each release, and hopefully help prevent surprises like https://github.com/atom/toggle-quotes/commit/8899f00c846d9e1525985f551f79cfb134f1bf5b#commitcomment-12552713 or https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8226.\n## Proposal\n1. Add `CHANGELOG.md` files to each package and library repo (or leverage GitHub Releases)\n   - I'm personally :+1: for `CHANGELOG.md` files - they're version-controlled, simple to update, easy to discover, and will be displayed properly in settings-view.\n2. Add a `CHANGELOG.md` to atom/atom to be used exclusively for core changes\n3. Update them individually with each significant changes as they are made\n4. Concatenate and organize all changelogs for atom.io/releases\n   - For UI here it might be nice to take some inspiration from [Firefox release notes](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/39.0/releasenotes/) - default to the short summary display, and offer a \"view full list of changes\" option for those who really want to dig deeper.\n   - Maybe even add the ability to filter by package / library?\n5. atom/atom release notes (ie. the notes used in GitHub Releases, rather than the `CHANGELOG.md`) can continue to work as the short summary of what changed.\n\n/cc @atom/feedback \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8240/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8239","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8239/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8239/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8239/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8239","id":99306955,"number":8239,"title":"Make it possible to open an untitled TextEditor from `apm test`.","user":{"login":"bolinfest","id":655869,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/655869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolinfest","html_url":"https://github.com/bolinfest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolinfest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolinfest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolinfest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolinfest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolinfest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolinfest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolinfest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolinfest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolinfest/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-08-05T21:53:22Z","updated_at":"2017-08-29T18:51:53Z","closed_at":"2017-08-29T18:51:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am trying to open an untitled window from `apm test`.

Sorry if it's a duplicate.\n### Issue\n\nWhen opening Atom settings/preferences with no project directories and tree view visible, an extra `config` node is added to tree view and atom project directories with path `atom://config` and class `Directory`.\n\nThis is a strange occurrence, and it breaks some code (see, e.g. https://github.com/atom-haskell/haskell-ghc-mod/issues/31).\n\nWhat makes matters somewhat worse is this node is saved in application.json and apparently haunts atom project directories even after Atom is restarted.\n### How to reproduce\n1. Atom Main Menu -> View -> Toggle TreeView. make sure left treeview is visible\n2. remove any project folder in the left treeview. \n3. Atom Main Menu -> Atom -> Preferences\n   then in the left treeview there is only an empty root node named 'config'.  \n4. Run `atom.project.getDirectories()` in dev. console\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4900","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"8FDA:4298:2C81D9:65CA14:59D92AD7","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=253>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=251>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"668e25e9ad5d27d3f39c5bded6c083c3\"","status":"200 OK"}}
