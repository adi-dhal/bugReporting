distinguish my Objective-C .h, .m, Markdown, and Swift (and any other programming/markup language) files from one another in the Finder when Atom is set to be the default app for opening these files. Currently all the files show the same Atom document icon. When files are set to be opened by Xcode by default the file icons are different based on their type. Additionally it would be nice if external packages could dictate different images for different file types.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Set Atom to be the default app for opening Objective-C and Swift files.\n2. View file icons in Finder\n\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]\n\nFile icons are different based on the file type.\n\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\n\nFile icons are all the same Atom document icon.\n### Versions\n\n1.6.0\nYou can get this information from executing `atom --version` and `apm --version` at the command line.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11245/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11244","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11244/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11244/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11244/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11244","id":142801546,"number":11244,"title":"atom opens only two files","user":{"login":"aleritty","id":2228273,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2228273?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleritty","html_url":"https://github.com/aleritty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleritty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleritty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleritty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleritty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleritty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleritty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleritty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleritty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleritty/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true},{"id":193722939,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/invalid","name":"invalid","color":"e6e6e6","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-03-22T22:37:15Z","updated_at":"2016-03-22T23:01:36Z","closed_at":"2016-03-22T23:01:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [X] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](https://atom.io/docs/latest/hacking-atom-debugging#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode)? yes\n- [X] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](https://atom.io/docs/latest/hacking-atom-debugging#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [X] Did you check the [debugging guide](https://atom.io/docs/latest/hacking-atom-debugging)? yes\n- [X] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [X] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [X] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n\nFor more information on how to write a good [bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) or [enhancement request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\nAfter latest update atom opens only two files at time.\nI can have two files in two tabs, when I click on a third it will open replacing the last (rightmost) tab.\nI can have three tabs open if one is settings tab.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.
