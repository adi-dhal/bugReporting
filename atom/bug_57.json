This has two downsides:\r\n1. If a package defines multiple grammars, the `activationHooks` will be triggered for any grammar. An example for this is the `language-java` package.\r\n2. if multiple packages define the same grammar, a package that should be activated if this grammar is used has to add `activationHooks` for every package and update the `activationHooks` if a new package implements that grammar. An example for this is the `language-javascript` and `language-babel` package.\r\n\r\nI think it wound be best to have another activation hook that works on the `scopeName` of a grammar.

When Atom detects that, it freezes.\r\nWas easily re-createable in safe mode, by opening the file, entering notepad opening the same file, do changes and save.\r\n_I couldn't find any related issues, sorry if I have missed any_\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open Atom, load a rather large file. (_Mine was 41k lines, 1920 kb in size_)\r\n2. Open a second text editor, open the same file, and add one character (or just do any change to it). Save the file\r\n3. Switch back to Atom, and see that the editor hangs for quite a long time. I am haven't been able to return to my work without closing the editor first (unresponsive).\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** I expected the file to be re-buffered such as in other text editors. (_at least get prompted about it_)\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** The program freezes and goes unresponsive. \r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 95-100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.15.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI have deleted the storage folder, reinstalled Atom, attempted safe mode.

Filling out the template is required. Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.\r\n* All new code requires tests to ensure against regressions\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nThis should fix some regression introduced by commit https://github.com/atom/atom/commit/c6cae5b8fdfea982084b068a0b38a7c988c52f51 related to `showSaveDialog` causing things such \"Save As\", \"Save as HTML\" to not work properly (default filename \"Untitled\" and default path missing when it should be autofilled with more \"reasonable\" ones--e.g. original filename and path). \r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the erroneous usage in [`src/main-process/atom-window.coffee#L268`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/c6cae5b8fdfea982084b068a0b38a7c988c52f51/src/main-process/atom-window.coffee#L268) introduced in commit https://github.com/atom/atom/commit/c6cae5b8fdfea982084b068a0b38a7c988c52f51\r\n```coffeescript\r\ndialog.showSaveDialog(this, params)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, `this` refers to an instance of AtomWindow, when the function `dialog.showSaveDialog` requires the first argument to be a BrowserWindow [`electron/lib/browser/api/dialog.js#L24`](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/lib/browser/api/dialog.js#L24). \r\n\r\nSo I believe the fix is simply \r\n```coffeescript\r\ndialog.showSaveDialog(@browserWindow, params)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is consistent with with the function binding usage in [`src/main-process/atom-window.coffee#L86@c6cae5b`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/c6cae5b8fdfea982084b068a0b38a7c988c52f51/src/main-process/atom-window.coffee#L86) and with the **old** working function `showSaveDialog` in [`src/application-delegate.coffee#L158`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/ae9d949ee4e199d1884bed89083196fa375bbd34/src/application-delegate.coffee#L158)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nWe must be able to understand the design of your change from this description.
