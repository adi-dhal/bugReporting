Background\n\nHi, pressing ctrl-c on an empty line, copies the whole line.

See #10769 for a test case.\n\nThis commit checks the special case of clicking below the buffer and returns the position without going into the whole calculation loop. I'm not super familiar with how the internals of Atom work, and I assumed going through all this calculation to find the very last cursor position was needed due to surrogate pairs or something. But it seems that's not the case as the last column position can be found by just summing the row's textNode lengths, so short circuiting that logic brings a perf win.\n\nThis stops freezing for clicking below long lines, but doesn't solve the whole perf problem with seeking long lines. If you were to scroll to the end of a long line and click somewhere close to the end, it will still hang. Perhaps you could calculate the position backwards if the click position is in the latter half of the long line? Either way, that's a discussion for another issue/PR.\n\nAs far as tests go, I'm not really sure how you run the line-yardstick specs? Running `script/test` had a lot of failures on master for other specs. I don't think any new specs for line-yardstick is required since it already covers testing clicking below the buffer.\n\nResolves #10769\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11538","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11538/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11538/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11538/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11538","id":149685969,"number":11538,"title":"Repeatedly collapsing/expanding folders in tree-view crashes the editor","user":{"login":"Ingramz","id":1017132,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1017132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ingramz","html_url":"https://github.com/Ingramz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ingramz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ingramz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ingramz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ingramz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ingramz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ingramz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ingramz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ingramz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ingramz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-04-20T07:41:17Z","updated_at":"2016-04-20T12:14:34Z","closed_at":"2016-04-20T12:14:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\n![tree_view_crash](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1017132/14666823/59fc31c8-06e4-11e6-8c6f-75b838c87fa1.gif)\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.

The squirrel icon is displayed in the status bar. If I click the icon, a pane opens and displays a message that \"Atom is update to date!\" and shows version 1.7.1 at the top of the pane under the Atom logo. Automatically download updates is selected. If I click  \"Check Now\" an alert appears and says \"no update available\" and \"Version 1.7.1 is the latest version.\" If I go to the Help menu and select \"check for update\" I get the same alert. When going to https://atom.io/docs, I see it reports the most recent version is 1.7.2. So, it seems that somehow the status bar knows there is an update available even though the rest of Atom doesn't.\n\nIf I restart Atom, it will update to 1.7.2 (this has happened to me quite a few times in the past, pretty much with every update that gets released). Atom will function normally (no squirrel icon) until the next update is released, at which time I expect that I'll see this issue again.\n\nI see an app-1.7.1 and app-1.7.2 in my AppData/Local/atom folder.\n\nOS: Windows 10, version 1511 build 10586.218\natom.exe --version (from app-1.7.1 directory; running atom --version from path returns no output) returns:\n  Atom    : 1.7.1\n  Electron: 0.36.8\n  Chrome  : 47.0.2526.110\n  Node    : 5.1.1\n\napm --version returns:\n  apm  1.9.2\n  npm  2.13.3\n  node 0.10.40\n  python 2.7.9\n  git 2.7.1.windows.2\n  visual studio\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11525","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11525/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11525/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11525/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11525","id":149456520,"number":11525,"title":"At the building stage, Running \"download-electron\" task ends with an error","user":{"login":"PsiReaver","id":18550786,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/18550786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PsiReaver","html_url":"https://github.com/PsiReaver","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PsiReaver/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PsiReaver/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PsiReaver/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PsiReaver/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PsiReaver/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PsiReaver/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PsiReaver/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PsiReaver/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PsiReaver/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98407029,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/build-error","name":"build-error","color":"f7c6c7","default":false},{"id":97577987,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/linux","name":"linux","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-04-19T13:05:17Z","updated_at":"2016-05-31T20:45:54Z","closed_at":"2016-05-31T20:45:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Atom v1.7.2\nNode: v4.4.3\nnpm: v2.13.3\nLinux Mint 17.3 Rosa (Linux version 3.13.0-24-generic)\n\nAt the building stage (script/build), the script ends at the following task with an error:\n\n`Running \"download-electron\" task`\n`Fatal error: Request path contains unescaped characters.`\n\n`TypeError: Request path contains unescaped characters.`\n `at new ClientRequest (_http_client.js:50:11)`\n`at TunnelingAgent.exports.request (http.js:31:10)`\n`at TunnelingAgent.createSocket (/home/usr/Downloads/atom/build/node_modules/request/node_modules/tunnel-agent/index.js:117:25)`\n`at TunnelingAgent.createSecureSocket [as createSocket] (/home/usr/Downloads/atom/build/node_modules/request/node_modules/tunnel-agent/index.js:184:41)`\n `at TunnelingAgent.addRequest (/home/usr/Downloads/atom/build/node_modules/request/node_modules/tunnel-agent/index.js:80:8)`\n`at new ClientRequest (_http_client.js:131:16)`\n`at Object.exports.request (http.js:31:10)`\n`at Object.socket.once.exports.request (https.js:182:15)`\n`at Request.start (/home/usr/Downloads/atom/build/node_modules/request/request.js:585:30)`\n`at Request.end (/home/usr/Downloads/atom/build/node_modules/request/request.js:1213:28)`\n`at /home/usr/Downloads/atom/build/node_modules/request/request.js:417:12`\n`at nextTickCallbackWith0Args (node.js:420:9)`\n`at process._tickDomainCallback (node.js:390:13)`\n`at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:443:11)`\n`at startup (node.js:139:18)`\n`at node.js:968:3`\n\nThis error occurs only if I set environment variables `http_proxy` or `https_proxy`.
