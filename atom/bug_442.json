Here's a decoration:\n\n``` js\n{type: 'gutter', class: 'my-sweet-class'}\n```\n\nAnd here is how to attach it to a buffer row:\n\n``` coffee\neditor.addDecorationToBufferRow(1, {type: 'gutter', class: 'my-sweet-class'})\n```\n\nCurrently the only thing that renders a decoration is the `GutterComponent` and it only cares about decorations with `type: 'gutter'`. It will add the decoration's `class` property as a class to the proper line-number node in the gutter. \n\nThe neat thing is that the `GutterComponent` handles all the bs with updating as line number nodes are added and removed. So no more watching the `display-updated` event and manually updating classes in packages like `git-diff` and `bookmarks`.\n### Markers\n\nThere is a marker API as well. Packages like `bookmarks` should not be watching the markers and updating their decorations manually. \n\n``` coffee\nmarker = editor.displayBuffer.markBufferRange([[2, 13], [3, 15]], class: 'my-marker', invalidate: 'inside')\ndecoration = {type: 'gutter', class: 'marker-class'}\neditor.addDecorationToMarker(marker, decoration)\n```\n\nThe class `marker-class` will properly track the marker's rows on the gutter.\n### Options\n\nSometimes you might want a decoration to show on wrapped lines (git-diff), and sometimes you dont (bookmarks), so there is an option: `softWrap`. Like so: `{type: 'gutter', class: 'marker-class', softWrap: true}`. If you have ideas on how better to pass options, let me know.\n### Removing decorations\n\nCurrently you can only remove them on each buffer row. Like finding markers, it will remove any decoration that matches the pattern.\n\n``` coffee\neditor.addDecorationToBufferRow(1, {type: 'gutter', class: 'my-sweet-class', namespace: 'cats'})\neditor.addDecorationToBufferRow(1, {type: 'gutter', class: 'my-other-class', namespace: 'cats'})\n\n# this will remove the previous two\neditor.removeDecorationFromBufferRow(1, {namespace: 'cats'})\n\n# usually you'll probably just have one class and do this\neditor.removeDecorationFromBufferRow(1, {type: 'gutter', class: 'my-other-class'})\n```\n\nThe api works the same for marker decorations. \n### TODO\n- [x] Deprecate the old gutter methods\n- [x] Figure out where to put this api. @nathansobo on the `ReactEditorView`? Now its on `Editor`.\n- [x] Maybe pull the folds out to be decorations??\n- [x] Docs\n- [x] Tests for `cursor-line` decoration\n- [x] Add a `cursor-line-no-selection` decoration\n- [x] Tests for 'typeless' decorations\n\nFixes #1984\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2507/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2506","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2506/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2506/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2506/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2506","id":35013843,"number":2506,"title":"Add concrete install instructions for Fedora Linux","user":{"login":"Bengt","id":11575,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bengt","html_url":"https://github.com/Bengt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bengt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bengt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bengt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bengt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bengt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bengt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bengt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bengt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bengt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-06-04T23:06:05Z","updated_at":"2014-06-13T07:24:27Z","closed_at":"2014-06-05T16:56:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/2506","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2506","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2506.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2506.patch"},"body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2506/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2505","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2505/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2505/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2505/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2505","id":35006135,"number":2505,"title":"Windows: Backslash does not work with German keyboard layout","user":{"login":"tonka3000","id":3163807,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3163807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonka3000","html_url":"https://github.com/tonka3000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonka3000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonka3000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonka3000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonka3000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonka3000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonka3000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonka3000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonka3000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonka3000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-06-04T21:32:24Z","updated_at":"2014-06-05T05:06:15Z","closed_at":"2014-06-05T05:06:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have a problem with the Backslash key in a Windows build with an german keyboard layout => if I press it, it do nothing :-(\n\nI've using 0.99 and 0.101, both has this effect.

isn't necessarily broken, but just something odd I've run into. I teach a class, and use Atom for my editor to show examples of code. Since my code is being projected on a screen to a classroom, I have my font-size set crazy high. Like, ridiculously high. The issue is that when I create a new file or folder, the text inside that field is that same size in which no one is able to see what I'm typing.\n\nHere is a screenshot of what that looks like. Maybe as a suggestion, that text field could remain a normal size?\n\n![screen shot 2014-06-04 at 1 45 21 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2391/3179005/cf98c436-ec20-11e3-9193-469b210d39a7.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2502","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2502/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2502/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2502/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2502","id":34966984,"number":2502,"title":"Add debugging guide","user":{"login":"izuzak","id":38924,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/38924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak","html_url":"https://github.com/izuzak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2014-06-04T15:02:04Z","updated_at":"2014-06-13T01:34:40Z","closed_at":"2014-06-05T20:22:36Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/2502","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2502","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2502.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2502.patch"},"body":"This is the first part of a guide on debugging problems and errors in Atom.

The problem\n\nWhen brand-new, like me, the problem could be anywhere, so I'm clumsily looking at **everything** to try and figure out where the issue is. All I can see is that nothing happens. The specific issue was that I had the command correctly loaded into the `activationEvents` in the json file, and my \"lib/my-project.coffee\" worked correctly, but I didn't have the `main` set up to load the file (because I generated it with `$ apm init --convert` to load my TextMate plugin rather than with `generate:package`).\n\nI assume what happens is that when I run the command, it goes to find the command, which should be there because it is added in the `activate` key. But it is not there since the file did not get loaded. Because it is not there, it silently fails and removes the commands from the list of commands.\n## The desired behaviour\n\nIdeally, the system would log enough information for me to figure out where the issue is.\n\nKeep in mind that I'm very very new so I have very little ability to troubleshoot based on reasoning about the system. I'd like to know it's not in my keymap file, it's not in my package.json. Something like this would be helpful: \"my-package:my-command was registered as an activationEvent, but could not be found as a command.\" maybe also a link to common reasons this could happen such as: the command was never, the name is wrong (describing a way to see the list of registered commands in the given namespace would help a lot here), the file was never required, the file wasn't specified in the main command of package.json.\n## Another Possibility\n\nI don't know if it's reasonable to have .coffee files in lib without having a main in package.json, but maybe a linting of package.json would catch this? Or maybe there's a combination of things: files in lib, no main, commands in activationList. If this is something that could be caught, it would also be nice if it would run automatically on saving of package.json\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2498","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2498/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2498/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2498/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2498","id":34908687,"number":2498,"title":"Moving
