To appropriately use word 'linux' and to rename `linux` label to `GNU`\n\n---\n\nWhat you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU `corelibs`, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.\n\nThrough a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called 'Linux', and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.\n\nThus, making it incorrect to list 'linux' tag among 'mac' and 'windows'.\n1. Bugs, that were currently labelled 'linux' do not apply directly to the Linux kernel. But to the whole stack of GNU operating system: including it's core utilities, X window system. This can lead to confusion.\n2. Atom can be run on many kernels, including [FreeBSD's](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/docs/build-instructions/freebsd.md). It would be wrong to file BSD-related bugs under the tag of 'linux'. On other hand, 'GNU' tag would cover such variations, as [Debian GNU/kFreeBSD](https://www.debian.org/ports/kfreebsd-gnu/).\n3. GNU operating system can be run many other kernels, such as GNU HURD or Darwin’s XNU kernel, which users too might run Atom editor. 'GNU' tag will cover this.\n4. To call the whole system 'Linux' is both unfair and confusing, because it does not give the GNU Project credit and makes it hard to distinguish the whole system from the kernel alone.\n\nRead more about 'GNU' and 'linux' confusion:\n- [Linux and the GNU System](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html)\n- [Why GNU/Linux?](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/why-gnu-linux.html)\n- [GNU Users Who Have Never Heard of GNU](http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-users-never-heard-of-gnu.html)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5347","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5347/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5347/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5347/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5347","id":56171740,"number":5347,"title":"Fix indent guides missing on whitespace only lines with invisible characters","user":{"login":"driskell","id":939815,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/939815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/driskell","html_url":"https://github.com/driskell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driskell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driskell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driskell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driskell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driskell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driskell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driskell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driskell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driskell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":163641905,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/atom","name":"atom","color":"f7c6c7","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-02-01T18:09:32Z","updated_at":"2015-02-04T09:12:10Z","closed_at":"2015-02-04T04:27:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/5347","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5347","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5347.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5347.patch"},"body":"Using 0.175.0 on Mac OS X 10.10.2 (though likely affecting all platforms), the indent guides are missing on whitespace only lines.

The only catch is the icons weren't actually being placed in that path yet. This pull request solves that issue. :smile:\n\nAs an added bonus, this pull request replaces a hardcoded path in the atom.spec.in file that pointed to the default build location (\"/tmp/atom-build\").
