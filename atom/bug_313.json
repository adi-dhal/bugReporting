ae4f7f6170da83c786ba06235f0997e52e806b10, a global autoscroll suppression mechanism was removed in favour of a per-call `autoscroll` option.\n\nIn vim-mode, motions get combined with operations, and the _yank_ operation which copies text into clipboard should not always scroll around. However, there currently seems to be no way of preventing generic cursor movements from autoscrolling.\n\n@nathansobo suggested adding the `autoscroll` option in the various movement methods, so I'm looking at this. It seems it will require that every method that may move the cursors to accept and pass through an options parameter; that feels like an unnecessarily wide-reaching contract, which affects not only methods in Atom core, but also in any package that has actions that can move the cursor.\n\nFurther, some methods like `Selection.selectLine` and `Selection.insertText` currently simply assume `autoscroll` should be true, and all places like this would need to be revisited.\n\n@nathansobo and @maxbrunsfeld - there was a `Editor.suppressAutoscroll` option in the code, introduced in 99c437ccecff469d2fc4ba70ff3ff9a0f694f9e6 and removed again in ae4f7f6170da83c786ba06235f0997e52e806b10 - can you please clarify the reasoning there? I'm sure I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, is there a public API for getting and setting the current scroll position of the window?
