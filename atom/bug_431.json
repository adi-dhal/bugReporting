This worked well, except we didn't end up autoscrolling when\nthe user _attempted_ to move the cursor to an invalid position, such as\nmoving down at the end of the buffer, due to the fact that the marker\nwouldn't change.\n\nThen, we moved to always requesting an autoscroll whenever a position\nchange was requested via Cursor::changePosition. This missed out on\nmoving the cursor when inserting text, so we then also added an explicit\nautoscroll call when inserting text.\n\nThis had the problem of not autoscrolling due to undo. So finally, this\nsolution combines explicit autoscroll in ::changePosition to capture\nintent, as well as implicit autoscrolling whenever the cursor's marker\nposition changes due to a textual change in the buffer. This captures\nundo/redo correctly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2851/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2850","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2850/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2850/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2850/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2850","id":37307628,"number":2850,"title":"Account

guys,\n\nI am working on a laptop with a high DPI screen (Sony Vaio Pro 13, 1920x1080 resolution,166 PPI), and many programs that don't cater for it will be automatically scaled up by Windows (and assume other OS's as well?).\n\nHere's what that looks like on Win8.1 build, with the example of pane titles:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7287076/3486263/8f0c2d54-042b-11e4-9ab2-532ee799f781.png)\n\nNow, of course I can turn the scaling off in the atom.exe compatibility settings which makes the typography much smaller though, and I wanted to log this issue anyway, in case someone knows what to do about it in core.\n\nAlso, note that the tree view does not suffer from this, nor the actual code in the editor panes, btw.\n\nCheers\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2833/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2832","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2832/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2832/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2832/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2832","id":37194496,"number":2832,"title":"The
