Of course, the expectation is that I run other applications on my laptop as well.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Run Atom\n2. Check the Activity Monitor for RAM usage of the Helpers.\n\n**Expected behavior:** Atom runs smoothly.\n\n**Actual behavior:** Atom eats up all my RAM and hangs.\n### Versions\n\nYou can get this information from executing `atom --version` and `apm --version` at the command line. Also, please include the OS and what version of the OS you're running.\n\nAtom : 1.6.2\nMac OSX: 10.10.5\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11423/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11422","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11422/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11422/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11422/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11422","id":147274598,"number":11422,"title":"dialog boxes","user":{"login":"cmdpwnd","id":12128257,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/12128257?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmdpwnd","html_url":"https://github.com/cmdpwnd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmdpwnd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmdpwnd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmdpwnd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmdpwnd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmdpwnd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmdpwnd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmdpwnd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmdpwnd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmdpwnd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-04-10T22:29:21Z","updated_at":"2016-04-11T00:29:28Z","closed_at":"2016-04-11T00:29:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"to improve speed and efficiency and continuity, dialog boxes such as those in which a user is prompted to delete a file should have standard Yes or No options which are accessible via the keyboard.

Even starting with --safe mode _at least_ shows those errors once or twice.\n\n![1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/760112/14395989/a89987f4-fdf2-11e5-8845-150b6e83fede.png)\n![2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/760112/14395988/a8998204-fdf2-11e5-8aa8-66292e7de802.png)\n\nThis is happening with the latest version of atom also (I can remember it happening significant number of times since 1.6.0). My project is about 1100 files in the `src` folder. It also has `node_modules`, `webpack` temp files, etc, but they are already in the ignore list.\n\nI suspect it's due to the tree-view plugin, which causes atom to lock up every now and then when I expand/collapse a folder, and generally makes atom very sluggish.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open a project with 1000+ files in atom\n2. Wait forever to edit\n3. ![2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/760112/14395988/a8998204-fdf2-11e5-8aa8-66292e7de802.png)\n4. Click **Close Window** and try again.\n\n**Expected behavior:** Atom shouldn't freeze so much.\n\n**Actual behavior:** Sublime works smoothly. Atom should atleast let me edit the files.\n### Versions\n\nVersion: 1.6.2 (1.6.0+)\nOS: Windows 10 x64\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11411/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11410","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11410/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11410/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11410/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11410","id":147024835,"number":11410,"title":"Use #index instead of #openIndex.","user":{"login":"joshaber","id":13760,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/13760?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber","html_url":"https://github.com/joshaber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-04-08T19:58:30Z","updated_at":"2016-04-08T20:41:36Z","closed_at":"2016-04-08T20:41:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/11410","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11410","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11410.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11410.patch"},"body":"# openIndex is going away: https://github.com/nodegit/nodegit/pull/989\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11409","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11409/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11409/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11409/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11409","id":146996695,"number":11409,"title":"Using the treefile \"New file\" in a keyboard shortcut, it's really powerful","user":{"login":"martiuh","id":12422855,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/12422855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martiuh","html_url":"https://github.com/martiuh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martiuh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martiuh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martiuh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martiuh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martiuh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martiuh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martiuh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martiuh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martiuh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":225560994,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/feedback","name":"feedback","color":"fbca04","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-04-08T18:03:08Z","updated_at":"2016-04-08T23:09:55Z","closed_at":"2016-04-08T22:41:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Instead of using the cmd + n (to open new file) and cmd + s (to save for the first time).

Description\n\nHow to restore corrupted file after power outage.\n\nThis has happened three times in the past half year and now really disappointed (to say the least, sorry). But this is not the behaviour I expect from a quality editor. Cannot find via Google or issues in GitHub how to resolve this.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Edit a file\n2. Laptop runs out of battery power\n3. Power laptop and restart system\n4. Open file which is now corrupted and looking like �6G�-���L����T�T�8L��\u0002s#]�Ϩ\u0010\u0003���8L��\u0002s#]�Ϩ\u0010\u0003��� etc\n\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]\n\nThat the file is never corrupted after a power cycle or the corrupted file is restorable. An editort should **never** be alowed to have this behaviour. At the moment of the power cycle I was not saving, only typing.\n\nIs there any tool to run and get my original file back?\n\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\n\nI ended up with a corrupted file as described above.\n### Versions\n\nUp to date Ubuntu 15.10 with\n$ atom --version\n1.6.2\n$ apm --version\napm  1.6.0\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.10\ngit

Some open questions I have are:\r\n- I restricted messages to URIs starting with `atom://atom` as we already [have a mechanism that utilizes URIs with hosts that match package names](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/822e0c95108aadb91631570e386d8cf96d7cfdd0/src/browser/atom-application.coffee#L550-L557) to perform some work. (What is this used for? I'm not familiar with it.) I'd love to get rid of this, as it means we can't use any host that might match a package name. If anyone has bright ideas for URI schemes, that'd be awesome. (I thought maybe something like `atom://.message/...`?)\r\n- Right now, the callback function is called with the string message (just the `namespace:name` portion) and the params, but maybe it makes more sense to pass the entire URI, or the parsed URI object.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11399/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":3,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11398","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11398/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11398/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11398/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11398","id":146658310,"number":11398,"title":"Fix build lint","user":{"login":"joshaber","id":13760,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/13760?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber","html_url":"https://github.com/joshaber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshaber/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-04-07T15:25:19Z","updated_at":"2016-04-07T15:33:54Z","closed_at":"2016-04-07T15:33:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/11398","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11398","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11398.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11398.patch"},"body":"Looks like this was introduced in https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11369. :see_no_evil:\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4084","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507404130","x-github-request-id":"B74A:366E:6FA0AB:EB3EC9:59D9294B","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=148>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=146>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"4724c2d5fd7f2dbf068c5daf73b53c62\"","status":"200 OK"}}
