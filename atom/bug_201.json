#9697.\n\nThe above issue can be consistently reproduced by switching to Dvorak and trying to open the DevTools through `Cmd-Alt-I` (which, if you have a Qwerty keyboard, is `Cmd-Alt-G`). This doesn't happen on most Qwerty keyboards and, quite oddly, I tracked down the problem to be related to DevTools being opened or closed. Indeed, if we try to replace `ApplicationDelegate::toggleWindowDevTools` with a simple log statement this problem doesn't seem to be reproducible. The reason why only certain keyboard layouts trigger this particular behavior is obscure to me at the moment, but somehow I believe this has to do with the DevTools appearing and disappearing, thereby confusing Chromium's input events. (@zcbenz: maybe you have some ideas on what's triggering this behavior?)\n\nI think this wasn't caused by a recent Electron upgrade, but rather to the way we have changed Atom DevTools interaction: in the past, this was asynchronous but it got changed to be sync during the `AtomEnvironment` refactoring. I switched back to using an asynchronous approach, so that our keybinding/commands event handlers have the chance to fully execute without waiting for DevTools to be opened/closed.\n\nI _think_ we were using a sync version because [these lines of code](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/atom-environment.coffee#L672-L674) need to be executed in succession, so that the javascript code can be run when DevTools are already open. It turns out that, before these changes, the console wasn't getting shown if DevTools were closed because we still have to wait until the `devtools-opened` event gets triggered. This PR fixes also this problem by implementing a Promise-based API on top of Electron DevTools API.\n\n/cc: @nathansobo @atom/feedback\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9788/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9787","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9787/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9787/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9787/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9787","id":118575782,"number":9787,"title":"can atom do find action when I select?","user":{"login":"tangshi","id":5255026,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5255026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangshi","html_url":"https://github.com/tangshi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangshi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangshi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangshi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangshi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangshi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangshi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangshi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangshi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangshi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true},{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-11-24T10:22:51Z","updated_at":"2015-11-24T20:23:01Z","closed_at":"2015-11-24T20:22:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"`visual studio code` automatically does `find` action when I select something and highlight all found result in both editor window and mini map.\n\nThis is such a powerful feature that I really love it.

The issue is that when a package with an older version of the library loads it before a package asking for a newer version loads, the older version is used instead.\n\nFor example:\n`linter-js-yaml` had version 3.3.7 installed of `atom-linter`, which is perfectly fine for its asked for version of `\"^3.3.7\"`. When testing `linter-php` which had `\"^3.3.9\"` specified in its package.json however, I was getting errors that had been fixed in 3.3.8 and checking the trace it showed that it was using the 3.3.7 from `linter-js-yaml`'s installation.\n\nAccording to [semver's definiton of caret ranges](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#caret-ranges-1-2-3-0-2-5-0-0-4) a request for `\"^3.3.9\"` should be equivalent to `\">=3.3.9 <4.0.0\"`, but Atom is loading `3.3.7` which does not fall within that range.\n\nI've been seeing this on Windows 10 x64, on Atom 1.3.0-beta6. (And older versions of each before in the past).\nI think I've seen it before on Ubuntu, but can't verify that at the moment.\n\nIf this has already been reported please point me in the right direction as I could not find it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9775/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9774","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9774/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9774/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9774/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9774","id":118501364,"number":9774,"title":"Mac OSX - \"open with\" context menu has all (previous) versions of Atom installed","user":{"login":"Patryk1098","id":2947116,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2947116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Patryk1098","html_url":"https://github.com/Patryk1098","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Patryk1098/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Patryk1098/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Patryk1098/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Patryk1098/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Patryk1098/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Patryk1098/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Patryk1098/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Patryk1098/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Patryk1098/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":12,"created_at":"2015-11-23T23:54:47Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T15:37:59Z","closed_at":"2015-11-24T00:00:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Right-clicking on a file within Finder and selecting \"Open With...\" shows a sub-menu of suggested applications.
