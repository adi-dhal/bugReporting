Originally detected on Atom 1.12.7. Not tested on earlier versions.\r\n\r\nWhile running specs on a package I am developing, the text in the call stack is unreadable due to the background color for `pre` being set to `#31363f` and the text color being set in `.stack-trace` to `#666`. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Spec Suite window does not appear to honor Theme changes or settings in `~/.atom/styles.less`.\r\n\r\n#### Screenshot\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/619697/21777258/1a679748-d66c-11e6-8343-87fef0ba5725.png)\r\n\r\nUsing Developer Tools, the computed value `#31363f` for `background-color` for `pre` is purportedly set in `atom.less`. The text `color`  `#666` is being set by `.stack-trace` as an embedded style sheet.\r\n\r\nWHAT I HAVE TRIED:\r\n\r\nRun in safe mode. No change.\r\n\r\nI edited the color of `.stack-trace` in `~/.atom/styles.less` to the following:\r\n\r\n```css\r\npre.stack-trace {\r\n    background-color: white;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso tried:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.stack-trace {\r\n    background-color: white;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```css\r\npre {\r\n    background-color: white;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is no effect to the Spec Suite window.\r\n\r\nTried changing themes. No changes to Spec Suite window. Attempted Theme combinations:\r\n\r\nUI Themes:\r\n- Atom Dark\r\n- Atom Light\r\n- One Dark\r\n- One Light\r\n\r\nSyntax Themes:\r\n- Atom Dark\r\n- Atom Light\r\n- One Light\r\n- Solarized Light\r\n\r\nSince there was no observable difference in the Spec Suite window from any of the above changes, I abandoned this route.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Run Specs with an error so as to display call stack\r\n2. Display of call stack is unreadable due to lack of color contrast\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\n\r\nEITHER:\r\n\r\n- Colors should have contrast OR \r\n- Spec Suite window should honor style overrides in `~/.atom/styles.less`.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/619697/21777258/1a679748-d66c-11e6-8343-87fef0ba5725.png)\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\n\r\n100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nYou can get this information from copy and pasting the output of `atom --version` and `apm --version` from the command line.

I have met the other prerequisites.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen a UI or syntax theme which uses a Less file that contains an [optional import](http://lesscss.org/features/#import-options-optional) is selected, the Less file in question fails to parse and the theme fails to activate.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Clone [atom-community/ui-theme-template](https://github.com/atom-community/ui-theme-template).\r\n2. In `index.less`, change `@import \"styles/ui-variables\";` to `@import (optional) \"styles/ui-variables\";`.\r\n3. Run `apm link` in the root of the repository.\r\n4. Navigate to the themes section of the settings screen and select \"Ui Theme Template\" from the UI themes dropdown list.\r\n\r\nIt also reproduces with syntax themes.\r\n\r\n1. Generate a syntax theme using `package-generator:generate-syntax-theme` from [atom/package-generator](https://github.com/atom/package-generator).\r\n2. In `index.less`, change `@import \"./styles/base.less\";` to `@import (optional) \"./styles/base.less\";`.\r\n3. Navigate to the themes section of the settings screen and select the generated theme from the syntax themes dropdown list.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** The theme activates successfully.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** The theme fails to activate, and a \"Error compiling Less stylesheet\" notification message is displayed with the message \"expected ')' got 'o'\".\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Every time.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.12.9\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Windows [Version 10.0.14393]\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nAttempting to use an import option that Less does not support (e.g. foobar) yields an error message of the same format e.g. expected ')' got 'f'. [According to the Less changelog](https://github.com/less/less.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#230), optional imports were added in 2.3. At current, [less-cache uses 2.7.1](https://github.com/atom/less-cache/blob/v0.24.0/package.json#L31). I have tested Less 2.7.1 separately, and optional imports parsed without error. Less' other import options seem to parse in themes without any issue.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13569/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13568","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13568/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13568/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13568/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13568","id":199400164,"number":13568,"title":"Data loss when exiting Atom with unsaved files","user":{"login":"JDougherty","id":579720,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/579720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JDougherty","html_url":"https://github.com/JDougherty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JDougherty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JDougherty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JDougherty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JDougherty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JDougherty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JDougherty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JDougherty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JDougherty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JDougherty/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-01-08T03:21:33Z","updated_at":"2017-01-08T17:16:52Z","closed_at":"2017-01-08T17:16:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen exiting Atom with one or more unsaved files, there is no confirmation to exit without saving, and the content of any unsaved files is completely lost. \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

displayed on the title bar, making it look like the open file is actually part of the first project folder in the list.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open Atom on a macOS machine\r\n2. Add some project folders if none exist\r\n3. Using finder, open a file outside of any project folder currently added\r\n4. Note that the file path displayed in the title bar points to the first project folder in the list, not the actual file location.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Opening any file in Atom displays the correct path to the file, always.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Opening a file that is not part of an 'added' project folder displays an incorrect path to the file in the title bar.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.12.7\r\n\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\n\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\n\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nSee screenshot - the  correct path to ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md is displayed in the status bar (\\~/Desktop), but not in the title bar (\\~/Projects/node-steam)\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/901721/21746316/6b5e94f4-d594-11e6-98c1-1a4f319c84e0.png)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13566/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13565","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13565/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13565/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13565/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13565","id":199362525,"number":13565,"title":"Preserve --disable-gpu flag on Atom restart","user":{"login":"mmarinero","id":475969,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/475969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmarinero","html_url":"https://github.com/mmarinero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmarinero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmarinero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmarinero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmarinero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmarinero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmarinero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmarinero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmarinero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmarinero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":505038679,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-01-07T13:45:05Z","updated_at":"2017-08-13T19:48:05Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

The window opened second seems to be a second-class citizen and does not behave as a user of other editors (e.g. Sublime, TextWrangler, Notepad++, etc) might expect.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if you drag-and-drop a file from Finder into Atom, it opens in a new tab. This is great, except if we drag to the Secondary window. This will open the file in the Primary window, which is Not Good. This scenario is our main issue, however there are two more issues which exacerbate the problem:\r\n\r\n- One is unable to open the Tree View in the Secondary window. Selecting the menu option or using the keyboard shortcut does nothing. So, the Main issue cannot be circumvented in this way.\r\n\r\n- Dragging a tab from the Primary window to the Secondary window creates a duplicate of the tab. This would be neat if both buffers were updated simultaneously, but since they are not, it ends up being confusing, and therefore results in the extra step of having to close the first tab.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open the Atom editor\r\n2. Open a New Window (you will now have two distinct windows)\r\n3. Drag a file into the window created second\r\n4. The file will appear in the first window\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** The file should appear in the window targeted by the user, and nowhere else.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** The file appears in the first window created, no matter what. Other issues, as described above, make this more annoying than it might otherwise be.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100% - Always\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nmacOS 10.12.2 - Atom 1.12.8\r\nWindows 10 v1607 - Atom 1.12.9\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduced on a clean install of Atom, with no additional configuration or packages.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13558/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13557","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13557/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13557/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13557/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13557","id":199224508,"number":13557,"title":"Simple, test scrolling is WAY TO sensible and fast.

Clone [atom-community/ui-theme-template](https://github.com/atom-community/ui-theme-template).\r\n2. Append `#` on a new line to `styles/ui-variables.less`. Alternatively, `@foo: @bar;` can be appended, where `@bar` is undefined. This also reproduces the issue. \r\n3. Run `apm link --dev` in the root of the repository.\r\n4. Open Atom in developer mode (`atom --dev`), navigate to the themes section of the settings screen, and select \"Ui Theme Template\" from the UI themes dropdown list.\r\n5. Reload Atom in developer mode (I tried both `ctrl + alt + r`, and simply closing Atom and re-opening it with `atom --dev`).\r\n\r\nI have only reproduced the problem in developer mode. I have not attempted to reproduce the problem in Atom's normal mode, as I fear being unable to reverse it.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** The editor loads.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** The editor does not load, and the window remains an empty white box. The Chromium developer tools automatically open to the console.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Every time.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.12.9\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  :
