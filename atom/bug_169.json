Here's the first assumption: a tab is defined by the column it ends at, not the column is starts at.

The first character is there to 'fill the gaps'\n2. The second character is necessarily put at the end.\n\nThus, if the tab is 5 characters long and you set the two characters to '-' and '>' respectively, it would display as '---->'.

After updating some packages (see https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9974) to use these new fields, I realized that it was somewhat awkward to specify deserializers and view providers in separate files from the packages's main module. I think it is better if these fields work similarly to `consumedServices` and `providedServices`, by specifying names of methods on the package's main module.\n#### Example\n\n`package.json`\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-package\",\n  \"main\": \"index\",\n  \"deserializers\": {\n    \"MyObject\": \"deserializeMyObject\"\n  },\n  \"viewProviders\": [\n    \"buildMyObjectView\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n`index.js`\n\n``` js\nconst MyObject = require('./my-object')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  activate () {\n    // ...\n  },\n\n  deserializeMyObject (state) {\n    return new MyObject(state)\n  },\n\n  buildMyObjectView (model) {\n    if (model instanceof MyObject) {\n      return new MyObjectView\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n#### Advantages\n- This approach is more consistent with `consumedServices` and `providedServices`, which seem to be working well for a variety of use cases.\n- Many packages currently maintain singleton instances of some view or model object, and keep a reference to it in their main module. This makes it easier for view providers and deserializers to create or update that singleton instance. The alternative would be for the instance to be stored as a global variable in the deserializer file, or in some third file that is required by both the main module and the deserializer.\n- Similarly, this allows the deserializer to interact with any of the package's consumed or provided services with less boilerplate.\n- Overall, I like the idea of the package's main module being the only file that needs global state, and all other files in the package exporting classes or functions.\n#### Drawbacks\n- The main module will be required earlier now, for packages that either 1) have view providers, or 2) have deserializers that are needed immediately. But _some_ code file would have to be required under these conditions regardless, so I think as long as the main module defers its requires effectively, it shouldn't make any difference in terms of load time.\n\n/cc @atom/core\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10764/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10763","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10763/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10763/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10763/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10763","id":132838167,"number":10763,"title":"Allow Users to Consent to Metrics Data Collection Before Collecting Data","user":{"login":"Buddybenj","id":8868182,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8868182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buddybenj","html_url":"https://github.com/Buddybenj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buddybenj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buddybenj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buddybenj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buddybenj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buddybenj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buddybenj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buddybenj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buddybenj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Buddybenj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true},{"id":225560994,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/feedback","name":"feedback","color":"fbca04","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-02-10T22:42:04Z","updated_at":"2016-02-10T23:42:38Z","closed_at":"2016-02-10T22:55:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The only thing holding me back from using this editor is the creepy data collection which is not even made clear to the user.

#10648.\n\nSo this fix is a little fussy.\n1. Ideally we’d simply update the window load settings with the window dimensions before we reload, so that the reloaded window has the same dimensions.\n2. **But** any changes we make to the window load settings in our `beforeunload` handler aren’t reflected in the reload. (I suspect Chromium’s grabbing the location for reload before calling the handler?)\n3. So the next best thing: we detect a reload before `beforeunload` is called and update the window load settings there. This worked for _most_ reloads but I wasn’t able to find a hook for reloads triggered by cmd-r with the dev tools focused. That inconsistency would have been super annoying, to me at least.\n4. So instead we track whether this is the first time the window’s been loaded. If it is, we use the default dimensions. If it isn’t, we use the dimensions we’re already saving in state.\n\n@atom/core I’m curious if I’ve totally overcomplicated this or missed anything obvious.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10742","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10742/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10742/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10742/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10742","id":132396503,"number":10742,"title":"Atom fails to build on ARM Linux 32bit","user":{"login":"cnshenyi","id":1064248,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1064248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnshenyi","html_url":"https://github.com/cnshenyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnshenyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnshenyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnshenyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnshenyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnshenyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnshenyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnshenyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnshenyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnshenyi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2016-02-09T11:32:24Z","updated_at":"2016-06-21T15:27:30Z","closed_at":"2016-06-21T15:27:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I tried to build it on a arm chromebook asus c201, it's a armv7 platform.

The main function I added is `activateNextRecentlyUsedItem` which walks down the `itemStack` each time the user hits tab after ctrl is held down.\n\nI set up the keymap for ctrl-tab but I still don't have the keymaps figured out for when ctrl is held down and tab is pressed over and over before lifting up on ctrl.  Something else I need to figure out is how to call a specific function to move an item to the top of the stack once ctrl is lifted.  \n\nSo, based on the assumption that I can make a keymap for holding down ctrl and pressing tab over and over (suggestions are welcome), I set up my code so that `activateNextRecentlyUsedItem` would be called each time the user hits tab when holding down ctrl.  Each call to this function would walk down the `itemStack`.  When the user lifted the ctrl key, somehow we would need to call `moveItemToTopOfStack` which would move the item the user stopped on to the top of the stack.\n\nI modified the serialization, too, so the `itemStack` would persist.  The 4 scenarios I was focusing on are:\n- nothing is wrong\n- no `itemStack` serialized\n- some items not serialized\n- for some reason there is a different number of items in the `itemStack` than in the `items` array\n\nI wrote tests for the MRU functionality and for the different serialization scenarios.\n\nSo yeah, this won't work correctly until I can figure out the key maps for holding ctrl down and hitting tab more than once and until I can figure out how to call `moveItemToTopOfStack` when ctrl is lifted.  \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10737/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":3,"-1":7,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10736","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10736/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10736/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10736/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10736","id":132339245,"number":10736,"title":"Tabs to Spaces screws up middle indentation","user":{"login":"alexchandel","id":637714,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/637714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel","html_url":"https://github.com/alexchandel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-02-09T06:05:05Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T21:08:28Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T21:08:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Consider this line, in Atom 1.4.3 with a tabLength of 8:\n\n``` lisp\n(E100_C     (dP -0.1)   (dT 100))\n```\n\nUsing the Tabs to Spaces command should produce 9 spaces for the two consecutive tabs.
