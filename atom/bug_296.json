It took me long time to figure out the correct setting. Some settings have a small explanatory sentence. Would you consider including one for softWrap?\n\nMany thanks\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6920/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6919","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6919/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6919/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6919/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/6919","id":79691754,"number":6919,"title":"Fix application:open-license command","user":{"login":"mnquintana","id":823545,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/823545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana","html_url":"https://github.com/mnquintana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722948,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-review","name":"needs-review","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-05-23T02:13:35Z","updated_at":"2015-05-26T16:14:05Z","closed_at":"2015-05-26T16:14:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/6919","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/6919","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/6919.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/6919.patch"},"body":"Fixes https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6918\n\nThe issue here was that `atom.getLoadSettings().resourcePath` was returning the path to `app.asar`, but the LICENSE.md currently doesn't get placed inside `app.asar` – it lives directly inside the resources directory. This gets around that by using `process.resourcesPath` like https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/browser/atom-application.coffee#L210, but this probably isn't the best approach since `process.resourcePath` won't change if you launched Atom normally but have a dev mode window active.\n- Should we generate LICENSE.md inside `app.asar`?\n\n/cc @atom/feedback @kevinsawicki \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6919/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6918","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6918/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6918/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6918/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6918","id":79679454,"number":6918,"title":"Uncaught Error: ENOENT, LICENSE.md not found in C:\\Users\\Ian\\AppData\\Local\\atom\\app-0.201.0\\resources\\app.asar","user":{"login":"iangcarroll","id":1280719,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1280719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iangcarroll","html_url":"https://github.com/iangcarroll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iangcarroll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iangcarroll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iangcarroll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iangcarroll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iangcarroll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iangcarroll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iangcarroll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iangcarroll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iangcarroll/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":211058624,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/uncaught-exception","name":"uncaught-exception","color":"e11d21","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"mnquintana","id":823545,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/823545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana","html_url":"https://github.com/mnquintana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mnquintana","id":823545,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/823545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana","html_url":"https://github.com/mnquintana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mnquintana/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-05-23T01:17:17Z","updated_at":"2015-05-26T16:14:04Z","closed_at":"2015-05-26T16:14:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"1.

It appears loose inside the meta span for the key-pair.\n\nNow if we look at the pattern in question:\n\n```\n  {\n    'begin': '^\\\\s*(([\\\\S&&[^:=\\\\\\\\]]|\\\\\\\\.)+)\\\\s*([:=])?'\n    'beginCaptures':\n      '1':\n        'name': 'support.constant.java-properties'\n        'patterns': [\n          {\n            'match': '\\\\\\\\([tnfr\"\\'\\\\\\\\ ]|u\\\\h{4})'\n

}\n```\n\nFrom my understanding, this pattern should be applying class _support.constant.java-properties_ to the property key.\n\nNow, if I remove the nested patterns, it renders how I would expect:\n\n![screenshot 2015-05-22 08 02 21](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2270905/7770210/e3f09a64-0059-11e5-830f-91cb7ed2652d.png)\n\nThe key now has its own span with the appropriate
