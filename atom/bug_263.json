The snippets worked perfectly on Mac OS X using that scope, but they did not work at all on Windows.

I have a Mac Book Pro with 16GB I can run Photoshop, IDE, two browsers with multiple tabs and I don't see any performance issue, but if I open Atom with 2 browser it lags and performance is really bad.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7912/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7911","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7911/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7911/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7911/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7911","id":95195706,"number":7911,"title":"Atom doesn't take focus when file is opened on opened window.","user":{"login":"envygeeks","id":99763,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/99763?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/envygeeks","html_url":"https://github.com/envygeeks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envygeeks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envygeeks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envygeeks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envygeeks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envygeeks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envygeeks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envygeeks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envygeeks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/envygeeks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2015-07-15T13:34:05Z","updated_at":"2015-11-22T21:38:46Z","closed_at":"2015-07-15T13:35:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"On Linux (Ubuntu 14.04 - both Unity and GNOME) Atom does not ask my system for focus when a new file is opened on a previously opened file, this could be related to the fact that we split our dev across multiple desktops across multiple screens but ultimately it never even asks for focus.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7911/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7910","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7910/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7910/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7910/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7910","id":95179078,"number":7910,"title":"Uncaught Error: Encountered an invalid scope end id.

https://github.com/atom/one-dark-ui/issues/82, @wiox noticed that sub-pixel anti aliasing is not only disabled for the tabs, but also on the fuzzy finder and the status bar.\n\n![sub-pixel](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378023/8694250/9299865a-2b18-11e5-8f8d-936466ccedf6.png)\n\nIt seems it's caused by the line number tiles getting promoted to a GPU layer and probably related to #7101. Kinda strange that it affects different areas.\n\nSomething that might be worth looking into is using `will-change`. It also adds a GPU layer for the line numbers, but doesn't affect the rest. Notice the orange \"composited layer borders\" only appear in the status bar with `-webkit-transform: translate3d(0px, 0px, 0px);` but not with `will-change: transform;`.\n\n![tiles](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378023/8694309/0dae2350-2b19-11e5-8506-7201ba42ae5e.gif)\n\nNow, I _heard_ that `will-change` should only be used when interacting, like on hover or so.. and not kept permanently enabled. So not sure if that would help. /cc @as-cii @nathansobo \n\n**Edit:** Sorry, I just realized that the `transform` is needed to actually move line numbers. So can't be replaced. :grin:\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7903","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7903/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7903/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7903/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7903","id":95130830,"number":7903,"title":"Sidebar menu: add a \"Copy Relative Path\" item?","user":{"login":"jpetitcolas","id":688373,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/688373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpetitcolas","html_url":"https://github.com/jpetitcolas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpetitcolas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpetitcolas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpetitcolas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpetitcolas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpetitcolas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpetitcolas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpetitcolas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpetitcolas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpetitcolas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-07-15T08:06:53Z","updated_at":"2015-07-15T11:55:05Z","closed_at":"2015-07-15T10:51:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When right-clicking on a file in the sidebar, we already have:\n- Copy Full Path\n- Copy Project Path\n\nWhat about adding a `Copy Relative Path` item, which would copy a path relative to current open file?
