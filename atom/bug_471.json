It'd be nice if this happened right in the file tree (on the file itself) and didn't require an enter press.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1636","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1636/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1636/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1636/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/1636","id":28539974,"number":1636,"title":"Open last project on startup","user":{"login":"cameronmcefee","id":72919,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/72919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronmcefee","html_url":"https://github.com/cameronmcefee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronmcefee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronmcefee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronmcefee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronmcefee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronmcefee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronmcefee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronmcefee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronmcefee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronmcefee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-02-28T22:54:36Z","updated_at":"2014-05-03T19:01:56Z","closed_at":"2014-03-11T19:30:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"When you quit sublime with a project open, the next time you launch it that project is opened automatically.

I can't write CTRL-\", because it writes the number \"2\" instead.
