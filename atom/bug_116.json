The problem seems to only occur if there is no scrollbar present. When trying to achieve the same result when there is already a scrollbar visible, it will work fine.\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Open Atom in safe mode\r\n1. Open a new untitled tab\r\n1. Paste the contents of  [this file](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Ben3eeE/6b9a8d5c3fbdd38bda3b70b63617b280/raw/77e0fc174f27160e82bd3c27f2d8182771770fb8/gistfile1.txt) in to the new untitled tab.\r\n1. **Expected:** Scrollbar to be at the bottom since the TextEditor is scrolled to the  bottom. **Acutal:** Scrollbar stays at the top of the file. This bug applies to both vertical and horizontal scrollbars.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** \r\n\r\nThe scrollbar should appear and then indicate that the view has been scrolled.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** \r\n\r\nThe scrollbar didn't indicate that the site was scrolled. It stayed at its initial position on the left.\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.9.5\r\nElectron: 0.37.8\r\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\r\nNode    : 5.10.0\r\nmacOS/OSX El Capitan\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12355/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12354","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12354/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12354/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12354/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12354","id":169792540,"number":12354,"title":"Cannot invalidate block decoration","user":{"login":"deprint","id":7817714,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7817714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deprint","html_url":"https://github.com/deprint","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deprint/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deprint/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deprint/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deprint/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deprint/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deprint/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deprint/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deprint/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deprint/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-08-07T11:42:24Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T19:10:24Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T19:10:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Prerequisites:**\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n\n**Description:**\n\nI want to remove a block decoration by invalidating its marker.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n- Contents of `init.coffee`:\n\n``` coffee\natom.workspace.open().then (editor) ->\n  editor.setText(\"hello world\\nhello, world!\\nHello, world!\\nHello world!\\n\")\n  linemarker = editor.markBufferRange([[2,0], [2, 9999]], invalidate: 'touch')\n  blokmarker = editor.markBufferRange([[2,0], [2, 9999]], invalidate: 'touch')\n  div = document.createElement 'div'\n  div.className = 'text-error'\n  div.appendChild document.createTextNode(\"hello World!\")\n  linedecoration = editor.decorateMarker(linemarker, type: 'line', class: 'line-green')\n  blokdecoration = editor.decorateMarker(blokmarker, type: 'block', item: div)\n```\n- Contents of `styles.less`:\n\n``` less\natom-text-editor::shadow {\n  .line.line-green {\n    background-color: rgba(0, 144, 0, 0.2) !important;\n  }\n}\n```\n1. `window:reload`.\n2.

However, I strongly suspect (from almost 2 years of issue triage experience) that it gives users the sense that Atom is wildly unstable.\n\nThis can be exacerbated by Atom's hackability – since a package can literally do anything, there is nothing preventing a community package from completely disrupting a user's workflow by throwing exceptions left and right (and this isn't hypothetical, either – there are definitely some packages well known for making Atom \"feel\" unstable). This also increases our issue triage burden, because we often get reports of issues that are ultimately caused by community packages.\n\nCompare this with any other production desktop app – how many of them burden their users with taking action on mere uncaught exceptions? With the exception of hard crashes, there's no reason why any of these necessarily should require manual user action.\n\nI think users on Atom's stable channel reasonably expect Atom to feel, err, stable 😆 , and we should do all that we can to make their lives simpler, more pleasant, and more productive. Beta users, on the other hand, have explicitly opted-in to testing a more experimental, potentially unstable Atom.\n## Proposal 🎉\n\nOn the `stable` channel, just log uncaught exceptions silently instead of popping up a notification (and send to Bugsnag, if they've opted-in to telemetry). On `beta`, keep the current behavior, but in addition to this revamped logging.\n\nPersist these logs to disk and provide a command to open issues with those logs attached.\n## Considerations 💭\n1. We would lose a large sample set for discovering uncaught exceptions – what if we miss some?\n2. Uncaught exceptions and stack traces in themselves are rarely, if ever, enough information to properly diagnose a bug. This is why the notifications package currently attaches the most recent commands entered, the user's config, and their installed packages, and encourages users to describe reproduction steps. How would we get the information we need to debug uncaught exceptions without making users open issues on GitHub for them?\n3. Packages might be explicitly using the `atom.notifications` API to pop open errors, even though it's still private. Should we prevent this in the stable channel (but only for error-type notifications)?\n### Potential Solutions 🚀\n1. This shouldn't matter – our beta channel exists for this exact purpose. We shouldn't treat users on stable like beta users.\n2. We should set up robust logs for all registered Atom commands, and persist these logs to disk. (cf. https://github.com/winstonjs/winston).\n\nWhat do you think? :eyes: @iolsen @lee-dohm @atom/feedback \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12343/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12342","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12342/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12342/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12342/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12342","id":169675544,"number":12342,"title":"Don't delete package metadata during package slug compilation","user":{"login":"nathansobo","id":1789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo","html_url":"https://github.com/nathansobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-08-05T19:07:21Z","updated_at":"2016-08-08T19:35:26Z","closed_at":"2016-08-08T19:35:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/12342","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12342","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12342.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12342.patch"},"body":"This saves space, but leads to surprises when package code tries to read these files for purposes of introspection.

This is most likely related to this Chromium bug: [https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=588434](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=588434). This bug is fixed in newer versions of Chromium. This could be fixed by upgrading electron.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Use a plugin which places a canvas in the editor view.\n2. Launch atom, switch spaces on OS X, switch back.\n3. Try this a few times if the bug doesn't occur right away.\n\n**Expected behavior:** the canvas should still be there when you switch spaces back.\n\n**Actual behavior:** the canvas is rendered as a white element, no matter what `background-color` it is given, and no matter what CSS transformations are applied to it.\n\n**EDIT:** it was white in my editor because I use a white theme. The canvas appears to become a solid color that matches the editor's background color (probably takes the pixel buffer from the thing behind it). I know it's not just transparent, because I can move the canvas above the text and the text is clearly covered by something of a solid color.\n### Versions\n\n```\nAtom    : 1.9.4\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\n```\n\nNote how old that version of Chrome and Electron are. The [Chromium bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=588434) I linked above was present in Chrome 49.
