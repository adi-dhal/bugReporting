In the case of Atom's text editor, it's worth the effort to avoid this overhead by hand coding all DOM updates. The update code is repetitive, but it's also pretty straightforward. In exchange, we get much simpler profile traces, drop a big dependency, and reduce the overall number of moving parts in Atom. Below are some flame graphs for entering a character at the end of a syntax-highlighted line. The comparison is somewhat unfair because the React case _could_ have been a bit more optimized, but I think the pictures also show how much simpler the manual approach is in our case.\n\n![screenshot_2015-02-18_15_03_39](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1789/6257760/3205780a-b780-11e4-9399-94d2ded8f0a4.png)\n\n![screenshot_2015-02-18_15_01_42](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1789/6257801/6ad79938-b780-11e4-9bde-226ab9b986ba.png)\n\nReact is a great tool for many cases, for our particular needs in this particular case I decided it would be easier to just do things for ourselves.\n### Remaining Tasks:\n- [x] Don't use React for EditorComponent\n- [x] Fix autocomplete spec.\n- [x] Unify DOM updates / polling across editors.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5624/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":5}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5623","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5623/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5623/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5623/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5623","id":58134846,"number":5623,"title":"Add \"Checking for Update\" to menu","user":{"login":"brendannee","id":96217,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/96217?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendannee","html_url":"https://github.com/brendannee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendannee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendannee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendannee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendannee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendannee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendannee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendannee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendannee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brendannee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-02-18T21:57:49Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T23:18:45Z","closed_at":"2015-02-19T23:18:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/5623","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5623","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5623.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5623.patch"},"body":"When state is “checking”, menu should say “Checking for Update” instead of \"Downloading Update\".

would like to be able to build a UI and syntax theme that share a color palette (and font/misc stylistic choices).
