Due to a [bug in Chrome](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=677050) that has been resolved as of Electron 1.7, that field only contains the most recently typed character in Electron 1.6.\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to work around this on Chrome 56 by reading the contents of the hidden input field directly rather than relying on the incorrect `data` property. Since `compositionupdate` events seem to be fired prior to the contents of the input field changing, I perform the read on `process.nextTick` after the browser has a chance to update the field.\r\n\r\nOne extra wrinkle is I now *clear* the input field on `compositionstart` events so that previous input doesn't pollute the previewed composition. The only keystrokes that could potentially pollute the preview are spaces, since we use `preventDefault` in our `textInput` event handler to prevent every other character from actually being inserted. If we `preventDefault` on space however, it causes the browser's default behavior of scrolling on space, so we have to let that one through. It's okay though, because we're clearing it out when the composition starts.\r\n\r\n/cc @ungb @Ben3eeE

Atom 1.19.0, I can no longer use `Ctrl+Up` and `Ctrl+Down` to scroll using the https://github.com/callum-ramage/ctrl-dir-scroll/ plugin.\r\n\r\nBefore someone says \"go file an issue on the `ctrl-dir-scroll` project\" (note I already have: https://github.com/callum-ramage/ctrl-dir-scroll/issues/28), keep in mind that this plugin has not been modified since February of this year (almost eight months ago).\r\n\r\nIn fact Atom 1.19.0 has significant changes that break several plugins. For example https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15225 completely breaks https://github.com/Glavin001/atom-beautify , corrupting content and losing data. As far as I can tell, this was caused by changed in Atom, not by something new in the plugin; see https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15225 .\r\n\r\nI suspect this is yet another instance of significant Atom changes in 1.19.0 breaking things. If I don't report it here, then no one may ever look into it.

If one has an unsaved buffer open in a project-less window, after pressing \"restart\", the normal unsaved file dialog is presented with, on macOS at least, \"Save\", \"Don't Save\", and \"Cancel\" buttons. In this scenario, \"Save\" and \"Don't Save\" work as expected, but pressing \"Cancel\" will immediately re-present the same dialog. This can be especially problematic when the unsaved buffer is in another tab in the same window as one cannot switch tabs to inspect the file and determine if it should be saved or not.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open a new project-less window and buffer\r\n2. Type in some content\r\n3. Trigger a restart by either updating plugins or opening a developer console and entering `atom.restartApplication()`\r\n4. Press \"Cancel\"\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nThe restart operation should be canceled, returning me to the state I was in before I pressed \"restart\".\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\nI am immediately presented with the same unsaved buffer dialog\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:**\r\nEvery time\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.19.0\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  :

Been trying for 2 days now. But was such a strange problem and behavior I felt i should report it. \r\n\r\nI closed atom 2 nights ago and when I reopened it the following morning. No tabs were showing. It was just the menu. Not git browser, project tree, ect. just about everything in the menus didn't respond.  The program wasn't locked up as I could open and close the menus, but it wouldn't open the settings, packages, or even reopen my project. This is what it looked like: https://prnt.sc/g6s8yo\r\n\r\nSo I started working through the debug steps. I check to ensure i was on the latest version (1.19). \r\nI then closed it out and reopened it in safe mode. The problem was still there. I then closed it and cleared the save state and reopened it normal mode and cleared the saved state and reopened in safe mode. The problem was still there. I then closed it and moved the <user>\\.atom folder. repeating again opening in normal and safe mode. Problem continued. I checked for links and there were none. I had to skip the \"Check Atom and Package Settings\" because I was unable to open the settings or packages sections inside of atom. \r\n\r\nI restored my original <user>\\.atom folder again to check for font rendering issues. I noticed a error count in the developer window. So when I switch to the console. I saw:\r\nUncaught (in promise) Error: EOVERFLOW, Unknown error\r\nC:\\wamp64\\www\\influxproject\\html\\application\\helpers\\myform_helper.php\r\n\r\nCurious i closed Atom and reset to factory again and cleared saved state. When I open it back up and reopened the developer console. again I saw the same error. It made no since that point as to how and why it knew about that file after clearing the save state and restoring to factory default. I opened the file up in Notepad++ and turned on all symbols. I skimmed through the file looking for anything that seemed like it might not belong. I couldn't find anything. \r\n\r\nSo I closed atom and moved the file to someplace else. When i reopened atom everything was back to normal. Thinking it might just be the file it's self still. I closed atom moved the file back to where it was and reopened atom. Yet when it opened Atom was acting normally like there wasn't even a problem. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. [First Step]\r\n2. [Second Step]\r\n3.
