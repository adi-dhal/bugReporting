Here is a screenshot showing this:\n\n![alt text](https://virtual-host-discourse.global.ssl.fastly.net/uploads/github_atom/23682/5e3564883ffa487d.png)\n\nNote that the em dash should have the width of 4 spaces.\n\nBrackets fixed this in a really cool way, VIM has it also. This way, IMHO, should be how this should work:\n\nThe \"Invisibles Tab\" setting should have 2 fields. The first field is for the character that should be used to fill the space of the tab. And the second field is for the character that should finish the drawing (if any).\n\nPractical examples of this setting:\n\nExample A\nFirst character: -\nSecond character: >\nResult for 4 spaces: --->\n\nExample B\nFirst character: -\nSecond character: -\nResult for 4 spaces: ----\n\nRegards\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3051/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3050","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3050/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3050/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3050/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/3050","id":38497598,"number":3050,"title":"Add key binding for transpose to linux and win keymaps","user":{"login":"dsandstrom","id":1400414,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1400414?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsandstrom","html_url":"https://github.com/dsandstrom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsandstrom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsandstrom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsandstrom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsandstrom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsandstrom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsandstrom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsandstrom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsandstrom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsandstrom/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722964,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/requires-changes","name":"requires-changes","color":"fef2c0","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":12,"created_at":"2014-07-23T05:54:20Z","updated_at":"2016-09-29T18:57:24Z","closed_at":"2016-09-29T18:57:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/3050","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/3050","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/3050.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/3050.patch"},"body":"I choose `alt-t`, but can change to whatever if people want something different.
