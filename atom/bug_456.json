Packages pane, the updated packages in 'Available Updates' section should probably be removed once the update is done, as of 0.94.0 version, here's the following behaviour:\n- clicked update icon for package eg. fizzy\n- once update is done, the check icon appears on the top right\n- then the fizzy package stays in the update section forever or until atom is restarted\n\nAlso, the update button should be disabled once the update is in progress or done with the package update.\n\n![screen shot 2014-05-08 at 5 02 59
