#15158\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs shown in #15158, [these assertions in `spec/text-editor-component-spec.js`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/29810c6cd1924e08126bd18d759b80abfd1c199c/spec/text-editor-component-spec.js#L1462-L1463) occasionally fail on AppVeyor:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTextEditorComponent\r\n  highlight decorations\r\n    it can flash highlight decorations\r\n      Expected false to be true.\r\n        at it (C:\\projects\\atom\\spec\\text-editor-component-spec.js:1462:53)\r\n      Expected false to be true.\r\n        at it (C:\\projects\\atom\\spec\\text-editor-component-spec.js:1463:53)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI haven't been able to reproduce the failure locally, but after discussion with @nathansobo, we have a hunch regarding the source of the intermittent failures. It seems that the flash for class 'c' sometimes ends before the flash for class 'd' happens:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Flash existing highlight\r\ndecoration.flash('c', 100)\r\nawait component.getNextUpdatePromise()\r\nexpect(highlights[0].classList.contains('c')).toBe(true)\r\nexpect(highlights[1].classList.contains('c')).toBe(true)\r\n\r\n// Add second flash class\r\ndecoration.flash('d', 100)\r\nawait component.getNextUpdatePromise()\r\nexpect(highlights[0].classList.contains('c')).toBe(true) // <== occasionally fails\r\nexpect(highlights[1].classList.contains('c')).toBe(true) // <== occasionally fails\r\nexpect(highlights[0].classList.contains('d')).toBe(true)\r\nexpect(highlights[1].classList.contains('d')).toBe(true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, we only flashed class 'c' for 100ms, and perhaps that isn't always enough time. In this PR, we increase the flash duration from 100ms to 1000ms, greatly increasing the likelihood that we're allowing enough time for the flash on class 'd' to take place before the flash for class 'c' ends. (Even 1000ms doesn't _guarantee_ that we're allowing enough time, but we don't have a better solution available at the moment.)\r\n\r\nThis PR also extracts the involved assertions into their own test, so that 1) we can more clearly explain the scenario that these assertions are testing and 2) it will be easier to isolate any future intermittent test failures related to these assertions.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15169/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":1}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15168","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15168/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15168/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15168/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15168","id":248026942,"number":15168,"title":"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'id' of null","user":{"login":"TorquilChapman","id":6042659,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6042659?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TorquilChapman","html_url":"https://github.com/TorquilChapman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TorquilChapman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TorquilChapman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TorquilChapman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TorquilChapman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TorquilChapman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TorquilChapman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TorquilChapman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TorquilChapman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TorquilChapman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":211058624,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/uncaught-exception","name":"uncaught-exception","color":"e11d21","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-08-04T14:42:35Z","updated_at":"2017-08-20T09:54:22Z","closed_at":"2017-08-12T19:22:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[Enter steps to reproduce:]\r\n\r\n1.

If the modal does not have any tabbable elements, focus() will be sent to the panel's root element (if it implements it).\n\nI'm happy to update this to *always* calls focus on the panel's root element, but then modal implementers would need to handle that and focus things on their own. I'd argue the tabbable element behavior is more accessible though :)\n\nThis has the effect of not automatically closing most of Atom's own modals whenever the tab key is pressed, which was an odd nonstandard behavior, IMO.\n\nThis also automates returning focus to the element that had focus before the modal was shown, something up until now had to be implemented in every modal in Atom.\n\nThis likely breaks a few contracts for existing Atom packages that create modals, but I've found this doesn't conflict behaviorally with well-behaved modals like the command palette which implement their own focus management (which can be removed if this lands).\n\nReleased under

I think it might be a case of \"overspecification\" in the test's assertions. The test expects the blinking cursor to *start* in the visible state, and then transition to the invisible state. When we see the failure above, I suspect that the cursor has already transitioned from the visible state to the invisible state by the time the assertions run.\r\n\r\nSince the test aims to verify that the cursor blinks [1], it seems like we should focus on the blinking, and not worry about the *initial* state of the cursor. This PR removes the assertions that verify the initial state of the cursor, and instead asserts that the cursor toggles between the visible and the invisible state.\r\n\r\n@nathansobo: Given your familiarly with this test, would you mind reviewing this change? I *think* this change has a good chance of resolving the intermittent failures while still maintaining the spirit of the test.

This PR describes how to make it persistent after reboot also.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain what other alternates were considered and why the proposed version was selected -->\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nAtom displays a link to this file when file watching doesnt work as expected\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\n<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\n<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\n<!-- Enter any applicable Issues here -->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15149/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15148","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15148/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15148/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15148/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15148","id":247580606,"number":15148,"title":"Don't enable electron logging by default","user":{"login":"nathansobo","id":1789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo","html_url":"https://github.com/nathansobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-08-03T03:14:43Z","updated_at":"2017-08-03T19:27:47Z","closed_at":"2017-08-03T19:27:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/15148","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15148","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15148.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15148.patch"},"body":"@as-cii @jasonrudolph This cleans up the test noise we were seeing on our package.\r\n\r\nIn #9268, @thomasjo set the `ELECTRON_ENABLE_LOGGING` environment variable to true. He states in that PR that this was necessary to enable `console.log` to go to `stdout`, and I didn't take the time to go back and test that ancient version of Electron to confirm this to be true, but I'll take him at his word.\r\n\r\nNow, however, `console.log` seems to work irrespective of this environment variable. Furthermore setting this environment variable has the unfortunate side effect of causing lots of fairly low level warning messages from within Chromium's internals to spam the console when Atom is run headless. In this PR, I remove the lines from `atom.sh` and `atom.cmd` that set this variable. It's still possible to automatically assign the variable via the `--enable-electron-logging` flag.\r\n\r\n@damieng would you mind checking my changes in `cmd.sh` and maybe @ungb could you test it out? I just want to make sure I didn't break the script.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15148/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15147","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15147/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15147/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15147/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15147","id":247576319,"number":15147,"title":"Ensure custom gutter decoration elements fill their container","user":{"login":"nathansobo","id":1789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo","html_url":"https://github.com/nathansobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-08-03T02:41:20Z","updated_at":"2017-08-03T14:11:08Z","closed_at":"2017-08-03T14:11:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/15147","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15147","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15147.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15147.patch"},"body":"In the previous implementation of text editor rendering, [we were assigning an inline height on decoration elements](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/b580ff8642d4401892c730f6bd2e1b38bd00b3e5/src/custom-gutter-component.coffee#L104). The rewrite in #13880 accidentally dropped this behavior, which was causing empty decoration elements to be zero height and not display a background in some cases. We also drop the `width: min-content` style on the `.line-number` class, which is being used by packages to style decorations in some cases. This width setting was needed at one phase of development but doesn't appear to be needed any longer.\r\n\r\nHere is an example with `linter-ui-default` (configured with gutter decorations on the right), `nucleus-dark` UI theme, and `dracula` syntax theme.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR:\r\n![screen shot 2017-08-02 at 8 37 33 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1789/28903512-8e1e0db4-77c2-11e7-85b9-16ba71249b1a.png)\r\n\r\nAfter this PR:\r\n![screen shot 2017-08-02 at 8 38 22 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1789/28903519-934a037e-77c2-11e7-8c07-3046de154d86.png)\r\n\r\nThis needs to be hot-fixed to 1.19 before we roll the railcars.\r\n\r\n/cc @jasonrudolph ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15147/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15146","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15146/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15146/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15146/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15146","id":247541214,"number":15146,"title":"Rendering issues on MacOS","user":{"login":"jarrodek","id":3320020,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3320020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jarrodek","html_url":"https://github.com/jarrodek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jarrodek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jarrodek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jarrodek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jarrodek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jarrodek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jarrodek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jarrodek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jarrodek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jarrodek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-08-02T22:28:05Z","updated_at":"2017-08-03T00:33:48Z","closed_at":"2017-08-03T00:33:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * [x] Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * [x] Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * [x] Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * [x] Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * [x] Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nSee attached image:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3320020/28897090-012d828c-7794-11e7-8693-e4e923a3e551.png)\r\n\r\nThere are two areas of a darker background:\r\nDarker color:\r\n![color1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3320020/28897483-ca62849e-7795-11e7-8173-cd4521e63519.png)\r\n\r\nAnd lighter color:\r\n![color2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3320020/28897492-d678f75e-7795-11e7-9fbc-a235d11269a0.png)\r\n\r\nThis screenshots has been made after fresh stable atom install (and removing .atom directory).
