From this I conclude that Atom wants to save keymap.cson, instead of the untitled file.\n\nHowever, even after closing the tab containing the keymap, \"SaveAs\" gives a similar error message (same meaning, though different wording) and insists in using \"keymap\" as a filename for my untitled document, but now a workaround is possible: I click on OK and change the file name from \"keymap\" to

This document is currently aspirational, and describes the hypothetical design of an API that is yet to be implemented.\n\n/cc @as-cii @maxbrunsfeld\n## Overview\n\nDecoration layers provide an alternative API to marker-based decorations for situations in which creating markers is too expensive. Two examples are spell check and find and replace. With decoration layers, instead of creating a marker for every single decoration in the buffer, package authors can perform work incrementally to describe only the decorations for the currently-visible portion of the buffer.\n### Creating a decoration layer\n\nDecoration layers are created by calling the `addDecorationLayer` method with a single function.\n\n``` js\nlet layer = textEditor.addDecorationLayer(function (visibleBufferRange) {\n  return [ /* ... decoration descriptors ... */ ]\n})\n```\n### Returning decorations\n\nWhen necessary, the editor will call this function with a `Range` object representing the currently visible portion of the screen, in buffer coordinates. A full range is used rather than row numbers because due to soft wrapping, only a portion of a line in the buffer might be visible. Buffer coordinates are used rather than screen coordinates because they map more directly to most kinds of analyses required for decorations, such as scanning for search matches or highlighting misspellings.\n\nTo ensure a smooth visual experience, the decoration layer function is synchronous. We may want to discuss allowing decoration layers to return promises, but this would lead to decorations flickering into view and is unacceptable for our initial use cases.\n\nThe return value of a decoration layer's function should be an array of decoration descriptor objects. Each descriptor can contain any of the parameters passed to `decorateMarker` to create marker-based decorations, such as `type`, `class`, etc. In addition, each descriptor object must contain a `bufferRange` key, describing the range to which the decoration applies. Returned ranges should all overlap with the `visibleBufferRange` passed to the function.\n### Decoration layer methods\n\nThe `DecorationLayer` object returned by the call to `addDecorationLayer` has two methods, `update` and `destroy`.\n\nDecoration layer functions will be called automatically when the contents of their editor changes. When decorations change for other reasons, you'll need to manually inform the editor that your layer needs to be re-rendered by calling `update`. This method is asynchronous, meaning a call to update only schedules a view update for the next animation frame. We can potentially return a promise that resolves when the update is completed if it's needed.\n\nTo remove the decoration layer, call `destroy` on it.\n## Implementation\n### Interpolation\n\nDecoration layers need to be fast enough not to impose undue overhead when the visible range changes on the editor. However, performing a full-screen search on every keystroke is untenable. The solution to this problem is interpolation.\n\nWhen the buffer changes, should debounce calls into user-defined decoration functions so as to only perform them at the end of a sequence of changes. In the meantime, we'll want to keep decorations in the correct logical location during edits by maintaining a local marker index. When changes occur to the buffer, we'll apply them to the layer's marker index synchronously, but we won't re-query the user-defined function for each change.\n\nI'd like to use this as a chance to test drive our new [1-d marker index](https://github.com/atom/marker-index) library. Changes will need to be converted to absolute coordinates in order to use it, but it's the cleanest and fastest implementation and I'd like to migrate to using it in `TextBuffer` if it works out in this use case. We shouldn't store decorations as markers on the `TextBuffer`, because there's a ton of overhead associated with creating mutable markers that's unnecessary in this case. Interacting at a low level directly with an index will have much lower overhead.\n\nTo avoid the need to row-and-column-based points to absolute character offsets repeatedly, we may want to change the buffer APIs to include offset information. We'll need to calculate this information in the buffer anyway to accomodate use of the new marker index.\n\nAnother tool that might be useful to aggregate changes is a [patch data structure](https://github.com/nathansobo/atom-patch). This allows a sequence of potentially-overlapping splice operations to be recorded into the patch, and then be played back in a coalesced form asynchronously. Including the offset information and just writing synchronously into the marker index is probably easier, but it's worth keeping in mind that an efficient change-tracking data structure exists.\n### Updates to the view/model relationship\n\nCurrently, we return visible decorations from the model to the view in an object that's indexed by marker id. I think we should add a new, private method to the model that's intended to be consumed by the view. It should return an array of decoration descriptors, each containing a range, so that the view layer no longer needs to interact with markers. This will make it possible to unify our handling of marker- and layer-based decorations in the view in a single code path. The model will be in charge of querying the marker store and decoration layers and combining everything into a single array of data to be consumed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9137/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9136","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9136/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9136/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9136/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9136","id":111305067,"number":9136,"title":"Ubuntu keymap when non-EN keyboard layout active is wrong","user":{"login":"Freezerburn","id":1703084,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1703084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freezerburn","html_url":"https://github.com/Freezerburn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freezerburn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freezerburn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freezerburn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freezerburn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freezerburn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freezerburn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freezerburn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freezerburn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freezerburn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-10-14T01:44:37Z","updated_at":"2015-10-14T01:52:39Z","closed_at":"2015-10-14T01:52:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When running Atom under Ubuntu (14.04 LTS, I believe) with vim-mode and ex-mode installed and using a JP keyboard layout (see:https://www-01.ibm.com/software/globalization/topics/keyboards/images/fig3_new.GIF) the keys are not mapped correctly. Specifically, in the circumstance that was causing me issue, when I press the : key to bring up ex-mode (which is where ' is for QWERTY layout) nothing happened.

I have not tested on Windows.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9135","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9135/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9135/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9135/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9135","id":111299020,"number":9135,"title":"Update Node versions in the docs","user":{"login":"50Wliu","id":2766036,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2766036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu","html_url":"https://github.com/50Wliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722948,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-review","name":"needs-review","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-10-14T00:33:17Z","updated_at":"2015-10-14T21:51:30Z","closed_at":"2015-10-14T21:51:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/9135","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9135","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9135.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9135.patch"},"body":"Instead of specifying both node.js and io.js, just say \"node.js 0.10.x or above\" now that node.js and io.js have merged.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9135/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9134","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9134/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9134/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9134/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9134","id":111271256,"number":9134,"title":"Files keeps marked as modified","user":{"login":"n9iels","id":2659866,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2659866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n9iels","html_url":"https://github.com/n9iels","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n9iels/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n9iels/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n9iels/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n9iels/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n9iels/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n9iels/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n9iels/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n9iels/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n9iels/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-10-13T21:07:07Z","updated_at":"2015-10-13T23:54:50Z","closed_at":"2015-10-13T23:54:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have the following problem wit the Git integration:\n1) I open a folder with a .git folder in it, right click->open with atom\n2) I modified just one line\n3) Atom thinks the whole file is modified.
