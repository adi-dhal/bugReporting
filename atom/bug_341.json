think the [documented Atom API](https://atom.io/docs/api/v0.179.0/Atom) classes should be exported through require('atom'). At least for all classes where it would make sense for a package developer to instantiate. e.g. Workspace shouldn't be exported since no one needs to instantiate that, but Disposable, and CompositeDisposable should be exported since it makes sense for a package developer to instantiate them.\n\nThat's pretty much how things already work... Except for `File` and `Directory` which are documented, but not exported. This causes two problems.\n1. First reading through the API, I see those classes and want to use them, but when I try `{File} = require 'atom'` it doesn't work. Which is very confusing since it does work for the rest of the API.\n2. The workaround is to including the underlying `pathwatcher` package into my own package. That's fine, but makes my package bigger, slower to load, and now I've got an extra dependency to manage. It seems unnecessary since `File` and `Directory` are already a documented part of Atom.\n\nHere's a pull request that exports those classes #5499 \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5543/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5542","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5542/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5542/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5542/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5542","id":57579355,"number":5542,"title":"File Scroll while typing (Bug or Feature ?)","user":{"login":"mostafahussein","id":4104127,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4104127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostafahussein","html_url":"https://github.com/mostafahussein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostafahussein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostafahussein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostafahussein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostafahussein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostafahussein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostafahussein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostafahussein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostafahussein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostafahussein/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":163641905,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/atom","name":"atom","color":"f7c6c7","default":false},{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2015-02-13T09:54:25Z","updated_at":"2015-02-17T22:21:08Z","closed_at":"2015-02-17T22:21:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"after updating atom to the current version 0.179 , when write a large text, it will be hidden behind the status bar, but i found an option called scroll past end in core settings, after activating it it solved the problem, is this a new feature ?
