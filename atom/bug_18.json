Now every time I open Atom, I'm notified of an available update for that package, which I don't want to update. I do, however, want to update other packages but can't utilize the \"Update All\" button to update them all at once.

In that pull-request we managed to prevent IME previews from being displayed in the editor when the originating `keydown` event was default-prevented. However, it was still possible for IME input to make it through the previous workarounds, thus triggering the `textInput` event and showing unwanted text.\r\n\r\nPressing another key that would complete the in-progress IME input would, in fact, first replace `this.lastKeydown` and then trigger the `textInput` event. In the handling of that event we would detect `this.lastKeydown` as \"non-default-prevented\" and therefore mistakenly insert the IME text.\r\n\r\nWith this pull-request we are adopting a different strategy to mitigate the issue. When receiving the wrong `compositionupdate` event we will first disable the hidden input and then re-enable it on the next tick. Disabling the input causes the in-progress IME input to be aborted and the browser to never fire `textInput` nor `compositionupdate` events anymore after that.\r\n\r\nThe only downside of this approach is that the hidden input also loses focus, but we transfer it back to it as soon as the next tick of the event loop is served and the input has been re-enabled.\r\n\r\n@ungb @Ben3eeE: can you give this a spin and see if it fixes the problem?

If they change, each line's height could change too, causing the current scroll top position to not match the viewport the user was observing. Thus, when detecting a line height change, we try to show users the area of the screen they were looking prior to tweaking the font size.\r\n\r\nIn trying to maintain the aforementioned logical position, however, we were mistakenly scheduling a new update before actually finishing the current one. This was problematic because if the first update detected that the longest screen line changed and such line was off-screen, it would try to render it. Before having the chance to measure it, though, the new update would kick in and delete the new longest screen line node, because it assumed it had already been measured. Finally, when\r\n`measureContentDuringUpdateSync` fired, it would notice that the longest screen line node did not exist and throw an exception as a result.\r\n\r\nThis pull-request changes the `updateSync` method to set the `updateScheduled` flag only before returning control to the caller, as opposed to doing so at the beginning. This prevents calls to `scheduleUpdate` made in `updateSync` from scheduling new unwanted updates.\r\n\r\n@Ben3eeE @ungb: can you confirm this fixes the aforementioned issue?

Right now, it's not a good experience to configure indentations in Atom, which is kind of a bother when the rest of Atom is so sleek yet something as important as indentation changes are a bit of a hassle to change.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Ctrl + Shift + P to bring up the Command Palette and look up \"Indent\" doesn't produce any results that lead to changing indentation settings. They're all commands to insert indentation which I doubt is used often.\r\n2. So now we dig into File > Settings > Editor. Scrolling down and down and down, we then find the option to change Tab Length. I assume this changes how tabs are inserted from the time of changing this setting? It's also unclear how to not use spaces to represent tabs and instead use tab characters, which it turns out is the \"Soft Tab\" checkbox which is not necessarily a familiar term.\r\n3. \"Whitespace: Convert Tabs to Spaces\" doesn't seem to work as intended. I have an open file with tab characters as tabs, I hit Ctrl + Shift + P and select \"Whitespace: Convert Tabs to Spaces.\" The tabs remain tabs. I'm not sure of the difference, so I try the separate option of \"Whitespace: Convert All Tabs to Spaces.\" Still nothing.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\n1. Opening the Command Palette and searching \"Indent\" should lead to the settings for changing indentation.\r\n2. It should be much clearer what your tab settings are and how to change them. I suggest at least putting \"Tab Length\" and \"Soft Tabs\" in the same line, because it seems if you have \"hard tabs\" selected and \"tab length\" set, the tab length doesn't actually matter. Also why is there both a check box for Soft Tabs and a dropdown to select Tab Type? It's unclear which one is preferred. It should be clearer at a glance what my current tab behavior is and which settings will change it.\r\n3. The commands for \"Whitespace\" to convert various indentations should work. Also it's unclear if it's changing all whitespace for the current file or active project. It would be nice to have to option to choose the scope of indentation changes.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** n/a\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** n/a\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom v.1.19.0\r\nWindows 7\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThis is mostly a small user experience issue, but Atom is so sleek and smooth to use that I'd love to see it be more user-friendly. I understand that Atom is highly configurable/programmable, but it seems at odds that it requires a LOT of digging/Googling to figure out what configurations do and how to change them when it seems to be aiming to be intuitive and UX-focused.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15301/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15300","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15300/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15300/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15300/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15300","id":250073054,"number":15300,"title":"three '-' won't work to make a separation line","user":{"login":"Superkeyv","id":30654870,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/30654870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superkeyv","html_url":"https://github.com/Superkeyv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superkeyv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superkeyv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superkeyv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superkeyv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superkeyv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superkeyv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superkeyv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superkeyv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superkeyv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-08-14T15:49:49Z","updated_at":"2017-08-14T20:11:01Z","closed_at":"2017-08-14T20:10:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm using \r\natom 1.18.0 x64 at Arch linux\r\nmarkdown-preview-plus 2.4.10\r\n\r\nI found that when I make a separation line\r\n'>---'           without any  'space' , it doesn't work\r\nbut ,if I insert a 'space' between two charactor. it works\r\nfor example\r\n'> ---'\r\n'>- --'\r\n'>-- -'\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it a bug, if so, I hope you can fix it in your next version ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15299","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15299/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15299/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15299/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15299","id":250035933,"number":15299,"title":"Ignore clicks on block decorations","user":{"login":"as-cii","id":482957,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/482957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii","html_url":"https://github.com/as-cii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-08-14T13:47:43Z","updated_at":"2017-08-14T22:07:02Z","closed_at":"2017-08-14T14:59:28Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/15299","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15299","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15299.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15299.patch"},"body":"Fixes #15282.\r\n\r\nPreviously, clicking on a block decoration to interact with it would cause the editor to scroll to the line next to it.
