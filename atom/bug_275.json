Nodejs installation instructions are not included at the Wiki site linked for Mageia or any Mandriva-based distribution, so I decided to install it from source. I made it up to the final stage of Atom installation and through Nodejs installation without error. Namely I made it to `sudo script/grunt install` without issue, the problem is that at the `sudo script/grunt install` stage I received errors stating that `/usr/bin/env` was a bad interpreter. So I deleted it using `sudo rm /usr/bin/env` and created a virtual link between nodejs and env in /usr/bin, namely by running `sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/env` but it made no difference. How do I rectify this problem? \n\nThanks for your

example when using the [Atom project manager](https://github.com/danielbrodin/atom-project-manager), it's very inconvenient that when you've closed all your windows and want to open a new project, you have to open a new Atom window first before the command to open a new project can be used.\n\nSeeing how this command is more of a \"global\" command, and shouldn't really need a window, is it possible for Atom to somehow accept such commands without window (but with the app itself having focus) and just open a new window as needed?\n\nThe work around now is to either remember not to close your last project window, open a new project, and then switch back to close the last one, or close all of them, open a new window, and then open a new project. Since opening a new window takes quite a bit of time to load, it's a bit of a hassle whichever way you do it, and it would be much more optimal if you could just open an existing project, and for that command to open the new window for you.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7531","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7531/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7531/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7531/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7531","id":91717744,"number":7531,"title":"Malformed

editing some files which include Myanmar text. This includes diacritic characters (meaning char + char adding a diacritic (above / below / left / right) the previous char). Atom appears to give each char equal space, meaning that I need to click right of the text to select it, and the highlight appears offset right, too. Each string makes it more difficult to highlight text appearing after it on the line.\n\n![screen shot 2015-06-29 at 3 16 43 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/643918/8402027/e85fe6c8-1e71-11e5-92db-2fa52ebd3203.png)\n\nPut the text နေပြည်တော် in the middle of a long line to see what this looks like.
