on #14435, (commit: https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/14435/commits/a5f4472f5d422d6185c6952ae2c3a6cef68eec1d) which is last commit before merged to master.\r\n\r\n- [Download

   : 7.4.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nI can reproduce with **safe-mode**\r\n\r\n1. open editor, insert three lines of text whatever (`row0\\nrow1\\nrow3`)\r\n2. open chrome dev-tools and paste following js code.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n(function reproduceIssue() {\r\n  const editor = atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor()\r\n  const cursorRow = editor.getCursorBufferPosition().row\r\n  const item = document.createElement(\"span\")\r\n  item.innerText = \"[block decoration]\"\r\n  const marker = editor.markBufferPosition([cursorRow, 0])\r\n  editor.decorateMarker(marker, { type: \"block\", item: item })\r\n})()\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. See **line-gutter**, insert text to row0, row1, row2 and see cursor is shown in incorrect screen position.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\n\r\ncan edit normal way\r\nblock decoration occupy one screen row as like in previous release.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\n\r\nrendering become odd.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\n\r\nalways\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nYou can get this information from copy and pasting the output of `atom --version` and `apm --version` from the command line.

This PR adds it as a configurable setting.\r\nPrimary changes that had to be made:\r\nsrc/text-editor.coffee: Added verticalScrollMargin to constructor/copy/update.\r\nsrc/config-schema.js: Added verticalScrollMargin as an editor property with default of 2 and a description of the feature.\r\nsrc/text-editor-registry.js: Added verticalScrollMargin editor param.\r\nspec/text-editor-spec.coffee: Added tests for the feature.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nThere is a workaround mentioned in issue [#11799](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11799), but this PR simply adds it as a configurable setting.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nIt's an existing feature in core, but its value is hard coded. In other editors this is usually either a configurable feature or non-existent (i.e. 0 margin).\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nPeople who are used to the lack of a vertical scroll margin in other editors, or who wish to customize it, can now easily modify the vertical scroll margin size in the settings.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nNone that I'm aware of.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\n[#11799](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11799)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14738/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14737","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14737/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14737/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14737/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14737","id":234411474,"number":14737,"title":"Ctrl-alt-'letter' Keybindings do not appear as a shortcut","user":{"login":"Interagierende-Systeme","id":27342440,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/27342440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Interagierende-Systeme","html_url":"https://github.com/Interagierende-Systeme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Interagierende-Systeme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Interagierende-Systeme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Interagierende-Systeme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Interagierende-Systeme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Interagierende-Systeme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Interagierende-Systeme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Interagierende-Systeme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Interagierende-Systeme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Interagierende-Systeme/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":505038679,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-06-08T04:55:31Z","updated_at":"2017-06-09T02:44:09Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n![menu_bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27342440/26912866-71f377fe-4c17-11e7-83e4-00276419b9dc.png)\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [X] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCtrl-alt-'Letter' keybindings do not appear as shortcuts in menu items.\r\nAll other key bindings appear as shortcuts except ctrl-alt.

Open terminal and run the python script you downloaded to generate a 74mb file\r\n`python fileMaker.py`\r\n3. You should have a file called `70mbFileTest.cpp`, run `atom 70mbFileTest.cpp` to open this file on atom.\r\n4. scroll to the last line of this file (cmd+down arrow) on mac. \r\n5. Completely exit out of atom.\r\n6. Open atom(should restore previous state)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\ntext editor lines should be aligned correctly  \r\n\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\nMisaligned tiles on the editor\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** If you close and open the file again it shows up correctly.
