This branch is a working proposal that does that (there's a corresponding tree-view branch).\n\nI'm thinking that it should follow the pattern we've put forth with keybindings, use a css selector to specify the relevant elements and then list the label and it's corresponding command to trigger. I'd be open to adding this as a dedicated file in the atom package format like keymaps but I feel like it might be nicer to register another export function in packages (something like `registerContextMenus`). Or maybe packages should call onto globals like is done currently.

So I spent some time investigating what was happening.\n\nI ended up using mirror/chromium as my test repository. It has roughly ~51,000 files whereas github/github has ~13,000 files. So when I benchmarked `nak`, `ag`, and `ack` I found that `nak` fell solidly between the two of them. `nak` took about ~25s, `ag` took ~15s and `ack` ~40s.\n\nI also investigated the overhead of shelling out to another process (as that's how we use `nak` to avoid issues with node's eventloop within Chrome). It turned out that this was minimal and definitely worth it to avoid blocking the UI.\n\nWhen running `nak` against github/github within atom we found that the first result would be returned within ~1.7s and the last around ~5s. After taking a closer look at `nak`'s algorithm it's difficult to reduce the time of the first result as it depends on searching all results for sorting before returning. If we didn't sort it could cause the UI to stutter as things may be inserted at the top of the list (which is undesirable).\n\nAfter further investigation, @probablycorey and I found that the `core.excludeVcsIgnoredPaths` option had a significant impact on github/github searching (without it searching would take ~10s) but it's disabled by default. \n\nSo long story short I'm purposing that we default `core.excludeVcsIgnoredPaths` to true as I believe users would expect it and everyone would enjoy the faster searching.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/808/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/807","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/807/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/807/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/807/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/807","id":19278260,"number":807,"title":"Publish
