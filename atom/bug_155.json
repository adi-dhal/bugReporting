[atom cli discards its input from stdin](https://discuss.atom.io/t/it-would-be-nice-to-be-able-to-pipe-standard-out-to-atom-and-have-it-open-in-an-unsaved-document/4781) when other editors would open a new document containing that text.\n\nThis change writes input from stdin to a new temporary file and inserts that file as the first argument to the atom executable.\nIt only does that when stdin is not at tty, i.e. running `git diff | atom` creates and opens a temporary file but running `atom some/file` does not.\n\nCloses https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/1729\n## Caveats\n- [ ] Errors from `mktemp` are not handled.\n- [ ] The call to `mktemp` appears before ensuring that `TMPDIR` is set on line 105.\n- [ ] `mktemp` is called without arguments, resulting in a filename like `tmp.XXXXXXXX`.  \n  A filename prefix like `atom-stdin` would be nicer but the mktemp commands on [Linux](http://www.unix.com/man-page/linux/1/mktemp/) and [OS X](http://www.unix.com/man-page/osx/1/mktemp/) are sufficiently different to make this more involved. (A call like `mktemp -t atom-stdin` would work on OS X but wouldn't include a random suffix on Linux, if I understand the man page correctly.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11184/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11183","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11183/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11183/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11183/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11183","id":141576367,"number":11183,"title":"Fuzzy search items disappear after one second","user":{"login":"catamphetamine","id":477167,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/477167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/catamphetamine","html_url":"https://github.com/catamphetamine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catamphetamine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catamphetamine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catamphetamine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catamphetamine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catamphetamine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catamphetamine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catamphetamine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catamphetamine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catamphetamine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-03-17T12:58:48Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T19:10:05Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T19:10:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When I open \"fuzzy search\" (Cmd + P) there's a list of recently used files.\nI hit no keys and then, after a second, the list of recently used files changes with the recently used files out of the list this time.\nIs this a bug?\nI'm using the latest Atom on OS X.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11183/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11182","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11182/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11182/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11182/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11182","id":141574779,"number":11182,"title":"Uncaught Error: spawn /Users/magnus/Library/Application Support/com.github.atom.ShipIt/update.VFp...","user":{"login":"kombridge","id":510589,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/510589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kombridge","html_url":"https://github.com/kombridge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kombridge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kombridge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kombridge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kombridge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kombridge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kombridge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kombridge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kombridge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kombridge/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-03-17T12:52:44Z","updated_at":"2016-03-17T12:56:46Z","closed_at":"2016-03-17T12:56:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[Enter steps to reproduce below:]\n1.

Atom (JavaScript syntax)\nfunction () {...\n\n/*\n * What I expect to happen to happen in a given syntax\n */\n// Folding the function - Atom (Plain Text syntax)\nfunction () {\n}\n\n// Folding the function - Sublime Text\nfunction () {\n}\n\n// A one-line variation\nfunction () {..}\n```\n\nAnd another example using HTML\n\n``` html\n<!-- Example code -->\n<section>\n  <p>Hello world.</p>\n</section>\n\n<!--\n How Atom currently handles folds within a given syntax\n -->\n<!-- Folding the block - Atom (HTML syntax) -->\n<section>...\n\n<!--\n What I expect to happen to happen in a given syntax\n -->\n<!-- Folding the block - Atom (Plain Text syntax) -->\n<section>\n</section>\n\n<!-- Folding the block - Sublime Text -->\n<section>\n</section>\n\n<!-- A one-line variation -->\n<section>...</section>\n```\n\nThe `Atom (Plain Text syntax)` and `Sublime Text` format is easier to parse because it's clear where the function/block starts and stops. It also makes wrapping a folded block with more code easier because you can see the beginning and end of the full statement.\n\nThe other problem with the current Atom folding method is indenting a folded function does not work properly.\n\n**JavaScript Example**:\n![Indenting folded JavaScript in Atom](https://zippy.gfycat.com/ExcellentMerryCoyote.gif)\n\n**HTML Example**:\n![Indenting folded HTML in Atom](https://zippy.gfycat.com/FarTenseAdeliepenguin.gif)\n\n@lee-dohm suggested I provide some examples of other folds besides just the [1TBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Variant:_1TBS) style. I've noted some proposals:\n\n**Stroustrup**:\n\n``` c++\n// Example\nclass Vector { \n  public:\n      Vector(int s) :elem(new double[s]), sz(s) { }\n      double& operator[](int i) { return elem[i]; }\n      int size() { return sz; } \n  private:\n      double elem[lowast];\n      int sz;\n};\n\n// Expected\nclass Vector {\n  public:...\n  private:...\n}\n```\n\n**Allman**:\n\n``` js\n// Example\nwhile (x == y)\n{\n  something();\n  somethingelse();\n}\n\n// Expected\nwhile (x == y)\n{\n}\n```\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Launch Atom\n2. In the correct syntax (not just \"Plain Text\"), write a multiline, indented function/block\n3. Collapse block\n4. (To replicate indentation issue) Indent the folded, one-line block\n### Versions\n\n**Atom**: 1.5.4\n**apm**: 1.6.0\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11179/reactions","total_count":27,"+1":27,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11178","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11178/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11178/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11178/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11178","id":141240819,"number":11178,"title":"Uncaught

It breaks the `fuzzy-finder` as well as any other packages that uses core classes from that module (like the `Emitter` or the `Disposable` classes).\n\nFor instance, when running in safe mode, the `fuzzy-finder` package is failing with: \n\n```\nCannot find module 'atom' Error: Cannot find module 'atom'\n    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:338:15)\n    at Function.Module._load

in #10927, but with `cmd-backtick` as keybinding, using a French keyboard layout (AZERTY). \nThe command no longer cycles through the open Atom windows. \nI'm using a modified french layout to remove the backtick dead-key, but I have the same behaviour when using the original layout.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open several Atom windows\n2.
