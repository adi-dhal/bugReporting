This PR corrects that. You can now add context menus with the same format as adding application menus, with selectors mapping to arrays containing menu items as follows:\n\n``` coffee\natom.contextMenu.add '.editor': [\n  {label: 'Undo', command: 'core:undo'}\n  {label: 'Redo', command: 'core:redo'}\n  {label: 'Other', submenu: [\n    {label: 'Transpose', command: 'editor:transpose'}\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```\n## Created and Should Display Hooks\n\nThere's also a new `shouldDisplay` hook to address a use case I saw in color-picker, which is currently digging into `ContextMenuManager` internals to conditionally display a menu item. This is a sketch of how the API could be used, but not real code from the actual color-picker.\n\n``` coffee\natom.contextMenu.add '.editor': [{\n  label: 'Pick Color',\n  command: 'color-picker:',\n  shouldDisplay: (event) -> # use the right click event to decide...\n}]\n```\n\nThe `executeAtBuild` hook has been replaced with `created`. I couldn't find anyone using this other than us because it wasn't exposed in our API, so I went ahead and just renamed it without shimming. Here's the `created` hook being used to add the `x` and `y` of the click event to the command.\n\n``` coffee\natom.contextMenu.add '.workspace': [{\n  label: 'Inspect Element'\n  command: 'application:inspect'\n  devMode: true\n  created: (event) ->\n    {pageX, pageY} = event\n    @commandOptions = {x: pageX, y: pageY}\n}]\n```\n## Dev Mode\n\nDev-mode-only items were formerly expressed with a trailing options hash on the entire call to `::add`. Now each individual item can contain a `devMode` field indicating whether it should only display in dev mode. You can see this in the `Inspect Element` example above.\n## Disposables\n\nFinally, `::add` now returns a disposable on which `::dispose` can be called to remove the added item descriptors.\n## Outreach\n\nWe should probably talk to the author of color-picker and any other packages that dig into context menu internals to get them to switch to the new API. We may even want to send them a PR before merging this if the number is manageable.\n\n/cc @atom/core \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3658/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3657","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3657/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3657/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3657/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3657","id":44337701,"number":3657,"title":"Hex string display problem","user":{"login":"F0x06","id":7167311,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7167311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/F0x06","html_url":"https://github.com/F0x06","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/F0x06/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/F0x06/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/F0x06/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/F0x06/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/F0x06/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/F0x06/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/F0x06/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/F0x06/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/F0x06/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-09-29T18:49:27Z","updated_at":"2014-09-29T19:28:36Z","closed_at":"2014-09-29T19:25:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\nI have a strange issue, for example, if i wrote the following   Python script:\n\n``` python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\nTEST = \"\\xFF\\xFF\\xFF\\xFF\"\n```\n\nAtom render the code like this (I tried to select the line in the image):\n\n![20140929184103255](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7167311/4447191/dfb77864-4808-11e4-94ef-e268934bc05b.jpeg)\n\nNo problem with other variables, only with \\X..\n\nAtom version: latest (Compiled today)\n\nCheers, F0x\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3657/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3656","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3656/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3656/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3656/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3656","id":44323442,"number":3656,"title":"Folder colors don't update to reflect git changes","user":{"login":"gmmeyer","id":3253673,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3253673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmmeyer","html_url":"https://github.com/gmmeyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmmeyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmmeyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmmeyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmmeyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmmeyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmmeyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmmeyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmmeyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmmeyer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2014-09-29T17:41:00Z","updated_at":"2015-06-29T18:13:09Z","closed_at":"2015-06-29T18:13:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"If I save a file, the file (in the sidebar) will change colors to tell me that it has changed, but only if the folder tree is open to that file.

System Information\n\nXubuntu 14.04\nAtom 0.132.0\n### Reproduction Steps\n1. Paste the following text into an empty file:\n   \n   ```\n   asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd\n   asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd\n   asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd\n   asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd\n   asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd\n   asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd asd\n   ```\n2. Place the cursor on the first word\n3. Press and hold _Ctrl + D_ until all words are selected with their own cursor.\n4. Press escape to clear the multiple cursors\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAll cursors are cleared except one\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe editor freezes and I have to kill it\n### Notes\n- The editor only freezes when a fair amount of cursors exist. A handful of selections doesn't seem to cause an issue. I thought about giving an exact number, but it may vary depending on hardware.\n- Another way to clear multiple cursors is to click anywhere on the text area. This works fine.\n- The top menu bar still seems to work, making me think the freeze is localized to the text area.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3647","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3647/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3647/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3647/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3647","id":44189405,"number":3647,"title":"Black

info from a website into a file and saved it.\n\nIt was when hitting 'control s' that I noticed a new file appear (page.php):\n\n![atom-files](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/775993/4430240/52a763d8-4625-11e4-9b1a-d94cf6d6feea.png)\n\nThis file was from the previous Wordpress project and it was now in the new project.\nI can't recall if I had been editing that file or if it was open when I closed the previous project.\n\nI have since upgraded to version 0.132.0 (The request to upgrade was in the
