These errors did not appear in versions prior to 1.13.0, and while they may be correct, should at the very least be displayed in a more \"pleasing\" manner.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Enter a quote or some otherwise malformed CSS into the Font Family box.  Some reports also suggest that a semicolon can cause the error, but I couldn't reproduce it.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Nothing\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** CssSyntaxError\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100% for quotes or otherwise invalid CSS, 0% for semicolons\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nYou can get this information from copy and pasting the output of `atom --version` and `apm --version` from the command line. Also, please include the OS and what version of the OS you're running.\r\n\r\nNot relevant, this is a 1.13 regression.

e.g. missing semi colon, incorrect indentation, etc.\r\n\r\nFor a while now, when this happens, Atom tends to momentarily blank out the window and then re-insert the fixed contents, causing the window to scroll up. This is problematic, as it causes you to lose your scroll position and as such your focus of the area of code you were working on.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Install/enable only core packages and linter as well as linter-eslint\r\n2. Use the following rules for eslint:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"parser\": \"babel-eslint\",\r\n    \"env\": {\r\n        \"es6\": true\r\n    },\r\n    \"rules\": {\r\n        \"semi\": [ 1, \"always\" ]\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Open these file contents (thanks @dwelle) http://pastebin.com/raw/Yk6K1w5k and save as `test.js`.\r\n4. Scroll to the bottom and remove the last semi colon.\r\n5. Save the file\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nContents remains visible, then is fixed/replaced by a fixed contents, while maintaining scroll position.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\nThe buffer is cleared, then contents re-appears and the scroll position is at the top.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:**\r\nNearly 100% with the provided example file.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nOS X: 10.11.5\r\nAtom    : 1.14.0-dev-157e8e1\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\napm  1.15.1\r\nnpm  3.10.5\r\nnode 4.4.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.10\r\ngit 2.6.2\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\nNote that while the example file is quite large with 3000+ lines, this behaviour *does* occur quite regularly with smaller files as well. It's just not 100% reproducible in those cases. But it could be that the file size/length emphasises the issue.\r\n\r\n### See also\r\n- https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-eslint/issues/620\r\n- https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-eslint/issues/774\r\n- https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11483","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13656/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13655","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13655/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13655/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13655/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13655","id":201658718,"number":13655,"title":"The Enter key doesn't work when I try to create whether file or folder","user":{"login":"AbirkulovSherali","id":13017856,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/13017856?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbirkulovSherali","html_url":"https://github.com/AbirkulovSherali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbirkulovSherali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbirkulovSherali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbirkulovSherali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbirkulovSherali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbirkulovSherali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbirkulovSherali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbirkulovSherali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbirkulovSherali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbirkulovSherali/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-01-18T18:44:35Z","updated_at":"2017-01-19T00:11:54Z","closed_at":"2017-01-19T00:11:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I use the latest version of Atom Code Editor.

Introduces an `isConnected` flag to `state-store`.\r\n\r\nIn the common (for me) case where you open e.g. beta after you've opened stable, and beta fails to connect to the indexedDB, it's set false.\r\n\r\n2.
