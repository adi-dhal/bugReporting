have [asked](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27729734/styling-alternating-lines-in-atom-editor) this on Stack overflow but it seems to be harder than I thought.\n\nProblem: I wanted to make the odd lines a different colour so that when I set soft line wraps I can see clearly that it is one line split over 2 or 3 without having to focus on the dots in the gutter.\n\nAttempt to fix: In my style.less I tried adding:\n\n.editor .line:nth-child(2n){\n  background-color:#292929;\n}\n\nThen I tried:\n.editor .line[data-screen-row]:nth-child(2n) {\n  background-color:#292929;\n}\n\nHere is the screen shot in the SO post:\n![atom_line_mess](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/775993/5596890/e0cb89a2-92db-11e4-9aae-20ab755224c8.png)\n\nThe issue: The order of the lines is not related to the actual order in the document so this was not consistent. I don't know why the data-screen-row didn't work but it still did not highlight correctly.\n\nI am currently looking into plugins but I can not figure out how to effect these line generators (if someone can tell me where to look I can work on a plugin.\n\nI think it would need something like for example an odd and even class on the lines (It would also need to know if the line is wrapped and make it even or odd based on the original document and not the display in the DOM.\n\nIs there a way to do this with just CSS/LESS that I missed?\n\nAnother issue I noticed is that when I add the background colour to the lines highlighting does not work, It would also be nice to add a way to control the depth so advice about how that would work would also be cool.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice you can offer.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4828","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4828/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4828/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4828/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4828","id":53255874,"number":4828,"title":"Uncaught Error: spawn jekyll ENOENT","user":{"login":"imageaid","id":12118,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/12118?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imageaid","html_url":"https://github.com/imageaid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imageaid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imageaid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imageaid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imageaid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imageaid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imageaid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imageaid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imageaid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imageaid/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-01-02T14:44:31Z","updated_at":"2015-01-06T17:59:28Z","closed_at":"2015-01-06T17:59:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[Enter steps to reproduce below:]\n1.

It's faster than most other apps on OS X, and the inconsistency squicks my CDO. I definitely don't need or want it changed in the base app, but would like the ability to make a package for it. I am aware of [ease-blink](https://atom.io/packages/ease-blink) but I don't see the API it uses in the documentation, and the search isn't finding it. I will freely admit that I am brand new to Atom and thus am probably missing something; pointers to the manual would be greatly appreciated, if that's what I'm missing!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4825/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4824","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4824/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4824/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4824/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4824","id":53231881,"number":4824,"title":"Uncaught Error: spawn /usr/share/atom/atom (deleted) ENOENT","user":{"login":"gopiariv","id":8105641,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8105641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopiariv","html_url":"https://github.com/gopiariv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopiariv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopiariv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopiariv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopiariv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopiariv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopiariv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopiariv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopiariv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopiariv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-01-01T23:41:28Z","updated_at":"2015-01-02T19:56:00Z","closed_at":"2015-01-02T19:56:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[Enter steps to reproduce below:]\n1. ...\n2. ...\n\n**Atom Version**: 0.165.0\n**System**: linux 3.13.0-40-generic\n**Thrown From**: Atom Core\n### Stack Trace\n\nUncaught Error: spawn /usr/share/atom/atom (deleted) ENOENT\n\n```\nAt events.js:85\n\nError: spawn /usr/share/atom/atom (deleted) ENOENT\n  at exports._errnoException (util.js:742:11)\n  at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (child_process.js:1051:32)\n  at child_process.js:1142:20\n  at process._tickCallback (node.js:378:11)\n\n```\n### Commands\n\n```\n```\n### Config\n\n```\n{\n  \"core\": {},\n  \"editor\": {}\n}\n```\n### Installed Packages\n\n``` coffee\n# User\nNo installed packages\n\n# Dev\nNo dev packages\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4824/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4823","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4823/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4823/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4823/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4823","id":53230563,"number":4823,"title":"Atom on ARM architecture","user":{"login":"henrywright","id":1963288,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1963288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrywright","html_url":"https://github.com/henrywright","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrywright/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrywright/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrywright/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrywright/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrywright/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrywright/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrywright/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrywright/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrywright/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-01-01T22:37:29Z","updated_at":"2015-01-06T18:00:07Z","closed_at":"2015-01-06T18:00:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"My laptop runs Ubuntu Linux and uses a Samsung Exynos processor (an ARM chip).
