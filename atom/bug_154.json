Title was edited to reflect that the issue is reported on all platforms, though the following report was originally for Ubuntu 14.04_\n\nSince updating to version 1.6.0 (from 1.5.4, where the problem didn't exist) Atom freezes when trying to open files in networked project folders (i.e. remote folders added to an Atom Project) which are connected via SFTP _(edit: Confirmed to also occur on Samba, SSHFS, etc )._ I have run Atom in safe mode and also tried 1.7 beta and had the same problem.  The networked folders are connected through the built-in \"Connect to Server\" feature in Ubuntu's Nautilus file browser.  Ubuntu 14.04 was the platform tested.\n\nThe **Editor is not responding** message appears after waiting for nearly thirty seconds, and choosing **Keep Waiting** sometimes unfreezes the window, though sometimes not. The problem happens again as soon as another file is selected from the project tree. Atom also commonly freezes when restarting the program with these project folders added, and if it does eventually unfreeze it _will_ soon freeze again when trying to open a project file.\n\nThe problem occurs with linked folders on local virtual servers as well as remote servers, so high WAN latency does not appear to be the issue. Atom does not seem to have any CPU spikes during the freeze either as far as I can tell.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Mount a remote folder via SSH/SFTP in Ubuntu using its Nautilus file browser ('Connect to server' option).\n2. Add the folder to an Atom project using the standard folder browser.\n3. Once folder is added try to view folder structure or open a file in Atom's tree view.\n\n**Expected behavior:** \nExpected behavior is that the remote project folder operates identically to a local project folder.\n\n**Actual behavior:**\nAtom repeatedly freezes for an extended period of time when using the project tree viewer for remote folders and files.\n### Versions\n\nProblem occurs in Atom 1.6.0 and later.  Problem did not exist in Atom 1.5.4.  Platform is Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11214/reactions","total_count":13,"+1":13,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11213","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11213/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11213/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11213/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11213","id":142115165,"number":11213,"title":"Font-family name field in the settings (unnecessary quote mark)","user":{"login":"danilopeixoto5","id":5114605,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5114605?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danilopeixoto5","html_url":"https://github.com/danilopeixoto5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danilopeixoto5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danilopeixoto5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danilopeixoto5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danilopeixoto5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danilopeixoto5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danilopeixoto5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danilopeixoto5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danilopeixoto5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danilopeixoto5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":171329633,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-reproduction","name":"needs-reproduction","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-03-20T00:35:31Z","updated_at":"2016-04-11T17:48:54Z","closed_at":"2016-04-11T17:48:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\n\nProblem to set the font-family in the settings.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.

repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n\nI am not sure if this issue fits here or over at https://github.com/atom/atom-keymap, apologies.\n- [X] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nAtom freezes or crashes when a non-bound key binding shares the same prefix as a bound key binding.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Create an example keybinding in your keymap file; (this is a trivial example; while they make Atom effectively non-functional, these types of bindings are, I expect, not so uncommon for us vim mode folk):\n\n```\n    'atom-text-editor':\n      'space b d': 'tabs:close-tab'\n```\n1. Hitting space, b, d will delete the tab as expected.\n2. Now: instead, hit space b y (or any other unbound key).\n\n**Expected behavior:** Nothing happens.\n\n**Actual behavior:** Atom freezes for an extended time.  Attempting this in safe mode crashes, otherwise it freezes and eventually shows a stack trace referenced in #6102.  However, this does not appear to be the same issue from what is being discussed there.  Development console in addition shows:\n\n```\n    Uncaught exception\n        module.exports.KeymapManager.simulateTextInput @ (program):446\n    Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded\n        /usr/lib/atom/node_modules/atom-keymap/lib/keymap-manager.js:459\n```\n### Versions\n\nAffects 1.6.0 and 1.5.4.  Downgrading to 1.5.3 solves the issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11203/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11202","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11202/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11202/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11202/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11202","id":141926568,"number":11202,"title":"Atom sidebar can only open one file","user":{"login":"ripter","id":121869,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/121869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ripter","html_url":"https://github.com/ripter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ripter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ripter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ripter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ripter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ripter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ripter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ripter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ripter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ripter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-03-18T17:08:06Z","updated_at":"2016-05-22T02:07:21Z","closed_at":"2016-03-18T17:22:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](https://atom.io/docs/latest/hacking-atom-debugging#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](https://atom.io/docs/latest/hacking-atom-debugging#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](https://atom.io/docs/latest/hacking-atom-debugging)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n\nFor more information on how to write a good [bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) or [enhancement request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\nClicking a file on the sidebar will only open a new tab if you have never clicked on a file before.

Despite this, Atom 1.6.0 installed on the same Arch Linux installation is working fine without issue. It does not matter if I start 1.7.0-beta0 from the command-line with `atom-beta` or from its `.desktop` file launcher. I have tried launching it with `atom-beta --safe .` and still it crashed on me. `atom-beta` returns the following output, if it helps:\n\n``` bash\n/usr/bin/atom-beta: line 115: 14844 Segmentation fault      (core dumped) nohup \"$ATOM_PATH\" --executed-from=\"$(pwd)\" --pid=$$ \"$@\" > \"$ATOM_HOME/nohup.out\" 2>&1\nApp load time: 434ms\nFailed to get crash dump id.\nReport Id: \nFailed to get crash dump id.\nReport Id: \n```\n\nHow did I install Atom 1.7.0 beta0?
