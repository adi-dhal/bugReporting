We decided today that we shouldnt have to write special theme specific css for each package. We didnt want to have a package author open pull requests on each theme, or have to support each theme in their package. Most of the things different between themes is colors. \n\nSo we decided to have some set of variables available to the packages. This pull just adds a colors.less file to each theme, and a fallback less file so packages dont panic when there is no ui theme set. \n\nBasically, it allows you to import anything from any currently loaded theme that is made of a directory. So\n\n``` css\n@import \"colors\";\n\n.my-plugin { background: @background-color-1; }\n```\n\nI'm not sure how best to group the colors. Thinking along the lines of this:\n\n``` scss\n// Colors get generally darker as the number increases\n@background-color-1: #333;\n@background-color-2: #202123;\n@background-color-3: #1b1c1e;\n\n// Info colors are generally blue\n@accent-color-info-1: #66a6ff;\n@accent-color-info-2: #0098ff;\n@accent-color-info-3: #5293d8;\n\n// Error colors are generally red\n@accent-color-error-1: #f78a46;\n...\n\n// Success colors are green\n@accent-color-success-1: #46f78a;\n\n...\n```\n\nNot entirely sure what colors we need yet. \n\nSee #701 for the original pull request.\n\nHACK\n- It reloads all the package css each time you add/change a theme. Not fast. Not ideal. \n\nTODO\n- [x] pull all the colors out into the colors.less files, use in respective places when we settle on a naming convention.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/705","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/705/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/705/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/705/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/705","id":18027615,"number":705,"title":"The Brand of Atom","user":{"login":"cameronmcefee","id":72919,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/72919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronmcefee","html_url":"https://github.com/cameronmcefee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronmcefee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronmcefee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronmcefee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronmcefee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronmcefee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronmcefee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronmcefee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronmcefee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronmcefee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2013-08-13T23:37:21Z","updated_at":"2013-12-02T21:41:34Z","closed_at":"2013-08-14T02:07:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It's been brought up that Atom should be branded as \"Atom\".

But of course, a package author could just put this theme specific stuff into their global stylesheet. \n\nAn alternative is selectively loading stylesheets with the same name as the theme from the package's `stylesheet` directory (I remember a section in the docs talking about this with a 'not implemented' tag).

In the Federal government of the United States, requirements can be issued from the White House or the Congress. In NATO, a commander uses requirements (sometimes called 'Essential Elements of Intelligence (EEIs)) to initiate the intelligence cycle.\nCollection[edit source | editbeta]\nIn response to requirements, an intelligence staff develops an intelligence collection plan applying available sources and methods and seeking intelligence from other agencies. Depending on the organization and its access, sources may include HUMINT (human intelligence), IMINT (imagery intelligence), ELINT (electronic intelligence), SIGINT (Signals Intelligence), OSINT (open source, or publicly available intelligence), etc.\nProcessing[edit source | editbeta]\nOnce the collection plan is executed and information arrives, it is processed for exploitation. This involves the translation of raw intelligence materials from a foreign language, evaluation of relevance and reliability, and collation of the raw intelligence in preparation for exploitation.\nAnalysis[edit source | editbeta]\nAnalysis establishes the significance and implications of processed intelligence, integrates it by combining disparate pieces of information to identify collateral information and patterns, then interprets the significance of any newly developed knowledge.\nDissemination[edit source | editbeta]\nFinished intelligence products take many forms depending on the needs of the decision maker and reporting requirements. The level of urgency of various types of intelligence is typically established by an intelligence organization or community. An indications and warning (I&W) bulletin would require higher precedence than an annual report, for example.\nFeedback[edit source | editbeta]\nThe intelligence cycle is a closed loop; feedback is received from the decision maker and revised requirements issued.\n```\n\ninto the editor while soft wrap was enabled (it makes it easier to write prose).

wrapping breaks apart completely and creates a big mess if a certain sequence of actions is performed. I'm on OSX 10.8.4 and Atom 17.0.\n\nTo reproduce:\n1. Start Atom, open a blank new file, and turn on soft wrapping\n2. Enter text until it wraps to the other line:\n   ![screen shot 2013-08-07 at 3 27 54 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/38924/928220/9fc0a024-ffb0-11e2-9a71-ff8e5c034dcc.png)\n3. Your cursor being at the end of line 1, press ENTER to go to the next line. This correctly creates a newline character and moves the cursor to the beginning of the next line:\n   ![screen shot 2013-08-07 at 3 29 19 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/38924/928227/d228929c-ffb0-11e2-9cbf-d1a0742f17d9.png)\n4. Press BACKSPACE. This deletes the new line that was just created and correctly moves the cursor back to the end of line 1. Screenshot same as in step 2:\n   ![screen shot 2013-08-07 at 3 27 54 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/38924/928287/04a372d6-ffb2-11e2-8c08-82801985b4ef.png)\n5.

I've always disliked meta in Emacs and think it's a bigger mistake in Atom due to the social nature.

On top of that, having to mentally translate \"meta\" to \"command\" in Atom in keymaps or text is annoying.\n\nI would much rather we do what github.com and Sublime do.

We built out a toggle-quotes feature and wanted to be able to find the range of a string containing the cursor's current position. I'd like to replace the arrays of simple tokens in `TokenizedBuffer` with a proper concrete syntax tree, with the tokens as its leaves. But for now I just scan left and right on the current line to find the limits of the scope.
