as of Feb 2016 (see discussion below):\nImprove multi-pane API to allow creating empty panes, as well as moving or copying files among them. \nAddresses #4738.\n- [x] Add an option (namely `moveActiveItem`) to `Pane::split`, allowing to move the active item when splitting, instead of copying it\n- [x] Rewrite `pane:split-<direction>` commands to create empty panes\n- [x] Add `pane:split-<direction>-and-<action>-active-item` commands, to achieve original behaviour of the split commands and, alternatively, move the current item instead of copying it\n- [x] Add `window:<action>-active-item-to-pane-<direction'>` to allow moving and copying files between panes\n\nWhere\n- `<direction>` is either `up`, `down`, `right` or `left`\n- `<action>` is either `copy` or `move`\n- `<direction'>` is either `above`, `below`, `on-right` or `on-left`\n\nBehavior for current key bindings is kept. For example, <kbd>cmd-k left</kbd> (<kbd>ctrl-k left</kbd>) will now trigger `pane:split-left-and-copy-active-item` instead of `pane:split-left`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7953/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7952","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7952/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7952/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/7952/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7952","id":95774306,"number":7952,"title":"Don't

Please, note that it’s still a :construction_worker: _work in progress_ :construction_worker: and, as a result, there are still some minor hiccups and a few performance regressions, which I am going to expound later in this description.\n#### Background\n\nHave a look at #6055 to get a sense of why we want to do this. @nathansobo did a great job at explaining the drawbacks of the current approach and how we could possibly solve them, so I strongly recommend to read that issue in depth.\n#### Solution: `<iframe>`\n\nThe idea with the approach proposed in this PR is to have an independent context where we can arbitrarily build a bunch of DOM nodes exclusively for measuring purposes. We employed an `<iframe>` for this, so that a reflow in the measurement context does not affect the main document and viceversa.\n\nTo accomplish this we have introduced `LinesYardstick` (naming is hard :sweat_smile:), an abstraction whose purpose is to hide the complexity of dealing with the measurement context housekeeping. The API is simple:\n- `buildDomNodesForScreenRows`\n- `leftPixelPositionForScreenPosition`\n\nWe need to explicitly have two separate steps, as otherwise we’d end up continously changing the DOM and reading from it, thus causing extra reflows.\n#### The Measurement Context\n\nThe context, as stated previously, is an `<iframe>` that replicates some of the functionalities featured on the fully fledged document, namely:\n- Has a bunch of line nodes\n- Includes a custom `<style>` element which contains font-size information\n- Includes `<atom-styles>` which, in turn, contains the syntax theme\n\nYou can think of it as a skinny replica of the larger document, where line characters occupy the exact same space and are, therefore, measurable. It’s extremely important for this context to be independent, as we will use it in `TextEditorPresenter` as well as in `DisplayBuffer` (in the future).\n#### Performance\n\n**Side note**: this section is a collection of personal thoughts and may not be accurate or necessarily _correct_. However, it will hopefully serve as a starting point for further optimizations and discussions.\n\nWe have encountered several performance regressions along the way, especially for performance sensitive scenarios such as scrolling. Keep in mind that for such _intensive_ activities we need to respect the 16ms budget.\n\nAs of today, the steps we perform are the following:\n1. Right before updating (i.e. at the beginning of `TextEditorPresenter#getState`), we build the DOM nodes for a bunch of screen rows we know we are going to measure:\n   - All the rows that will be rendered on screen after the update (to make sure decorations, cursors, etc. will be able to measure stuff).\n   - The longest row (to calculate the maximum width of the open document).\n   - The last cursor row (to calculate the hidden input position).\n2. As we update things (`@updateDecorations`, `@updateCursors`), we call `@pixelPositionForScreenPosition` which, in turn, will query `LinesYardstick` for positions. The first time this method is called, a `Recalculate Style` and a `Layout` will be triggered.\n\nThese are the two main operations and you can see how they perform on a quite heavy scrolling session (profiler disabled to avoid performance overhead):\n\n![screen shot 2015-07-17 at 11 59 41](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/8744934/5ed3ee00-2c7b-11e5-8e9a-accb2552ba9e.png)\n\nAnd, if we zoom in one of those spikes:\n\n![screen shot 2015-07-17 at 12 01 21](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/8744964/90306546-2c7b-11e5-8a9c-d65e38a71eff.png)\n\nThe first half of the picture is the illustration of the aforementioned steps:\n1. Building HTML: `1.33ms`\n2. Parsing HTML: `1.28ms`\n3. Recalculate Style: `0.839ms`\n4. Layout: `1.408ms`\n\nThe whole frame took `20ms`; measuring the first half via Chrome (Shift+Click) reported `6ms`.\n\nNow the question is: what could we improve? There are a couple of possibilities:\n1. Build the same HTML for the lines in the context as well as for the lines in the real document. This way we can avoid reparsing the lines twice, although cloning the nodes still takes some time. Not sure if this is really useful.\n2. Build skinnier lines for the measurement context. Ideally, we should avoid as much nesting as possible and, reducing the scopes complexity by building only those ones needed for styling, could improve that. It's also true that it would complicate things a bit (involves dealing with CSS rules, etc.). (eb8a1c0)\n3. Be smarter about updates. Instead of including every possible line, we build and layout only those lines needed for position-based updates. The drawback here is that, when e.g. we have decoration for each visible row, this optimization is useless. This means I want to make sure to speedup the current process instead of relying on not having certain rows. Anyway, this improvement has a positive impact on `Layout`, `Recalculate Style` and HTML manipulation. To get a sense of what this could look like, here's a relevant snippet:\n   \n   ``` coffee\n   getMeasurableScreenRows: ->\n     measurableRows = new Set\n   \n     @addOverlaysRowsToSet(measurableRows)\n     @addCursorsRowsToSet(measurableRows)\n     @addDecorationsRowsToSet(measurableRows)\n   \n     if lastCursorRange = @model.getLastCursor()?.getScreenRange()\n       measurableRows.add(lastCursorRange.start.row)\n       measurableRows.add(lastCursorRange.end.row)\n   \n     if longestScreenRow = @model.getLongestScreenRow()\n       measurableRows.add(longestScreenRow)\n   \n     measurableRows\n   ```\n4. Cut non-syntax CSS from styles. Removing `<atom-styles>` does not yield huge speedups, so I am not sure it's the first thing we want to improve. Still an improvement I’d like to make, though. (2257688)\n5. Reduce layout times by trying to modify the measurement context without affecting the whole document. If we manage to always change the DOM in a way that affects only smaller layout boundaries, we may be able to halve reflow times. (28405e09afe097a8f40f90cb2166a47619c8feef)\n\nI believe a combination of 2), 3), 4) and 5) could be interesting. HTML creation (and parsing) and `Layout` are the expensive operations right now and I am thinking to ways in which we could speed them up. I am still kinda making some research but I feel we could reach decent performance if we put some more effort on this. I'll investigate other potential speedups in the meantime. @nathansobo: what do you think?\n#### Conclusion\n\nIf you have read everything so far, I extremely appreciate your attention. I feel like there are many ways to solve this problem, none of which is guaranteed to be the right one, thus I wanted to include as much of my knowledge as possible so that you and the future me can try things out based on it. :pray:\n\nAny feedback would be much appreciated! :bow:
