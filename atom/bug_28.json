On a Mac with 2 monitors, arrange them so that the secondary monitor is positioned higher and to the left of the primary monitor, like so: <img width=\"668\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-07-13 at 5 39 33 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5263654/28193555-934b56be-67f2-11e7-9255-ae81d1e2ea98.png\">\r\n2. Open Atom and mentally note the window size and position.\r\n3. Open settings to ensure that \"Restore Previous Windows On Start\" is set to \"always\".\r\n4. Move Atom's application window fully onto the secondary monitor, so that the top left corner of it is positioned above the height of the primary window. Optionally, resize the window to be noticeably different than the original size. \r\n5. Open the Developer tools and enter `atom.getPosition()` into the console.\r\n6. Observe that the current widow position x and y values are both negative, like so: \r\n![screen shot 2017-07-13 at 5 56 51 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5263654/28193853-eca1fd56-67f4-11e7-99c3-f00acfeca7d0.png)\r\n7. Quit Atom via CMD+Q or via the File menu.\r\n8. Open Atom.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Atom should restore the window position and size due to the \"Restore Previous Windows On Start\" setting.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** The window will open in the position it was in at step 2. \r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100% (if the above steps are followed)\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n**Atom:**\r\nAtom    : 1.18.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.15\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\n**apm:**\r\napm  1.18.1\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.10\r\n\r\n**MacOS:**\r\nSystem Version:\tmacOS 10.12.5 (16F73)\r\nMac Model Identifier:\tMacBookPro13,2 \r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThe issue appears to be caused by an assumption that window positions are calculated relative to the monitor they reside on, not relative to the primary monitor position. The validation logic is found in the `isValidDimensions` method of `atom-environment.coffee` at line 635:\r\n```\r\n# Returns true if the dimensions are useable, false if they should be ignored.\r\n# Work around for https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/issues/473\r\n    isValidDimensions: ({x, y, width, height}={}) ->\r\n    width > 0 and height > 0 and x + width > 0 and y + height > 0\r\n```\r\nThe intent seems to be to prevent saving positions that would place the window outside the viewable area of the monitors, but in our case it generates a false negative due to the way the position data is calculated, and therefore the window position is not saved if your setup is as described above. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15018","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15018/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15018/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15018/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15018","id":242842306,"number":15018,"title":"[Feature Request] in \"menus/*.cson\" read by ContextMenuManager, add support for \"shouldDisplay\" and \"created\"","user":{"login":"warren-bank","id":6810270,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6810270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/warren-bank","html_url":"https://github.com/warren-bank","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warren-bank/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warren-bank/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warren-bank/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warren-bank/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warren-bank/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warren-bank/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warren-bank/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warren-bank/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warren-bank/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-07-13T21:57:23Z","updated_at":"2017-07-20T23:26:58Z","closed_at":"2017-07-20T23:26:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm aware that the JSON (and cson) data format doesn't include a way to serialize and deserialize Function objects.\r\n\r\nNever-the-less, the `ContextMenuManager.add()` accepts an Object and supports some attributes that are expected to be a Function.

#15005.\r\n\r\nPreviously, when `setModel` was called, we forgot to update the pointer to the component in the newly supplied editor. This was causing the element to not update in response to model updates but only as a result of focus or visibility changes. We suspect this regressed during the rewrite of the editor rendering layer.\r\n\r\nWith this pull request we will now correctly swap the element's underlying editor by updating the component pointer on the newly supplied editor. Also, if the element was already attached to another editor, we will null out the component reference on it, because one instance of `TextEditorElement` can only represent one instance of `TextEditor`.\r\n\r\n/cc: @nathansobo @tjfryan

Description of the Change\r\n\r\nAdds support for `onlyHead`, `onlyEmpty` and `omitEmptyLastRow` to custom gutter decorations. \r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\nThis is changing core TextEditorComponent behavior.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\nCurrently scary hacks [like this](https://github.com/steelbrain/linter-ui-default/blob/3b87b59b1d506f195b9703d1a9d0b23ed412e128/lib/editor/index.js#L94) are needed if a package has a custom gutter and wants to have the cursor-line selection highlight extend over the custom gutter.\r\n\r\nThis allows a package to opt-in to a cursor-line on their gutter with (example taken from linter-ui-plus package):\r\n\r\n```js\r\n    this.textEditor.decorateMarkerLayer(this.textEditor.selectionsMarkerLayer, {\r\n      gutterName: 'linter-ui-plus',\r\n      type: 'gutter',\r\n      class: 'line-number

If I remove this line or assign variable in PHP then it's OK. Fix this, I'm having a lot f perception problem in viewing due to this. \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a `.PHP` file.\r\n2. Open `<script>` tag.\r\n3. Assign a PHP number variable to JS number variable (example: `var a = <?php $my ?>`)\r\n4. Now see the `</script>` closing tag, It's colour is black which shouldn't be.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Red colour for `</script> `like as the opening `<script>` tag and HTML tag colors below this.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**  Black colored tags instead of actual colors.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:**  **100%**\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nAtom    : 1.12.7\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\napm  1.12.9\r\nnpm  3.10.5\r\nnode 4.4.5\r\npython 2.7.10\r\ngit 2.5.0\r\n\r\nUBUNTU 15.*\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nNothing\r\n![screenshot from 2017-07-13 13-25-48](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30141967/28156089-d8ef5522-67ce-11e7-8ffe-e6ea75db7c03.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15008","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15008/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15008/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15008/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15008","id":242577489,"number":15008,"title":"Update languages","user":{"login":"50Wliu","id":2766036,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2766036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu","html_url":"https://github.com/50Wliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-07-13T03:47:04Z","updated_at":"2017-07-14T16:47:54Z","closed_at":"2017-07-14T16:47:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/15008","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15008","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15008.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15008.patch"},"body":"### Requirements\r\n\r\n* Filling out the template is required.

Description of the Change\r\n\r\nThis promotes the `.atom-dock-toggle-button-inner` to a GPU layer.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\n- There would be other ways like `transform: translateZ(0)` or `backface-visibility: hidden`, but `will-change` is more official.\r\n- We could also promote the parent element `.atom-dock-toggle-button`, but since the \"inner\" element is the one that actually gets transformed, it seems more appropriate.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nIt's where the dock styles live.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nFixes this rendering issue: #14915\r\n\r\n###
