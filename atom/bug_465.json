But there are folders in our packages called `keymaps/`, implying that these files are called keymaps. It's confusing to have one global thing called keymap that contains a bunch of smaller things that are _also_ called keymaps.\n\nInstead, this PR updates `atom.keymap` to become `atom.keymaps` and the class to be called `KeymapManager`. Methods have been renamed to enforce the idea that files containing bindings are called keymaps.\n\nI've left `atom.keymap` in place as a deprecated property. I'd like to merge this so I can publish the blog post and then start working on a deprecation mechanism that we can use to keep track of where we are using deprecated code paths.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1811/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1810","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1810/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1810/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1810/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/1810","id":30524900,"number":1810,"title":"Double slash sequence triggers errors in .c files","user":{"login":"izuzak","id":38924,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/38924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak","html_url":"https://github.com/izuzak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izuzak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-03-31T16:02:18Z","updated_at":"2014-05-02T23:51:48Z","closed_at":"2014-03-31T18:27:49Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Halp ticket: support/55dbd394b77e11e38c032c4d97cee107\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.

CSS is focused on identifying _individual_ elements, whereas scope selectors are focused on identifying _subtrees_ of the document, which could include multiple elements.\n\nWe've attempted to encode TextMate's `-` operator using `:not` pseudoclasses, but it falls down. Say we're describing the following TextMate scope in CSS:\n\n```\ntext.html .meta.tag - entity.other.attribute-name\n```\n\nThis basically says, I want this to match inside HTML tags, _except_ for inside attribute names. We attempt to translate it to the following incorrect CSS selector:\n\n```\n.text.html .meta.tag:not(.entity.other.attribute-name)\n```\n\nSay we're matching against the following scope chain:\n\n```\n.text.html .meta.tag .entity.other.attribute-name\n```\n\nWe first try matching the `attribute-name`, which fails because no selector matches, so we pop it. Then we try to match the `meta.tag`, and this _does_ match, regardless of the negation.\n\nSo you see that TextMate's `-` operator really can't be encoded with negation. It's operating on subtrees, whereas `:not` operates on individual elements.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1798/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1797","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1797/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1797/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1797/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/1797","id":30143772,"number":1797,"title":"Flicker when switching tabs","user":{"login":"kevinsawicki","id":671378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/671378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinsawicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":84710475,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/editor-rendering","name":"editor-rendering","color":"fef2c0","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-03-25T17:13:20Z","updated_at":"2014-10-31T20:32:19Z","closed_at":"2014-10-31T20:32:19Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Seems to only happen when switching to a single tab in this gif.\n\n![white-flicker](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/671378/2515147/b97f6b9a-b440-11e3-8c46-d67d6b2d48fe.gif)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1797/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4687","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"E9E0:366F:C0ABE8:1777837:59D92DC0","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=466>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=464>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"631f1bebaf8536cc240be82965376e31\"","status":"200 OK"}}
