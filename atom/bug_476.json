PR adds:\n1. An editor spec that randomly mutates a buffer and toggles soft wrap on and off, then compares the screen lines to a simple reference implementation to ensure everything stays in a correct state.\n2. A new and radically simpler implementation of `RowMap` that eliminates all observed failures in the randomized test.\n\nI feel pretty good about this now. The `RowMap` is way simpler now and I can't manage to get any of the failures I was previously driving out with the random spec. It's up to you guys whether you want to merge it while I'm gone. I think it might be worth it. I packaged it as a single commit so you can revert it if unexpected behaviors start cropping up.\n\nIt's worth noting that I added a dev dependency for an npm I'm using in the random spec. I'm not actually sure that's a thing. @kevinsawicki perhaps you can make an adjustment if necessary?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1492/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1491","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1491/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1491/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1491/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/1491","id":26555146,"number":1491,"title":"Prevent scrolling when a space is pressed in editor","user":{"login":"kevinsawicki","id":671378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/671378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinsawicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-01-29T21:30:11Z","updated_at":"2014-01-30T22:57:27Z","closed_at":"2014-01-30T22:57:26Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/1491","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/1491","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/1491.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/1491.patch"},"body":"Closes atom/settings-view#25\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1491/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1490","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1490/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1490/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1490/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/1490","id":26536568,"number":1490,"title":"Add welcome text to the dev tools console.","user":{"login":"probablycorey","id":596,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/596?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey","html_url":"https://github.com/probablycorey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2014-01-29T17:16:07Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T20:09:19Z","closed_at":"2017-09-12T20:09:19Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"When you open a dev tools console from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org) you see this: \n\n![element getboundingclientrect - web api interfaces mdn](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/596/2031978/e7dbc168-8908-11e3-90d2-c3287b27b85d.jpg)\n\nWould a few lines of docs (and ascii art, of course) be helpful for users?

It's still fundamentally a reference.\n- **Tutorials:** Take the key concepts from the developer's manual, break them into concrete examples, and sequence them in an easy-to-follow way. I'm thinking these can be based around explaining how to build one or more of our core packages.\n- **API Reference:** This is the docs generated from our source comments.\n\nI'd like to create empty files for any documentation we have missing, maybe just with the headings in place.

I ran into the following issue while working on atom/tree-view#34; do the following to reproduce:\n1. Clone [BinaryMuse/tree-view](https://github.com/BinaryMuse/tree-view) into `~/.atom/dev/packages/tree-view` and switch to the `bt-copy-paths` branch.\n2. Fire up Atom with `atom -d` and, with a file open and focus in the editor, press `ctrl-C`. Notice that the path of the file has been copied into the clipboard by `editor:copy-path`.\n3. Focus the tree view and select a different entry without changing the open file. With the tree view focused, press `ctrl-C`. Notice that the clipboard still contains the path to the currently open file, even though the `bkt-copy-paths` branch specifies that `ctrl-C` for `.tree-view` should execute `tree-view:copy-full-path`.\n\nThis happens because `ApplicationMenu` determines the specific command to execute when the menu item is clicked, without consulting the keymap specificity rules; this seems necessary for commands that are handled by `AtomApplication`.\n\nThis pull request introduces a change that sends the _keystroke_ to `WindowEventHandler`, instead of the command, in the case where `AtomApplication` does not handle the command itself.\n\nSpecs pass and things appear to work, but I'm not sure of the wider repercussions of this change, and would love to get some eyes on it. For one thing, since menu commands may now trigger different commands based on specificity, there may be a disconnect between what the menu item says and what it actually does. (This is okay for my example, where `ctrl-C` is bound to \"Copy Path\" in the menu, which makes sense in the new tree view context, but a user could easily rebind commands so that they no longer make sense--but maybe we don't care.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1481/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1480","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1480/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1480/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/1480/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/1480","id":26284132,"number":1480,"title":"Clean
