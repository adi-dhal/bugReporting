The result is an inability to scroll to the end of the rendered line.\n\n![scroll width calc](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1789/3323365/703d93c2-f760-11e3-90b6-fd659df1a4c6.gif)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2666/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2665","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2665/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2665/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2665/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2665","id":36041934,"number":2665,"title":"Implement gutter clicking and dragging to change selection on react editor","user":{"login":"benogle","id":69169,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/69169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle","html_url":"https://github.com/benogle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2014-06-19T01:06:44Z","updated_at":"2014-06-19T20:56:20Z","closed_at":"2014-06-19T20:48:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/2665","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2665","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2665.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2665.patch"},"body":"Handles:\n- clicking on gutter row\n- shift clicking on gutter row\n- dragging on gutter row\n- shift dragging on gutter row\n\nFixes #2636 \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2665/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2664","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2664/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2664/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2664/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2664","id":36038905,"number":2664,"title":"Error closing tabs quickly","user":{"login":"kevinsawicki","id":671378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/671378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinsawicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-06-18T23:58:23Z","updated_at":"2014-06-19T21:25:19Z","closed_at":"2014-06-19T21:25:19Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"I often close tabs by holding down `cmd-w`.\n\nWhen doing this today with ~10 React editor tabs open I got 7 of these:\n\n```\nEditorScrollView scroll position changed, and it shouldn't have.
