When restoring the previous state we attach the workspace along with the needed `TextEditorElement`s. When `TextEditorComponent` gets instantiated, it uses `isInitialLoadComplete` to decide whether it should listen to `ThemeManager::onDidChangeActiveThemes`, which is what triggers `::refreshScrollbars` after e.g. `one-dark-ui` loads.\n\nSince `::isInitialLoadComplete` was true before the themes had the chance to actually being loaded, we weren't refreshing scrollbars at all, thus not allowing webkit to apply the needed stylesheets (when we refresh the scrollbars we explicitly trigger a reflow to let Chrome handle stylesheets correctly).\n\nThis PR changes the existing behavior so that we mark the initial theme load as complete only in test mode (through a configurable option).\n\n/cc: @nathansobo @atom/feedback \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9575/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9574","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9574/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9574/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9574/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9574","id":116803969,"number":9574,"title":"When opening multiple files Atom (1.3.0.beta0) creates a new window for each file","user":{"login":"fabiospampinato","id":1812093,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1812093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato","html_url":"https://github.com/fabiospampinato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiospampinato/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":163641905,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/atom","name":"atom","color":"f7c6c7","default":false},{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"nathansobo","id":1789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo","html_url":"https://github.com/nathansobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"assignees":[{"login":"nathansobo","id":1789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo","html_url":"https://github.com/nathansobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-11-13T16:39:14Z","updated_at":"2015-11-18T19:08:51Z","closed_at":"2015-11-18T19:08:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"In Atom 1.2.0 when I opened a lot of files at once from the finder it was just adding them to a previously opened window.

If so I'd like to point out that those files where all part of a folder that had already an Atom window, if you want to keep this \"feature\" at least you should notice it, and in that case attach them to the already opened window.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9574/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9573","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9573/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9573/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9573/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9573","id":116801636,"number":9573,"title":"atom 1.2.0 release cannot start as root","user":{"login":"SlimeQ","id":3934698,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3934698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimeQ","html_url":"https://github.com/SlimeQ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimeQ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimeQ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimeQ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimeQ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimeQ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimeQ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimeQ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimeQ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimeQ/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":97577987,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/linux","name":"linux","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-11-13T16:26:07Z","updated_at":"2015-12-17T07:14:26Z","closed_at":"2015-12-17T07:14:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"just upgraded to 1.2.0 release and suddenly can't run as root.\n\nthis is on an Ubuntu 14.04 fresh install\n\n1.1.0 does not have this issue\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9572","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9572/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9572/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9572/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9572","id":116785199,"number":9572,"title":"Possible Startup Improvements","user":{"login":"as-cii","id":482957,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/482957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii","html_url":"https://github.com/as-cii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":52925411,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/performance","name":"performance","color":"d4c5f9","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2015-11-13T15:04:55Z","updated_at":"2016-12-15T10:10:42Z","closed_at":"2016-12-15T10:10:41Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"This issue is aimed at listing and evaluating some speedups we could potentially employ on startup.

We can even think giving a way for people to switch between channels as needed (given the user config stay backward compatible). I'm happy to work on those 2 problematics after/if this PR is merged at some point.\n- if all dependencies are installed in the distribution, the atom installation is then just a question of extracting an archive, requiring non root permission contrary to the .deb or .rpm packages.\n\nWe can then integrate this archive to be downloaded to some tools like Ubuntu Make (https://github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-make/issues/6).\n\nWe generate a .tar.gz compressed archive (we could switch to a more performant .tar.xz, but the first format is more widespread and usual). I did add the `mktar` to the `CI task` (I saw the rpm wasn't in there, so I guess, it's only running on an Ubuntu machine) and tested it. I did add the task as well to `upload-assets`, but of course, I couldn't test it ;) The changes there are though minimal, but I can modify what's necessary as needed.\n\nAs _version_ contains _upstream version + channel name_, I didn't change anything in the naming of the archive publication, and the folder in archive contains thus an uniquely defined build.\n\nOf course, the resulting archive is linked against the libraries available in the builder version. mktar is run where the .deb is built, which is, I guess, the latest ubuntu LTS. I tried the built archive on 14.04 LTS, 15.04, 15.10 and xenial (dev version), and everything is working as expected. If this doesn't work on other distros (which, looking at the deps, seems unlikely and we already only have one deb for debian/ubuntu and one rpm for fedora/opensuse…), we can build multiple archives. But I propose we starts with this one.\n\nI'm happy to do any changes that you feel are necessary!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9554/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9553","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9553/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9553/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9553/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9553","id":116693392,"number":9553,"title":"atom becomes unresponsive after opening a file with many lines","user":{"login":"Yomi0","id":3170531,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3170531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yomi0","html_url":"https://github.com/Yomi0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yomi0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yomi0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yomi0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yomi0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yomi0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yomi0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yomi0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yomi0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yomi0/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-11-13T03:28:44Z","updated_at":"2015-11-13T04:55:09Z","closed_at":"2015-11-13T04:55:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"To reproduce\n1.
