After investigating, it seems that there is a mismatch between the way that the GitHub installer installs Git on Windows (Windows 7 in this case) and the way that Atom expects to find Git.\n\nGitHub is installing Git as a \"ClickOnce Application Reference\". It does not get it's own place on the system path, and the deeply nested directory where it is located has a hellishly long name that is not conducive to being added to the path. See below for a partial image of that directory. Notice the path information displayed at the top is only partial!\n\nAll of the advice that I found for solving issues of this sort involve adding the Git directory to the system's path, but that is not practical with the way GitHub currently installs itself. Is there another solution?\n\nThanks for your help.\n\nGeorge\n\n---\n\nInstalling “Sublime-Style-Column-Selection@1.1.3” failed.Hide output…\n\nnpm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/emissary\nnpm http 304 https://registry.npmjs.org/emissary\nnpm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/mixto\nnpm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/property-accessors\nnpm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/underscore-plus\nnpm ERR! not found: git\nnpm ERR! \nnpm ERR!

The weakness with this approach is that it depended on the load order of the first style sheet from each group. This caused a bug where the context-targeted style sheets for atom-text-editor would get out of order with the bundled style sheets coming _after_ the theme style sheets, causing the bracket matcher styling to be wrong. Using numbers explicitly ensures that style sheets always land in the expected order. Floating point values can be used at a later point to precisely position style sheets into the cascade if desired. I did a full scan of all packages and did not detect a dependency on the grouping API, which is private anyway.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4878","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4878/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4878/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4878/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4878","id":53592379,"number":4878,"title":"When rename file, paste a string with LF cause bug","user":{"login":"lijunle","id":1296500,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1296500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijunle","html_url":"https://github.com/lijunle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijunle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijunle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijunle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijunle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijunle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijunle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijunle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijunle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lijunle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-01-07T03:07:50Z","updated_at":"2015-01-07T04:28:01Z","closed_at":"2015-01-07T03:14:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"![untitled](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1296500/5640185/3bbc1552-961a-11e4-9a45-b2145acc2a97.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4877","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4877/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4877/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4877/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/4877","id":53588632,"number":4877,"title":":memo: Add section on apm unlink to debugging doc","user":{"login":"lee-dohm","id":1038121,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1038121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm","html_url":"https://github.com/lee-dohm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-01-07T02:00:15Z","updated_at":"2015-01-07T02:04:46Z","closed_at":"2015-01-07T02:01:14Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/4877","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/4877","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/4877.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/4877.patch"},"body":"@kevinsawicki mentioned that his first debugging step to check is `apm unlink -a`.
