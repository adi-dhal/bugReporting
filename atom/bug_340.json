issuing an XCompose sequence that involves a key on a shift level higher than 2, Atom ignores the input.\n\nE. g., my parentheses are on level 3 of my keyboard layout. Now, when issuing `Compose+(+(`, which normally produces the character `⦅`, Atom produces no output.\n\nBelow is the xev output for this sequence. Generally, all XCompose sequences using keys that are not on levels 1 or 2 are ignored. The other sequences (base level and level-1 shift) do work, however.\n\n```\nKeyPress event, serial 28, synthetic NO, window 0x3000001,\n    root 0x2bb, subw 0x0, time 5189912, (405,539),

To recap, the following is a brief explanation of how the solution works.\n\nWhen lines with an indentation are soft wrapped, they are prepended with a phantom token which is as long as the indentation of the original line. This token is not selectable, nor reachable by the cursor. I had to change how `DisplayBuffer#clipScreenPosition` worked, since I could not treat the phantom token as an hard tab. I'd like to remark that this is still experimental code, but based on my tests I can confirm it works pretty well.\n\n~~There's a subtle bug, though, which needs to be addressed and which I'll be looking at soon after creating this pull request. When a line is indented but no space is present, Atom freezes: I am quite sure this is due to how soft wrapping works on lines without spaces (namely, lines without words). I am quite sure this can be fixed easily, it just needs some more attention (and a better knowledge of the codebase).~~\n\nThanks everyone in advance for the support!\n\n/cc: @atom/core\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5567/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5566","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5566/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5566/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5566/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5566","id":57726105,"number":5566,"title":"First start: 4 atom apps running: --eval require('...source-maps')","user":{"login":"m1ga","id":4334997,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4334997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1ga","html_url":"https://github.com/m1ga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1ga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1ga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1ga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1ga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1ga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1ga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1ga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1ga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1ga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":52925411,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/performance","name":"performance","color":"d4c5f9","default":false},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2015-02-15T10:43:12Z","updated_at":"2017-08-20T13:08:58Z","closed_at":"2017-08-20T13:08:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When I start atom for the first time I have a very high disc io.
