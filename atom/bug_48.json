Have a directory and file with differing cases on a case in-sensitive filesystem.\r\n    * For example: `C:\\Temp\\CapDir\\CapFile.txt` on Windows.\r\n2. Open Atom using the wrong case for the directory.\r\n    * For example: `atom C:\\temp\\capdir`\r\n3. Open the file in the directory\r\n4. Run `atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor().getPath()` from the Developer Tools and note the incorrect case on the path.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nRunning the above command should output `C:\\Temp\\CapDir\\CapFile.txt` regardless of what command was used to launch Atom.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\nAny part of the path that was manually specified is taken as verbatim and not corrected to reflect the actual case on the file system. The above steps for example show `C:\\temp\\capdir\\CapFile.txt` as the path to the file.\r\n\r\nThis causes problems with packages that rely on the correct path, including the case, to be returned such as linters that check for cross platform case issues on case-insensitive filesystems where it would normally not show for the user.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:**\r\n\r\n100% of the time.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nTested locally on Windows 10 x64:\r\nAtom    : 1.17.0-beta5\r\nElectron: 1.3.15\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\nNote that this investigation initially started from a user on macOS Sierra 10.12.3 (16D32) in https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import/issues/831.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nAny part of the path that _isn't_ manually specified is handled correctly, for example if the CLI is in `C:\\Temp` and Atom is called with `atom capdir` then the resulting path is `C:\\Temp\\capdir\\CapFile.txt`.\r\n\r\nRelated to https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8221.\r\n\r\nTagging @lee-dohm as requested.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14402/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14401","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14401/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14401/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14401/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14401","id":228335285,"number":14401,"title":"[Linux] Dragging a file or folder into Atom does not work","user":{"login":"mofux","id":2785983,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2785983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mofux","html_url":"https://github.com/mofux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mofux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mofux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mofux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mofux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mofux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mofux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mofux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mofux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mofux/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":258255692,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/electron","name":"electron","color":"A5ECFA","default":false},{"id":97577987,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/linux","name":"linux","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":171329633,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-reproduction","name":"needs-reproduction","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2017-05-12T15:56:30Z","updated_at":"2017-06-20T20:37:42Z","closed_at":"2017-06-20T20:37:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

Setting a keykinding to the following values responds when the listed keys are pressed:\r\n\r\n- `cmd-shift-P`: cmd-shift-p\r\n- `cmd-P`: cmd-shift-p\r\n- `cmd-shift-p`: cmd-shift-p\r\n\r\nWhen a capital letter is listed in the keymap, `shift` must be pressed to use that command, meaning that all commands `x-shift-p`, `x-shift-P`, and `x-P` are effectively the same. This is an inconsistency because listing a capital letter forces an implied `shift` key to be used, while using a lowercase letter and listing an explicit `shift` key is fine.\r\n\r\nThus:\r\n\r\n- `cmd-shift-p == cmd-shift-P`\r\n- `cmd-p != cmd-P`\r\n- `cmd-shift-p == cmd-P`\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. In `keymap.cson`, add the lines:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'atom-workspace atom-pane':\r\n  # 'cmd-shift-P': 'pane:decrease-size'\r\n  # 'cmd-shift-p': 'pane:decrease-size'\r\n  # 'cmd-P': 'pane:decrease-size'\r\n  # 'cmd-p': 'pane:decrease-size'\r\n```\r\n2. Uncomment each line individually and try pressing the combinations:\r\n\r\n- `command, shift, p`\r\n- `command, p`\r\n\r\nto see how Atom responds to each.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\n- The pane decreases when either of the lines `cmd-shift-P` or `cmd-shift-p` are uncommented and `command, shift, p` are pressed.\r\n- The pane decreases when either of the lines `cmd-P` or `cmd-p` are uncommented and `command, p` are pressed.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\n- The pane decreases when any of the lines `cmd-shift-P`, `cmd-shift-p`, `cmd-P` are uncommented and `command, shift, p` are pressed.\r\n- The pane decreases when the line `cmd-p` is uncommented and `command, p` are pressed.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Consistently according to this pattern.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.16.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nn/a","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14395","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14395/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14395/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14395/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14395","id":228021987,"number":14395,"title":"How can I open a file in the same tab using cmd+p?","user":{"login":"jim-moody","id":26190589,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/26190589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jim-moody","html_url":"https://github.com/jim-moody","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jim-moody/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jim-moody/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jim-moody/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jim-moody/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jim-moody/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jim-moody/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jim-moody/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jim-moody/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jim-moody/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-05-11T15:00:09Z","updated_at":"2017-05-11T20:19:56Z","closed_at":"2017-05-11T20:19:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [ X] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, every time I use cmd+p to open a file in Atom, it creates a new tab which leads to tab overload.\r\n\r\nI am looking for a way to open a file using cmd+p and have it replace the file I am currently viewing.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

Switch to custom title bar on macos and restart\r\n2. open a document\r\n3. cmd-click in document title in titlebar. A path pop up should appear, but doesn't.\r\n4. drag the document icon, a document proxy should appear for drag and drop, but doesn't.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\n\r\nI expect the path popup to appear, as it does in default mode, and I expect the document proxy to appear, as it does in default mode.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\n\r\nNeither appear. This is perhaps refered to by \"Custom\" will affect functionality, but as nice as it is, this is a bridge to far, i'm just wondering if the authors are unaware of this default behaviour.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\n\r\nEvery time.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n1.16.0 x64 for Mac OS X.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14390/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14389","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14389/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14389/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14389/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14389","id":227922260,"number":14389,"title":"option to always retain unsaved buffers no matter what","user":{"login":"dwelle","id":5153846,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5153846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwelle","html_url":"https://github.com/dwelle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwelle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwelle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwelle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwelle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwelle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwelle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwelle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwelle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwelle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-05-11T08:56:34Z","updated_at":"2017-05-17T21:25:46Z","closed_at":"2017-05-17T21:25:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"__Problem:__\r\n\r\nCurrently, unsaved buffers (by that I mean new, unsaved, unnamed buffers with notes etc.) are somewhat loosely associated with atom project.\r\n\r\nWhen you open a new project in a new window, the unsaved buffers are not opened/transferred to that window (whether it's a good thing is subjective). When you close that project (window), those unsaved buffers are (AFAIK) irreversibly lost.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how the unsaved buffers are retained between atom sessions, but if you happen to close the project as stated above, and then do `File → Reopen project`, the unsaved buffers created within that project __are not restored__.\r\n\r\nI can't express how many times I've lost work due to atom not re-opening active project (even though it's been mostly fixed [there's so many related issues that I don't keep track] it happens to me every other week or so), thus losing unsaved buffers. I've since learned to keep my most important code-snippets-to-be-processed-later in a saved buffer, but I'm pretty lazy so I forget to do that all the time.
