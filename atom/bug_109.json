We adopted the same heuristic for the new build scripts, but didn't notice that Travis always sets the `TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST` variable to \"false\" (which causes the `process.env.TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST` expression to be evaluated as truthy).\n\nIn the past, this wasn't a problem because we were building artifacts via Janky, but after switching to Travis this makes it generate the wrong assets on stable and beta.\n\nTo fix this, it seems reasonable to remove the conditional that checks if we are building a pull-request: in the past this could have been problematic because assets could be uploaded inadvertently to S3 or GitHub, but this should be safe now that we rely on the release publisher to perform that task.\n\n/cc: @nathansobo @joefitzgerald

both installed in the /opt directory. If I remove guest additions, atom opens and loads just fine. However, if I install guest additions and then reboot, atom opens, but does not load/render correctly. It opens but only has a black/gray pixelated window and is unusable. As soon as I remove the guest additions directory, Atom opens and loads perfectly. I have tested this in safe mode as well.\n\nInstalling Atom from the Ubuntu repo (which installs version 1.0.11) works perfect with guest additions installed. In order to install the newest version of Atom, I have to remove the /opt directory to avoid the warnings that Atom couldn't install properly, then reinstall Atom, and then reinstall guest additions, in which case Atom no longer loads/renders correctly. I also tried to install Atom using the webupd8/atom ppa, and have the same issues. \n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Install Atom\n2. Install Guest Additions\n3. Reboot\n4. Start Atom\n### Versions\n\nOS (Guest): Bodhi 3.2.1 (Ubuntu 14.04)\nVirtualBox Guest Additions 5.1.4\nAtom 1.9.9\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12574/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12573","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12573/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12573/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12573/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12573","id":174413868,"number":12573,"title":"Tildify

Sometimes when coding HTML and php it indents in ways it not supposed to. \nExample: \n\n``` html\n<html>\n    <head>\n        <title>My glitchy workspace</title>\n    </head>\n        <body>\n            <h1> Hi</h1>\n        </body\n</html>\n```\n\nYou can see how it thinks `<body>` is a child of `<head>`\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Code. Try and let atom do the indention\n\n**Expected behavior:** For code to be formatted\n**Actual behavior:** Code indents wrong\n### Versions\n\nAll\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12568/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12567","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12567/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12567/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12567/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12567","id":174359517,"number":12567,"title":"Type assit in commentes","user":{"login":"xXXIMMATTHEWXXx","id":14029405,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/14029405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xXXIMMATTHEWXXx","html_url":"https://github.com/xXXIMMATTHEWXXx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xXXIMMATTHEWXXx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xXXIMMATTHEWXXx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xXXIMMATTHEWXXx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xXXIMMATTHEWXXx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xXXIMMATTHEWXXx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xXXIMMATTHEWXXx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xXXIMMATTHEWXXx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xXXIMMATTHEWXXx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xXXIMMATTHEWXXx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-08-31T19:36:54Z","updated_at":"2016-08-31T20:34:44Z","closed_at":"2016-08-31T20:34:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [✓] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n- [✓] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [✓] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [✓] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [✓] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [✓] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n\nFor more information on how to write a good [bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) or [enhancement request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\nWhile typing [this ](http://hastebin.com/ejijaverow.md) comment,\nI had a lot of trouble. When i would type words \nlike server and code then hit enter to start a new\nline, it would put a code piece. So if i typed server\nthen hit enter to start a new line it would set server \nto SoapServer.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Type a comment. Words like server and code trigger it\n\n**Expected behavior:** Not auto type code pieces when i am commenting\n\n**Actual behavior:** It tries to auto type code when im writing comments. This becomes annoying when you work as a team and you are commenting code for others.\n###
