When atom opens a mounted cryptomator vault (which is mapped to a network drive locally) it tries to index the hidden folders (named \".\" and \"..\"). This indexing never stops since atom is trying to index the hidden folders that contain the cryptomator metadata. This occurs on Windows 10 Pro. The issue is not present on OSX.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Clone any repo (e.g. https://github.com/twitter/heron)\n2. Install cryptomator (https://cryptomator.org/downloads/#winDownload). Java client does not require installation.\n3. Create a new vault in cryptomator for the heron repo\n4. Mount the vault\n5. Open the network drive (usually Z: drive) in atom\n6. Try to find a file (Ctrl-P). Atom says \"indexing\" forever. Ctrl-P is broken and you can't find any files in the project.\n\nI've also tried adding \".\" and \"..\" to the ignored folders list in settings (and enabled \"hide hidden folders\" in tree-view plugin). This doesn't make a difference and these folders are not hidden.\n\n**Expected behavior:**\nAtom should quickly index the repo. It takes ~2 seconds to index the non-encrypted heron repo. \n\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\nAtom tries to index these hidden folders. Indexing goes on forever because it's trying to index a deep structure of hidden folders.\n### Versions\n\n1.7.4 (windows 10 pro x64 machine)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11879","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11879/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11879/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11879/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11879","id":158025334,"number":11879,"title":"1.8.4 fails to install on Windows 10, while 1.7.4 install just fine","user":{"login":"rafaelrenanpacheco","id":12160864,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/12160864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelrenanpacheco","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelrenanpacheco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelrenanpacheco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelrenanpacheco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelrenanpacheco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelrenanpacheco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelrenanpacheco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelrenanpacheco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelrenanpacheco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelrenanpacheco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelrenanpacheco/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true},{"id":176631763,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/installer","name":"installer","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":62363277,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2016-06-01T22:56:02Z","updated_at":"2016-06-08T20:25:28Z","closed_at":"2016-06-08T20:25:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi there!\n\nWhen attempting to install 1.8.4 beta on a Windows 10 machine, I get the following error:\n\nSquirrelSetup.log\n\n```\n2016-06-01 19:30:21> Program: Starting Squirrel Updater: --install .\n2016-06-01 19:30:21> Program: Starting install, writing to C:\\Users\\Rafael Renan Pacheco\\AppData\\Local\\SquirrelTemp\n2016-06-01 19:30:21> Program: About to install to: C:\\Users\\Rafael Renan Pacheco\\AppData\\Local\\atom\n2016-06-01 19:30:23> CheckForUpdateImpl: Failed to load local releases, starting from scratch: System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException: Não foi possível localizar uma parte do caminho 'C:\\Users\\Rafael Renan Pacheco\\AppData\\Local\\atom\\packages\\RELEASES'.\n   em System.IO.__Error.WinIOError(Int32 errorCode, String maybeFullPath)\n   em System.IO.FileStream.Init(String path, FileMode mode, FileAccess access, Int32 rights, Boolean useRights, FileShare share, Int32 bufferSize, FileOptions options, SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES secAttrs, String msgPath, Boolean bFromProxy, Boolean useLongPath, Boolean checkHost)\n   em System.IO.FileStream..ctor(String path, FileMode mode, FileAccess access, FileShare share)\n   em Squirrel.Utility.LoadLocalReleases(String localReleaseFile)\n   em Squirrel.UpdateManager.CheckForUpdateImpl.<CheckForUpdate>d__3f.MoveNext()\n```\n\nLooks like it was caused by the user dir having spaces in it, but this is a normal behavior in Windows 10 machines, and should not fail to install.

I'm a researcher studying software evolution. As part of my current research, I'm studying the implications of open-sourcing a proprietary software, for instance, if the project succeed in attracting newcomers Atom was in my list. \n\nTo further analyze the impacts of Atom’s migration, we analyzed the git log commit history of your project in terms of _number of contributions_, _number of newcomers_, and _number of contributors per month_. The following figure presents a temporal perspective regarding these three measures. \n\n![atom](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/235062/15728231/1bf2b7b0-2810-11e6-9636-319e9fd20c87.png)\n\nGiven the numbers presented in the graphic, we would like to ask Atom developers the following questions:\n1. What motivated the project to open its source code at Github? How do you evaluate the benefits of this migration?\n2. Does this snapshot make sense? Did you find any inconsistency on the data?\n3. Do you have any internal policy to promote/attract/retain newcomers? If so, do them succeed?\n4. Why the number of contribution did not increase while the number of contributors increased?\n5. Did you expect an increasing number of newcomers joining the project right after it became open-source?\n\nThanks in advance for your collaboration,\n\nGustavo Pinto, PhD\nhttp://www.gustavopinto.org\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11877","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11877/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11877/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11877/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11877","id":158012307,"number":11877,"title":"Ctrl-/ doesn't work ","user":{"login":"fferrin","id":7387552,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7387552?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fferrin","html_url":"https://github.com/fferrin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fferrin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fferrin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fferrin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fferrin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fferrin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fferrin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fferrin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fferrin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fferrin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-06-01T21:33:57Z","updated_at":"2016-12-02T05:58:20Z","closed_at":"2016-12-02T05:58:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When I press ctrl+/, comment doesn't work.

Merging them allows more control and adjustments can be made directly. Also, moving out of core and into a separate package feels less intimidating and can easier be rolled back in `package.json`.\n## Concerns\n\nSome styles got removed, so there is a chance that something might look unstyled or off. Packages bundled with Atom should be fine, but it's hard to predict if community packages rely on any of the removed styles. Maybe in the Beta phase we can catch some regressions.\n\nAffected packages:\n- [x] `autocomplete-plus` fixed by [reverting](https://github.com/atom/atom-ui/pull/4) some refactoring.\n- [x] [godoc](https://github.com/zmb3/godoc/pull/17) uses `.close`.

I didn't try it in safe mode, because it's irrelevant. If safe mode uses the default keybindings, then it will be broken there too.  \n- [ X ] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n\nI am using the latest version.

For instance ...\n\n[alt] 0169 = ©\n[alt] 0128 = €\n[alt] 0140 = Œ\n[alt] 0174 = ®\n[alt] 0216 = Ø\n\netc... However, the default keymappings use [alt] <number> to switch between tabs, so when you have multiple documents open in multiple tabs, typing [alt] 0169 results in the editor switching to the first tab, then the sixth tab, then the ninth one (or the last one if you don't have nine open), then when you release the [alt] key, the desired character is inserted in the wrong document.  \n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. open the Atom editor with multiple documents in multiple tabs.\n2. Choose a document to insert a Ø into.\n3. hold the [alt] key down and type 0216 then release the [alt] key.\n\nThe tab selection will bounce around as you type the digits, then the character will most likely be inserted into the wrong document.  \n\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]\n\nI expect Atom to stay on the document I am Editing. Atom should respect default Windows keystrokes, and not implement breaking behavior.    \n\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\n\nThe tab selection bounces around as you type the digits, then the character will inserted into the wrong document.  \n### Versions\n\nAtom    : 1.7.4\nElectron: 0.36.8\nChrome  : 47.0.2526.110\nNode    : 5.1.1\n\napm  1.9.2\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython\ngit 2.8.1.windows.1\nvisual studio\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11872/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11871","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11871/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11871/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11871/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11871","id":157744737,"number":11871,"title":"\"The editor has crashed\" after editing remote files with FileZilla","user":{"login":"SK83RJOSH","id":1371787,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1371787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SK83RJOSH","html_url":"https://github.com/SK83RJOSH","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SK83RJOSH/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SK83RJOSH/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SK83RJOSH/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SK83RJOSH/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SK83RJOSH/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SK83RJOSH/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SK83RJOSH/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SK83RJOSH/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SK83RJOSH/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":153145129,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/crash","name":"crash","color":"e11d21","default":false},{"id":62363277,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-05-31T18:57:55Z","updated_at":"2017-03-08T20:46:24Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nWhen exiting Atom after editing and uploading a file through FileZilla the editor fails to exit cleanly.\n\nThis occurs regardless of whether or not all files have been closed out in Atom before exiting, but only if they've been deleted by FileZilla through the \"Finish editing and delete local file.\" option. Upon opening atom the next time there may sometimes be a tab left over for the file you were last editing. After this occurs once the editor can sometimes crash on subsequent exits and start ups.\n\nI'm wondering if this has anything to do with filelocks and whether or not this issue is with the treeview (as opposed to atom core).\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open a remote file with FileZilla while ensuring Atom selected as the default editor\n2. Save the file in Atom\n3. When FileZilla prompts you to do so, select \"Finish editing and delete local file.\"\n4. Exit Atom\n\n**Expected behavior:** The editor should exit successfully.\n\n**Actual behavior:** The editor fails to exit cleanly.\n### Versions\n\n1.8.0-beta4 on Windows

When Atom is closed and I open a file with Atom from Windows File Explorer, it opens the file in Atom and replaces my Project Folders, making the file name a Project in the Tree View and then I have to add all my Project Folders again.\r\n\r\nI've always wanted to report this issue but I thought it would be fixed sooner.\r\n\r\nSome help would be appreciated. Thanks.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Atom keeps my project folders\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Project folders disappear and filename becomes a folder\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11868","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11868/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11868/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11868/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11868","id":157564997,"number":11868,"title":"Atom opens with blank screen and Chrome developer tools","user":{"login":"myou11","id":16094260,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/16094260?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myou11","html_url":"https://github.com/myou11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myou11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myou11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myou11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myou11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myou11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myou11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myou11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myou11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myou11/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":17,"created_at":"2016-05-30T23:06:54Z","updated_at":"2016-05-30T23:51:40Z","closed_at":"2016-05-30T23:51:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- [ Y ] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode)?\n- [ Y ] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [ Y ] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [ Y ] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [ Y ] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [ Y ] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n\nOS: Windows 7\nAtom: v1.7.4\n\nI was using Atom just fine until today when I was messing around with my GitHub installation in my AppData folder.

Don't merge all PRs, only pick one. ⚠️ \n\nThis moves Bootstrap (and some core components) to a separate package. \n\nRefs: #6351, #8237 \n### Stays in core `atom/atom/static`:\n- [x] Octicons\n- [x] Normalize\n- [x] Scaffolding\n- [x] Cursors\n- [x] Panels\n- [x] Panes\n- [x] Syntax\n- [x] `text-editor-light`\n- [x] `workspace-view`\n### Moved + merged into the [atom/ui](https://github.com/atom/ui) package:\n- [x] Tooltips\n- [x] Buttons + Button Groups\n- [x] Lists\n- [x] Code\n- [x] Nav\n- [x] Scaffolding\n- [x] Utilities\n- [x] Alerts\n- [x] Tables\n- [x] Forms\n- [x] Type\n- [x] Normalize\n- [x] Clean up some un-used styles. Like IE hacks etc.\n### Removed:\n- 🔥  grid\n- 🔥  input-groups\n- 🔥  labels\n- 🔥  thumbnails\n- 🔥  close\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently we load Bootstrap and then try to override it in core. Moving some of it into its own package allows more control and adjustments can be made directly. Also, making changes in a separate package feels less intimidating and can easier be rolled back in `package.json`.\n## Concerns\n\nWhat happens if you disable the UI package?\n\n![ui](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378023/15624689/ea3cc9c0-24c9-11e6-97cc-2e03d430279e.gif)\n\nBecause the main layout styles are still in core and themes override a lot of the components, it doesn't look too broken. Just a few things seem off or un-styled. For the tree-view or nav in the settings, we could remove the list styles in those packages to make a bit more robust. Being able to disable the UI package might inspire the community to create their own version or add additional components.\n\nSome styles got removed, so there is a chance that something might look unstyled or off. Packages bundled with Atom should be fine, but it's hard to predict if community packages rely on any of the removed styles. Maybe in the Beta phase we can catch some regressions.\n\n@atom/design @atom/core\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11858/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11857","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11857/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11857/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11857/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11857","id":157293353,"number":11857,"title":"HTML syntax highlighting breaking at non-word characters","user":{"login":"coreybruyere","id":3430222,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3430222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreybruyere","html_url":"https://github.com/coreybruyere","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreybruyere/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreybruyere/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreybruyere/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreybruyere/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreybruyere/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreybruyere/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreybruyere/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreybruyere/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreybruyere/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-05-27T21:25:26Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T22:00:41Z","closed_at":"2016-05-27T22:00:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm seeing this on all UI and syntax themes:\n\n<img width=\"971\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-05-27 at 2 02 57 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3430222/15621453/e2bf2e36-2415-11e6-8f5a-c856674e1f8c.png\">\n\nHere's the current packages I'm using:\n\n<img width=\"1023\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-05-27 at 2 24 49 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3430222/15621589/cd666486-2416-11e6-96ac-6def70141413.png\">\n- Running Atom 1.7.4\n- Same thing occurred in safe mode\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11857/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11856","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11856/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11856/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11856/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11856","id":157283025,"number":11856,"title":"Regex's in a grammar don't work over multiple lines","user":{"login":"serialhex","id":500833,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/500833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/serialhex","html_url":"https://github.com/serialhex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serialhex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serialhex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serialhex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serialhex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serialhex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serialhex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serialhex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serialhex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serialhex/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true},{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-05-27T20:16:39Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T20:24:09Z","closed_at":"2016-05-27T20:19:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm making a syntax highlighter for Common Lisp, and one of the things I've noticed is that a regex will not work over multiple lines.
