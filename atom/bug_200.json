Designing, coding and supporting all the possible implementations that the community asserts should be \"the default\" is too daunting a task. Some examples of Issues like this are:\n- Behavior when closing the last open file or last open window (#863, #7835, https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2411#issuecomment-44497175, #7726)\n- Behavior when opening files via drag-and-drop, from the command line, whether inside or outside of the project folder ... whether there is a \"project\" or not, etc\n- Sorting behavior in the Tree View\n- Undo/Redo behavior\n- Fuzzy matching (https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10266)\n\nAdditionally, adding configuration options for all the possible permutations of these behaviors is hard to design and difficult for users to understand.\n\nBecause of these challenges, I wanted to design a system that:\n1. Keeps the base installation of Atom simpler and more approachable for new users\n2. Allows for maximum configurability in keeping with the \"hackable to the core\" philosophy of Atom\n3. Removes the necessity of the Atom Core team supporting _all_ possible options\n## How It Works\n\nWhen a feature (described as \"foo\" in this example) is identified for this approach:\n1. A \"behavior service\" should be designed and built into Atom Core as: `atom.foo-behavior`\n2. The current behavior should be used as a fallback in the case that no service provides an alternative (see the `atom.file-icons` service in the [tree-view package](https://github.com/atom/tree-view) as an example)\n3. By convention, packages that implement alternatives will end with `foo-behavior` like `my-awesome-foo-behavior`\n4. Any interested party implements a package that provides the service to customize Atom's behavior\n## Benefits\n\nWith this system in use, anyone can easily come along and implement their own behavior for this particular feature without:\n1. Needing to describe the behavior in detail (the best specification is code, after all)\n2. Needing to convince anyone that this is a good idea or \"deserves to be in core\"\n\nThis also allows for Atom to act in a manner that is perhaps more familiar and comfortable to the user but goes against the conventions of the platform that they are running Atom upon.\n## Challenges\n\nThere are some pitfalls I've identified with this approach. I don't think that they are significant enough to prevent going ahead with this, but they should be kept in mind and solutions should be identified and implemented over time.\n### How Granular Should Behavior Services Be?\n\nIn the example of the closing the last open file or last window mentioned in the introduction, there are actually a few tightly-related behaviors:\n1. Does closing the last tab close the window?\n2. Does closing the last window exit the application?\n3. Does closing the last tab in a pane destroy the pane?\n4. Does using the standard close command close the window if there is no file open?\n\nShould this be one service? Or four? Or somewhere in between? Because of the way the service hub system works, there can be only one loaded and activated provider.\n### Discoverability\n\nLet's say I have installed a package that overrides the tab/pane/window close behavior. How do we indicate to the user that to configure this behavior they no longer use the built-in configuration options, but have to go to the `super-special-close-behavior` package settings to configure it?\n### Supportability\n\nWhen someone has an issue with how Atom is behaving, how can we easily find out that they have the `super-broken-close-behavior` package installed and enabled?\n\n/cc @atom/feedback \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9820/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9819","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9819/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9819/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9819/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9819","id":118853415,"number":9819,"title":"Proposal: Block Decorations","user":{"login":"as-cii","id":482957,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/482957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii","html_url":"https://github.com/as-cii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":118249520,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/api","name":"api","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":274751644,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/proposal","name":"proposal","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2015-11-25T14:55:43Z","updated_at":"2016-02-03T20:46:58Z","closed_at":"2016-01-14T20:20:00Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"The aim of this document is to write down some of the ideas @nathansobo and I discussed over the past days. I don't think we should implement everything herein proposed in one single, big step. Still, I feel like it's valuable to have a place to discuss the API and to share these ideas with the :globe_with_meridians:.\n\nAs of today, Atom doesn't provide a way to create decorations that affect screen rows layout. More specifically, we think it would be :cool: to expose an API that allows users to create something like the following:\n\n![block-decorations](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/11395769/301ee8cc-936d-11e5-9323-1b376d39f1e9.jpg)\n\nYou can notice how lines of text break when a block decoration begins and how they resume later when the decoration ends. This hypothethical abstraction would cover several scenarios for package authors, among which:\n- Show diffs;\n- Show previews;\n- And, more generally, provide a richer experience within the editor;\n\nThis primitive would cover only decorations in between screen rows; that is, users won't be able to insert inline elements between `<span>`s inside a screen row by using a block decoration.\n## API\n\nThe code for using this API could look like the following:\n\n``` js\nlet div = document.createElement(\"div\")\nlet marker = editor.markScreenPosition([7, 0], {invalidate: \"never\"}) // is \"never\" the right invalidation strategy?\nlet decoration = editor.decorateMarker(marker, {type: \"block\", item: div})\n```\n\nI am also thinking to provide a shorthand for the above code:\n\n``` js\neditor.addBlockDecorationBeforeScreenRow(7, document.createElement(\"div\"))\n```\n\nBut I guess I'd like to see how this gets used before dealing with this kind of extra details, although I prefer the latter version more in terms of readability. :book:\n\nAlso, I feel like we might take this a bit further by enforcing a better separation of concerns between the model and the view, by avoiding to pass an element as the `item` when decorating the marker and using the `ViewRegistry` instead. This seems to stray from how we implemented other decoration APIs, so take this thought with a grain of salt.\n### Performance\n\nWe would need to know the whole content height in advance in order to show the appropriate vertical scrollbar. Right now, we measure a dummy line's height and calculate `dummyLineHeight * model.getScreenLineCount()`; if we introduced this kind of custom content, however, we'd need to measure block decorations upfront and then calculate height like: `dummyLineHeight * model.getScreenLineCount() + measuredBlockDecorationsHeight`. When having lots of these, loading/refreshing them could become problematic.\n\nOn the core side, the scrollbar problem _seems_ the only issue preventing block decorations to be fetched, rendered and measured incrementally (as we do for other decorations); we might even argue that people are used to this sort of progressive content loading on the web, thus making this a non-problem but I'd :heart: to have some more feedback on this. For example, what about minimap? I would think that it will need to know block decorations' height in advance rather than as the user scrolls.\n\nAnother optimization tactic we could employ is to split up the measurement tasks in chunks to be executed across multiple animation frames.\n\nTo tell the truth, I believe we should just go for the \"measure everything upfront\" approach first, see how that feels and then re-iterate on that later (if needed). :racehorse: \n### Styling\n\nBecause of Shadow DOM, we will have to insert elements outside the shadow root and find a way to teleport them in the right spot inside the editor content. The most straightforward way of doing this could be the following:\n\n``` html\n<atom-text-editor>\n  <#shadow-root>\n    <div class='tile-1'>\n      <content select=\".block-decoration-before-screen-row-1\"></content>\n      <div data-screen-row='1'></div>\n      <div data-screen-row='2'></div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='tile-2'>\n      <div data-screen-row='3'></div>\n      <content select=\".block-decoration-before-screen-row-4\"></content>\n      <div data-screen-row='4'></div>\n    </div>\n  </#shadow-root>\n\n  <div class='block-decoration-before-screen-row-1'></div>\n  <div class='block-decoration-before-screen-row-1'></div>\n  <div class='block-decoration-before-screen-row-4'></div>\n</atom-text-editor>\n```\n### UX\n\nWhen a block decoration above the current scroll area changes its height, we need to make sure to adjust the current scroll position seamlessly, so that the editor doesn't scroll down when the user is, for example, editing something.\n\n**Question:** What about the gutter? Should we have block decorations in there as well?\n### Naming\n\nShould we consider other names for this API? \"Block decoration\" seems a pretty sensible choice to me, as it seems to reflect CSS' semantics for elements with a `display: block` style. What do you think? :bulb:\n\nFeedback is super welcome! :sparkles: :bow:\n\n/cc: @nathansobo @maxbrunsfeld @atom/feedback\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9818","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9818/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9818/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9818/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9818","id":118851739,"number":9818,"title":"Github Markdown renderer is different to actual Github output","user":{"login":"axic","id":20340,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/axic","html_url":"https://github.com/axic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-11-25T14:47:02Z","updated_at":"2015-11-25T16:45:06Z","closed_at":"2015-11-25T16:45:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The below sample markdown renders the numbers without restarting in Atom, while on Github (here) the third point will restart from 1.

#9548.\n\nBefore this PR, we were using `addEventListener` to listen for commands on elements with the `.native-key-bindings` class. The only way a command (i.e. not a standard event) can be triggered on an HTML element, however, is through `atom-keymap`, but that doesn't happen whenever a native keymap is fully matched.\n\nIn the old jQuery days, whenever adding an event listener on the document, we also called `atom.commands.add`, thus allowing to listen on the document and still being notified for events dispatched manually from `CommandRegistry`. After dropping it, though, we didn't update the `handleNativeKeybindings` code path to use `CommandRegistry`, thus not hitting that code path anymore when e.g. copy-pasting because those kinds of event are _synthesized_ (and not triggered on the DOM) whenever a command from `ApplicationMenu` or `ContextMenu` is dispatched.\n\nIt would be awesome if anyone could verify that the above rationale is sound, 'cause I'm relatively new to this area of the codebase. :smile_cat: \n\n/cc: @nathansobo @atom/feedback

([screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/s5af0ea.jpg)).\n\nThe problem is that `linter-eslint` package version today appeared as \"undefined\" in Settings|Packages.\n(Unfortunately I didn't keep a screenshot of that)\nI noticed that because the package was not working, though it was enabled.\n\nDisabling and re-enabling it didn't fix it. \nWhat only fixed it (i.e. made the package work, and display it's version number instead of \"undefined\") was uninstalling+re-installing the package.\nBut, this works only until the next Atom update_(I think that it occurred after updating Atom from beta 5 to beta 6)_\n\nThis is the 2nd time this occurs the last days (both cases were after an Atom update I think) and in both cases I had to uninstall and re-install it.\n\nI didn't find any relevant entry in
