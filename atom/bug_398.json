You can set `some.setting` 10 times with similar scopes creating a chain of properties that need to be evaluated against a scoped descriptor. Which one of those set is the default? The path through those scoped properties depends on ordering and specificity when matched against a scopeDescriptor.\n\nDefaults here rely on some simplifications based on our use of scoped settings.\n1. Every value set in the property store has a `source` property indicating where it came from. Each scoped setting set via the user config file or `Config::set`, has this `source` property set to `user-config`. Scoped defaults can be any scoped property who's `source` property is not `user-config`. So anything set by a package's `scoped-properties.cson` is a default, and anything the user sets is an override.\n2. The settings view needs to check and reset the default values with the same scope selector used to initially set the properties. Currently these selectors are language scopes: `'.source.js'`, etc. eg. The way it's written in this PR, we cannot reset the default for the scope descriptor `['.source.js', '.meta.function.name']`, but we can for `['.source.js']` because `'.source.js'` is the way it went in.\n\nFor reason number 2, all the methods; `isDefault`, `getDefault`, `restoreDefault`, `getSettings`; take a `scopeSelector`, not a `scopeDescriptor`.\n\nDepends on

is a step toward updating the text editor to use the shadow DOM (#3677).\n\nPreviously our style sheets were managed globally, but with the introduction of the shadow DOM we now need to be able to load stylesheets into specific contexts and not others. The theme manager was previously mutating the DOM directly when stylesheets were applied, which clashed with our requirement of loading specific stylesheets in specific contexts. This PR now introduces a new custom element `<atom-styles>`, which interacts with the style manager at `atom.styles` to render the stylesheets in our head.\n\nThe next step will introduce targeting stylesheets to specific contexts. When an `<atom-styles>` element is appended to a shadow root, it will only add child style elements that are targeted for that shadow root. If stylesheets are targeted with a specific context, they won't be loaded in the document's head.\n\nCurrently, the new style manager only focuses on _applying_ stylesheets. Loading is still handled in the theme manager. It should probably be moved so the theme manager only deals with themes, not stylesheet loading and compilation.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3829","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3829/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3829/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3829/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3829","id":45785362,"number":3829,"title":"Atom:

using the Atom for Windows Alpha from the Atom website (not Chocolatey), version 0.136.0 (as viewed in the Help menu and with `--version` in the command line, the `version` file in the Atom folder says v0.17.1; it was downloaded around 12:30AM US Eastern on October 14, 2014 if that helps) on Windows 8.1. I set `text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;` for `.editor` in `styles.less` (because otherwise the ligatures aren't in effect and I get each individual character). This happens regardless of whether hardware acceleration is enabled. It also happens in `--safe` mode, and the developer tools console shows no errors.\n\n![temp](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4254261/4624455/bad18f5a-5364-11e4-9a0f-8c59596bcd59.png)\n\n```\n(<*>)::Functor f=>(a->b)->(f a->f b)\nfmap::Functor f=>(a->b)->(f a->f b)\n```\n\nin [Hasklig](https://github.com/i-tu/Hasklig), which has ligatures for `<*>`, `::`, `=>`, and `->`.\n\n![temp](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4254261/4624502/6b794cee-5365-11e4-8d85-a129dee8ae1d.png)\n\n```\nfifififififififififi\n```\n\nin Calibri, using the ligature for `fi`. The cursor is at the end of the line, and the misspell underline only leads up to that point as well. The ligature for `ff` in Calibri has the opposite effect; the cursor and underline extend farther than text on the screen if you put enough f's on a line.\n\nI can provide more details if you need them.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3821/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3820","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3820/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3820/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3820/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3820","id":45707092,"number":3820,"title":"sometimes, every command is executed twice. reopening the file fixes it","user":{"login":"jonathanong","id":643505,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/643505?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanong","html_url":"https://github.com/jonathanong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-10-14T02:51:44Z","updated_at":"2014-10-14T17:03:06Z","closed_at":"2014-10-14T16:48:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"ex. one space click will become 2, a \"arrow left\" key will actually go up 2 levels\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3820/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4754","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"8365:2B9B:786390:F54597:59D92CD8","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=399>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=397>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"a43db5d94928bf16fb8f684706868572\"","status":"200 OK"}}
