Before changing it the cost of this function was `O(n^2)`: selections were accessed always and in sparse order, causing the traversing time to increase exponentially as more and more selections were added. \n\nBefore merging selections, we now order them first and try to intersect the current selection with the previous one only. This brings the cost of `mergeIntersectingSelections` down to `O(n log n)`, changing this:\n\n![screen shot 2015-02-22 at 14 01 32](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/6318610/5c48188e-ba9b-11e4-9470-5ce9becff76f.png)\n\nTo this:\n\n![screen shot 2015-02-22 at 14 00 31](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/6318618/b80862aa-ba9b-11e4-9ea7-eafbf7fe32e1.png)\n\n:racehorse: :racehorse: :racehorse: \n\n_(Benchmarks based on splitting into lines the entire selection of a 400 lines file)_\n\nAll the specs are green, therefore this \"new algorithm\" shouldn't have changed the behavior of `mergeIntersectingSelections`.

is a proposal for fixing #5642 and I'd welcome feedback on if this is the right approach or not?\n\nThe problem, is copying pasting PHPDoc code at an indented level, with hard tabs on, loses the asterisk alignment:\n\n![example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/939815/6273202/41e81dbe-b865-11e4-8ea5-a5354bdbb50c.gif)\n\n**Root Cause**\n\nSeems inside Atom, in the case of encountering soft tabs in a hard tab file... it can return a _floating point_ indentation level, such as 1.5 in this instance (tab+half-tab). When rebuilding the indentation (it calls setIndentationForBufferRow for each line), this calls @buildIndentString with 1.5 which gets converted to integer: 1. ALL leading whitespace is then replaced by this new indentation - so we lose the space that aligns the asterisk.\n\nThe tests seem to point to floating point indentation levels being allowed. Yet I can find nowhere where it is useful. Most places just Math.ceil(). And with hard tabs it doesn't even make sense.\n\nThis patch attempts to remove all the floating points (it leaves the Math.ceil calls - they're harmless and can be cleaned later if this turns out the right approach.). It then has a function for \"modifying\" whitespace to change its indentation level, while paying attention to straggling spacing like that in the PHPDoc comments in the image above. It also adds a couple API for handling indentation changes that can be used elsewhere.\n\nOnly thing I'm not too happy with is the overlap between my \"setIndentLevelForRow\" and the existing \"setIndentationForBufferRow\" - I'm sure mine follows correct naming convention but existing doesn't. It is the existing one that is called when pasting though.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5658/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5657","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5657/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5657/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5657/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5657","id":58407121,"number":5657,"title":"Different character widths in OS X and Linux","user":{"login":"jeremy-engel","id":4955347,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4955347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremy-engel","html_url":"https://github.com/jeremy-engel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremy-engel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremy-engel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremy-engel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremy-engel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremy-engel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremy-engel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremy-engel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremy-engel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremy-engel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":84710475,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/editor-rendering","name":"editor-rendering","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":97577987,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/linux","name":"linux","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2015-02-20T20:37:34Z","updated_at":"2017-06-09T01:42:21Z","closed_at":"2017-06-09T01:42:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Using Atom 0.182.0 in OS X and Mint 16 produces different results for the same file. In the screenshots below, the top figure is on the linux version and the bottom is in OS X. The width of the non-breaking hyphen (‑) differs, as you can see from the alignment towards the end of that row.\n\n![screenshot from 2015-02-20 12 27 28](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4955347/6308803/3b65c382-b8fc-11e4-9a95-e0386dae09a7.png)\n\n![screen shot 2015-02-20 at 12 27 19 pmaaaaa](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4955347/6308909/1e97ce48-b8fd-11e4-9e70-f61303a3ec65.png)\n\nThe font for both of these is Source Code Pro. The bottom figure is clearly the desired behavior.\n\nI am pretty sure the linux behavior, where this character is more narrow than all others, was present in the OS X version until recently, but I just noticed that it changed today.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5657/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5656","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5656/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5656/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5656/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5656","id":58405203,"number":5656,"title":"File autoload and append a newline when disabling whitespace.ensureSingleTrailingNewline","user":{"login":"fundon","id":27926,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/27926?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fundon","html_url":"https://github.com/fundon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fundon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fundon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fundon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fundon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fundon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fundon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fundon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fundon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fundon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-02-20T20:20:02Z","updated_at":"2015-02-20T20:58:11Z","closed_at":"2015-02-20T20:58:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The `whitespace.ensureSingleTrailingNewline` was disabled.\nBut it still appends a newline.\n\nMy steps:\n1. open `package.json` in Atom\n2. exec command `$ npm i xx@latest --save` in Terminal\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4815","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"CD74:366E:707839:ECF5F7:59D92C03","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=338>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=336>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"c09a8172bfd2589abd0baec3b987de0f\"","status":"200 OK"}}
