We see this pretty regularly in Nuclide, where a Nuclide feature stops working because a user has installed a buggy third party package. Recently a user had a buggy package installed which threw on TextBuffer will-save preventing the user from saving their file which was particularly frustrating.\n\nI think Atom should catch all exceptions thrown by installed packages, while still reporting the exception in some way. This should give a good balance between robustness and debugability.\n\nI have a pull request coming (https://github.com/peterhal/event-kit/commit/83ac63055b76d5ec74e551dfea7ebb5e09e62b82) for event kit emit which should make this proposal concrete.

recently run into a weird issue with `TextEditor::backwardsScanInBufferRange` (see https://github.com/fcrespo82/atom-markdown-table-formatter/issues/23)\n\nConsider this snippet:\n\n``` javascript\natom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor().backwardsScanInBufferRange(/./g, atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor().getBuffer().getRange(), function(m) { console.log(m); m.replace(m.matchText+m.matchText); });\n```\n\nThis should, as far as I can gather, duplicate every character in current editor's buffer.\n\nOn a buffer with empty first line, it evidently does, i.e. buffer text like this\n\n```\n\nabcdefg\nhijklmn\nopqrstu\nvwzyz\n```\n\nbecomes\n\n```\n\naabbccddeeffgg\nhhiijjkkllmmnn\nooppqqrrssttuu\nvvwwzzyyzz\n```\n\nNote empty first line.\nThis is expected.\n\nWhat is unexpected is if we take the same buffer without empty first line, e.g.\n\n```\nabcdefg\nhijklmn\nopqrstu\nvwzyz\n```\n\nthen it becomes\n\n```\naabbccddeeffggdhhiijjkkllmmnnhooppqqrrssttuulvvwwzzyyzz\nooppqqrrssttuu\nvvwwzzyyzz\n```\n\nNote how it gobbled up newlines and introduced duplication.\n\nYou can use code snippet mentioned above in dev.console to test this.\n\nThis is really strange. Hope that someone can shed some light on this behavior.\nLooks like a bug if you ask me.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10075/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10074","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10074/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10074/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10074/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10074","id":122310344,"number":10074,"title":"Editor crashes consistently with particular string","user":{"login":"suzanne-stathatos","id":6374252,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6374252?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suzanne-stathatos","html_url":"https://github.com/suzanne-stathatos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suzanne-stathatos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suzanne-stathatos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suzanne-stathatos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suzanne-stathatos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suzanne-stathatos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suzanne-stathatos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suzanne-stathatos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suzanne-stathatos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suzanne-stathatos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":153145129,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/crash","name":"crash","color":"e11d21","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-12-15T16:25:19Z","updated_at":"2015-12-15T17:05:21Z","closed_at":"2015-12-15T17:05:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The editor crashes when I hit the \"r\" in \"n = nums.search....\" \n\nI did this 4 times.

Not really sure how to describe the issue, so I report the exact steps to reproduce it.\n\n**Reproduction steps**\n1 - open Atom\n2 - create three new untitled buffers and modify them so they're marked as unsaved\n3 - split the third buffer right (it will create a new pane)\n4 - drag the second buffer in the second pane, then split it down (another pane is created)\n5 - close the first buffer without saving it\n6 - split right the two remaining buffer, or just one of them\n\n**Expected behaviour**\nWhen splitting the remaining buffers, new panes should be created, containing a copy of the split buffer.\n\n**Observed behaviour**\nWhen splitting the remaining buffers, nothing happens. In the dev console is possible to see that the text editors in the workspace are created.\n- I tried to split both tabs, then I closed them. In this case, the two panes stay alive, while the split buffers are not shown (gif 1).\n- If I split just one of the two remaining tabs and then close both of them, all the split buffers are shown all at the same time (gif 2).\n\n**Screenshots and gifs**\nFirst case: both tabs are split.\n![untitled](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/472900/11815101/1a750742-a342-11e5-91d7-30eb5d095f0c.gif)\n\nSecond case: only one tab is split.\n![untitled2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/472900/11815102/1a785a8c-a342-11e5-8570-eb742fbd08b0.gif)\n\n**Atom version**: 1.3.1\n**Environment**: OS X El Capitan 10.11.1 and Windows 10\n\n**Additional information**\n- Problem can be reproduced in safe mode: yes\n- Problem started happening recently, didn't happen in an older version of Atom: no\n- Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: yes\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10073/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10072","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10072/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10072/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10072/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10072","id":122220832,"number":10072,"title":"Instructions on how to make Atom portable","user":{"login":"Zireael07","id":4525388,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4525388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zireael07","html_url":"https://github.com/Zireael07","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zireael07/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zireael07/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zireael07/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zireael07/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zireael07/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zireael07/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zireael07/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zireael07/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zireael07/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":104428530,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":62363277,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"damieng","id":118951,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/118951?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng","html_url":"https://github.com/damieng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"assignees":[{"login":"damieng","id":118951,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/118951?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng","html_url":"https://github.com/damieng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true}],"milestone":null,"comments":44,"created_at":"2015-12-15T08:42:33Z","updated_at":"2016-10-30T19:50:08Z","closed_at":"2016-03-10T19:25:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have Atom 1.3.1.

This is because the width of the tab is held constant until the mouse leaves the tab area, so if I close a tab, the next tab moves to occupy the exact same space that the previous tab did, with the \"x\" in the same position, allowing me to quickly close a large number of tabs by simply clicking repeatedly in the same spot.\n\nI've noticed while using Atom that I oftentimes want to quickly close a large number of tabs, which proves to be challenging given the current state of tab closing. Below are two options for how this could be improved.\n\n**Option 1 (easier)**\n\nMove the \"x\" to the same side tabs are floated. For me, tabs are floated left (this may be different for right-to-left languages, I don't know). For me, if the \"x\" was also on the left, then you could rapidly close tabs by clicking repeatedly in the same position, since the \"x\" of the next tab would occupy the same position as the \"x\" of the tab that was just closed. This seems like the obvious solution to me, but there may be other reasons that the \"x\" was placed on the right-hand side that I'm not aware of.\n\n**Option 2 (more difficult)**\n\nLeave the \"x\" where it is (on the right-hand side), but use Chrome's approach of keeping the tab size constant until the user moves the mouse out of the tab region. This would require a lot more code, but would allow you to keep the \"x\" on the right-hand side (if that is important for some reason).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10062","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10062/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10062/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10062/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10062","id":122167764,"number":10062,"title":"Emit state update when model's scroll position is changed","user":{"login":"maxbrunsfeld","id":326587,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/326587?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld","html_url":"https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-12-15T00:59:14Z","updated_at":"2015-12-15T01:38:38Z","closed_at":"2015-12-15T01:38:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/10062","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10062","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10062.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10062.patch"},"body":"Previously, manipulating the model's scroll position would not emit a presenter state update.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10062/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4961","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"C189:366E:6FD245:EBAAEE:59D929FD","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=192>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=190>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"199315bb197fdf785c0d56af6a2a1ba2\"","status":"200 OK"}}
