I didn't include a `firstLineMatch` for the Sourcepawn package because there's really no telling what someone will decide to put for the first line (they could immediately start with the code, or maybe a comment, or maybe a preprocessor...).  Since neither PHP nor Sourcepawn can definitively claim the file as its own, it seems like PHP then takes precedence simply because it comes before Sourcepawn in the alphabet (I haven't tested this, but it seems pretty plausible).\n\nSo, is there any way that the auto-detection of grammar could be improved by, say, looking at the regex in each language and seeing which one lines up better?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4632","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4632/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4632/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4632/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/4632","id":52064072,"number":4632,"title":"Add atom.sh and apm.sh Windows scripts","user":{"login":"kevinsawicki","id":671378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/671378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinsawicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-12-16T01:51:41Z","updated_at":"2014-12-16T18:29:23Z","closed_at":"2014-12-16T18:00:25Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/4632","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/4632","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/4632.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/4632.patch"},"body":"For use in Windows shells that are bash-like.\n\nCloses #4586\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4632/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4631","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4631/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4631/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4631/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/4631","id":52063505,"number":4631,"title":"New config API","user":{"login":"maxbrunsfeld","id":326587,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/326587?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld","html_url":"https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-12-16T01:43:06Z","updated_at":"2014-12-18T19:12:22Z","closed_at":"2014-12-16T23:22:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/4631","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/4631","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/4631.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/4631.patch"},"body":"This PR updates the config API, but does not change the way global properties are stored.
