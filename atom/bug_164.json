All I wish to say is that in my experience the problem is not fixed.  So it should be re-opened.\n### Description\n\nOn Windows 10, I uninstalled Atom, downloaded the latest version from https://atom.io/, and installed it (Atom 1.5.3), expecting that its installer would bring the new functionality to my PC.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nI went to a code file, right-clicked on it, and went to the \"Open With...\" submenu. Atom was not in the mini list. Clicked \"Choose another App\".  \n\nSadly, there is no Atom-with-nice-green-icon in the list.  Options are:\n- Keep using this app: atom.cmd (blank white icon; old, undesirable method of accessing Atom)\n- Other options: Sublime, Vim, etc\n- More apps (with down-arrow).\n\nClicking More apps brings up a bigger list of editors, and various unrelated applications.  Atom is not there.  Finally there is \"Look for another app on this PC\", which brings up the file explorer.\n\nAnd so nothing has changed.\n### Desired Behavior\n\nRight click, Open With, \"Choose Another App\", check \"Always use this app to open .xyz files\", choose Atom-with-nice-green-icon which should be there, and it becomes the default editor. All .xyz files immediately receive the Atom file icon to show that they will be opened by Atom in future.\n### Versions\n\natom version 1.5.3\napm version 1.6.0\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10913/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10912","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10912/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10912/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10912/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10912","id":135016016,"number":10912,"title":"Atom.exe command-line output cannot be redirected to a file/pipe","user":{"login":"FeodorFitsner","id":5041459,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5041459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeodorFitsner","html_url":"https://github.com/FeodorFitsner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeodorFitsner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeodorFitsner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeodorFitsner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeodorFitsner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeodorFitsner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeodorFitsner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeodorFitsner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeodorFitsner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FeodorFitsner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"joefitzgerald","id":744740,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/744740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joefitzgerald","html_url":"https://github.com/joefitzgerald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joefitzgerald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joefitzgerald/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joefitzgerald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joefitzgerald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joefitzgerald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joefitzgerald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joefitzgerald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joefitzgerald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joefitzgerald/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"joefitzgerald","id":744740,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/744740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joefitzgerald","html_url":"https://github.com/joefitzgerald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joefitzgerald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joefitzgerald/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joefitzgerald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joefitzgerald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joefitzgerald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joefitzgerald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joefitzgerald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joefitzgerald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joefitzgerald/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-02-20T01:20:48Z","updated_at":"2016-02-22T23:50:03Z","closed_at":"2016-02-22T23:47:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\n\nOn Windows atom.exe command-line does not respect redirecting output to a file (or pipe).\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.

a fontsize of more than `100%` for a certain css scope, such as `.heading-1` results in several rendering issues:\n- Displaced lines, resulting in overlaps.\n- gutters and cursor height does not match the actual line size / font height\n- Bigger fontsized lines don't _soft wrap_ properly\n\nThis is no new issue and it's possibly difficult to prevent, as a lot depends on measuring lines heights etc. and having different sized characters certainly won't make it easier.\nSome issues, such as a displaced cursor have been fixed previously eg. via https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8811, but the above

Thank you in advance.\n\n```\n2016-02-18 19:06:59> Program: Starting Squirrel Updater: --install .\n2016-02-18 19:06:59> Program: Starting install, writing to C:\\Users\\[name]\\AppData\\Local\\SquirrelTemp\n2016-02-18 19:06:59> Program: About to install to: C:\\Users\\[name]\\AppData\\Local\\atom\n2016-02-18 19:06:59> CheckForUpdateImpl: Failed to load local releases, starting from scratch: System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException: Could not find a part of the path 'C:\\Users\\[name]\\AppData\\Local\\atom\\packages\\RELEASES'.\n   at System.IO.__Error.WinIOError(Int32 errorCode, String maybeFullPath)\n   at System.IO.FileStream.Init(String path, FileMode mode, FileAccess access, Int32 rights, Boolean useRights, FileShare share, Int32 bufferSize, FileOptions options, SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES secAttrs, String msgPath, Boolean bFromProxy, Boolean useLongPath, Boolean checkHost)\n   at System.IO.FileStream..ctor(String path, FileMode mode, FileAccess access, FileShare share)\n   at Squirrel.Utility.LoadLocalReleases(String localReleaseFile)\n   at Squirrel.UpdateManager.CheckForUpdateImpl.<CheckForUpdate>d__3d.MoveNext()\n2016-02-18 19:06:59> CheckForUpdateImpl: Reading RELEASES file from C:\\Users\\[name]\\AppData\\Local\\SquirrelTemp\n2016-02-18 19:06:59> CheckForUpdateImpl: First run or local directory is corrupt, starting from scratch\n2016-02-18 19:06:59> ApplyReleasesImpl: Writing files to app directory: C:\\Users\\[name]\\AppData\\Local\\atom\\app-1.5.3\n2016-02-18 19:07:17> IEnableLogger: Failed to install package to app dir: System.IO.PathTooLongException: The specified path, file name, or both are too long.
