structured cloning to `JSON.stringify` when we had to serialize state. Even though that was faster, it led to several issues like stringifying cyclic structures and taking more and more time as the `History` grew over time.\n\nWith this PR we still continuously save the `AtomEnvironment`'s state, but we try to address the above concerns by: \n1. Incrementally converting history changes to a binary format. (https://github.com/atom/atom-patch/pull/7)\n2. Serialize marker snapshots only before quitting. Although this won't maintain selection after hard crashes, the user history will always be preserved.\n\nThe result is the following: \n\n![screen shot 2016-03-04 at 17 43 44](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/13533433/b67d40dc-e230-11e5-9789-7a1e993cba9a.png)\n![screen shot 2016-03-04 at 17 44 03](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/13533434/b6b32d3c-e230-11e5-8252-90958f4de929.png)\n\n(**Total:** `~ 40ms`, benchmarks performed by simultaneously writing 5 characters on 1500 lines)\n\nThose `~ 34ms` will only be payed the first time new history entries need to be serialized, because we will reuse a cached binary representation of them whenever they need to be serialized again.\n\nAs a byproduct, and thanks to history's internals restructuring, undos/redos with many overlapping changes will get faster, as we compose and merge them without repeating some of the work for the intersecting regions.\n\nIt would be awesome to have some feedback on this, especially to understand how this feels to you performance-wise after a test-drive.\n\nWhat's missing:\n- [x] Bump text-buffer after merging the related PR.\n\n/cc: @atom/core \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11060/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11059","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11059/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11059/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11059/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11059","id":138506191,"number":11059,"title":"Markdown code snippets: incorrect syntax highlighting","user":{"login":"abedef","id":6138405,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6138405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abedef","html_url":"https://github.com/abedef","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abedef/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abedef/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abedef/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abedef/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abedef/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abedef/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abedef/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abedef/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abedef/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-03-04T15:44:14Z","updated_at":"2016-03-04T15:47:39Z","closed_at":"2016-03-04T15:47:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\n\nWhen writing code snippets in Markdown using syntax highlighting of certain languages (in my case, Objective-C), entering an asterisk character causes the rest of the text in the editor window to appear italicized.\n\n[Here](http://i.imgur.com/pQ0eiXh.png) is a screenshot showing the effect of this bug.\n\n[Here](http://i.imgur.com/TXIdJHI.png) is a screenshot showing the same Markdown file's preview. Notice that the text following the code snippet is not italicized.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nWrite a Markdown code snippet in Objective-C. For example:\n\n``` objective-c\n- (void)viewDidLoad\n{\n    [super viewDidLoad];\n    SKView *spriteView = (SKView *) self.view;\n    spriteView.showsDrawCount = YES;\n    spriteView.showsNodeCount = YES;\n    spriteView.showsFPS = YES;\n}\n\n// In the editor window, this text will appear to be italicized.\n```\n\nIn the editor window, you will see that the first asterisk in the line `SKView *spriteView = (SKView *) self.view;` causes the rest of the code to appear as if it were being italicized (it is not).\n\n**Expected behavior:** the asterisk within the code snippet is treated as a part of the code and ignored as a Markdown formatting character.\n\n**Actual behavior:** the asterisk within the code snippet is treated as a Markdown formatting character and, as a result, the following text is highlighted to signify that it is being italicized (it is not).\n### Versions\n\natom version 1.5.4\napm version 1.6.0\nrunning on OS X 10.11.3\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11059/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11058","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11058/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11058/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11058/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11058","id":138504453,"number":11058,"title":"PHP syntax highlighting is broken when using \"long comment type\" within PHP-Tags","user":{"login":"Terail","id":12572023,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/12572023?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Terail","html_url":"https://github.com/Terail","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Terail/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Terail/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Terail/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Terail/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Terail/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Terail/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Terail/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Terail/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Terail/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-03-04T15:36:02Z","updated_at":"2016-03-04T15:40:26Z","closed_at":"2016-03-04T15:40:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\n\nHaving a PHP code like below, does Atom let everything after the closing <?php */ ?> still interpret as \"comment type\" until the end of the file.

Currently uses `.checkbox[type=\"checkbox\"]`, which means you need to use an `<input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"checkbox\">` to get the styling. Alternatives:\n   1. `input[type=\"checkbox\"]`: Then the class is not needed, but it would make it harder to use a custom checkbox. One day we might wanna add a \"toggle switch\" that also uses `<input type=\"checkbox\">`.\n   2. `.checkbox`: Some packages might already use that name in other ways (e.g. settings-view uses it as the wrapper for a checkbox). So a little more risky.\n2. **Color**? Currently uses `@background-color-success`. Which is green in most themes. Alternative:\n   1. Use `@background-color-info` which is blue in most themes. Would follow OS X default convention, but feel a bit uncanny if you have it set to OS X's grey theme.\n## Todo\n- [x] Add checkbox styles\n- [x] Add `indeterminate` state\n## Todo after merge\n- Use in `settings-view`\n- Use in `about`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11039/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11038","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11038/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11038/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11038/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11038","id":138039873,"number":11038,"title":"Uncaught

Prerequisites\n- [x] ~~Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](https://atom.io/docs/latest/hacking-atom-debugging#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode)?~~\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](https://atom.io/docs/latest/hacking-atom-debugging#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] ~~Did you check the [debugging guide](https://atom.io/docs/latest/hacking-atom-debugging)?~~\n- [x] ~~Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?~~\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nThere are some issues with the way the user's environment is made available within Atom:\n- On OS X, if a user launches `Atom.app` from `Finder`, `Spotlight`, `Dock`, `open`, or another `launchd` launched process, the user's environment is anaemic and potentially varies from the user's intended environment\n- If a user launches `atom` from the command line multiple times, any changes in the environment for attempts `2...n` are not reflected in Atom's environment\n\nI am conflating these two issues because I propose they should be solved by adding a ~~project-level API to `atom.project` (e.g. `atom.project.getEnv()` or `atom.project.env`)~~ functionality to Atom that:\n- Is aware of the OS X \"anaemic environment\" issue and is capable of patching the environment for the implicit project that exists on first launch of Atom, if Atom was indeed launched from `Finder`, `Dock`, `Spotlight`, `open`, et a\n- Allows projects to have a varying environment, so that multiple invocations of `atom` from the command line can result in some change in the environment, if changes were made\n\n~~Note that this specifically does _not_ endorse changing `process.env` nor does it seek to patch it. The actual environment for the running Atom process should be preserved, unpatched as it is still a valid environment for the original process. This also allows existing functionality to work as it always has, while providing a mechanism for package authors to opt-in to the new project-level API.~~\n### Open Questions\n- Is `atom.project` the right place for this?\n- ~~What \"marker\" can be used to determine - on OS X - that the environment should be patched (see https://github.com/atom-community/environment/blob/3ccde732f213452e9b897482e1a3fba1f7a4a3e2/lib/environment.js#L113-L120 for prior art)~~ We are going to use the presence of ~~`TERM`~~ `PWD` as a marker on OSX that the environment does not need to be patched\n- ~~Should `atom.project.getEnv()` return a promise to permit the patching, or should any patching be done synchronously (e.g. `atom.project.env`)?~~ process.env will be patched directly.\n- ~~Should there be lifecycle events that are associated with changes in a project's environment (e.g. `onWillChangeEnv`, `onDidChangeEnv`, etc.)?~~ No.\n- I'm certain there are a bunch of issues that this proposal would solve; I'd love help from @50Wliu and @lee-dohm to find them all\n### Prior Art\n- https;//atom.io/packages/environment\n- https://www.npmjs.com/package/consistent-env\n## The Anaemic OS X Environment Issue\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Use OS X\n2. Launch Atom from `Finder`, `Spotlight`, `Dock`, `open`\n3. Open the Atom console, and type `process.env`\n4. Observe the environment is anaemic\n5. Quit Atom\n6. Launch Atom from the terminal (`atom .`)\n7. Open the Atom console, and type `process.env`\n8. Observe the environment is as you would expect\n\n**Expected behavior:** The environment is the same, regardless of how Atom is launched on OS X.\n\n<img width=\"572\" alt=\"untitled 2\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/744740/13480739/90a16e42-e0a5-11e5-8efc-5e6dded6ae44.png\">\n\n**Actual behavior:** The environment is different, depending on how Atom is launched.\n\n<img width=\"572\" alt=\"untitled\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/744740/13480724/7f9a0b2c-e0a5-11e5-975e-a564ce93b492.png\">\n### Versions\n\nAll, <= 1.7.x.\n## The Multiple-Launch Issue\n### Steps to Reproduce\n- Atom does not update its environment when a project is opened twice\n  1. Use any operating system\n  2. Launch a terminal\n  3. Make a directory (e.g. `directory-1`), and change your working directory to it\n  4. Set an environment variable called `SOMEVAR` to `true` (e.g. `export SOMEVAR=true` on OS X / Linux; `SET SOMEVAR=true` on Windows)\n  5. Launch `atom` from the terminal (e.g. `atom .`)\n  6. Observe a new Window launches, with a new project in the tree view, for the `directory-1` directory\n  7. Open the Atom console, and type `process.env`\n  8. Observe the environment has the `SOMEVAR` key set with a value of `true`\n  9. Go back to the terminal, and set the SOMEVAR environment variable to `false` (e.g. `export SOMEVAR=true` on OS X / Linux; `SET SOMEVAR=true` on Windows)\n  10. Launch Atom from the terminal (`atom .`)\n  11. Observe a new process launches temporarily, but then exits, and the original atom window focuses, with the `directory-1` project open\n  12. Open the Atom console, and type `process.env`\n  13. Observe the environment has the `SOMEVAR` key set with a value of `true` (although one would expect it to have a value of `false` now)\n      <img width=\"703\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-03-02 at 5 58 47 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/744740/13480030/b3b15c8a-e0a0-11e5-83ec-d6e86b771785.png\">\n- Atom does not allow different environments for different projects / windows\n  1. (Continued from above)\n  2. Change your working directory to the parent folder of `directory-1`\n  3. Make a directory (e.g. `directory-2`) and change your working directory to it \n  4. Set an environment variable called `SOMEOTHERVAR` to `true` (e.g. `export SOMEOTHERVAR=true` on OS X / Linux; `SET SOMEOTHERVAR=true` on Windows)\n  5. Launch `atom` from the terminal (e.g. `atom .`)\n  6. Observe a new Window launches, with a new project in the tree view, for the `directory-2` directory\n  7. Observe that the existing Window for `directory-1` is still open\n  8. Open the Atom console, and type `process.env`\n  9. Observe the environment has the `SOMEVAR` key still set to a value of `true`\n  10. Observe the environment has the `SOMEOTHERVAR` key undefined\n      <img width=\"1206\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-03-02 at 5 59 58 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/744740/13480033/b5f08052-e0a0-11e5-8faf-6db16a9e8cdd.png\">\n\n**Expected behavior:** There is some way for a package author to get access to the state of the environment as it existed when `atom` was last invoked to launch a Window.\n\n**Actual behavior:** Any changes in the environment for `atom` invocation `2...n` are not available to the package author.\n### Versions\n\nAll, <= 1.7.x.\n\n/cc @lee-dohm \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11037/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4993","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"BA78:3670:9F62B6:19A787C:59D9297A","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=160>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=158>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"0391aed04d7bdbf90edcf51dae67d2cb\"","status":"200 OK"}}
