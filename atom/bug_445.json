As I was testing out other direction keys, that's when this error came up. I tried restarting Atom, and again as I tried to move around, I got this error. I remember getting this error a few days ago on a one-line file that had an extremely long line in it.\n\nAfter restarting a 2nd time, I still can't move down past line 5279 with the arrow key or 'j', and I also can't move to the right, but I can move up and to the left. I'm not getting the error any more, but it's broken.\n\nI can still navigate using the mouse scroll wheel and clicking on a lower location, but down and right movements from the keyboard still don't work.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2422/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2421","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2421/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2421/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2421/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2421","id":34420325,"number":2421,"title":"TokenizedLine::isComment returns the wrong value for javascript blockquotes","user":{"login":"probablycorey","id":596,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/596?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey","html_url":"https://github.com/probablycorey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probablycorey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-05-27T22:46:21Z","updated_at":"2014-05-29T22:19:15Z","closed_at":"2014-05-29T22:19:15Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"### Steps to reproduce\n1.

I follow the guide [here](https://atom.io/docs/v0.99.0/writing-specs).\n\nBecause the atom plugin need an [Edit](https://atom.io/docs/api/v0.99.0/api/classes/Editor.html) instance, I have two options:\n1. Use the one under existing `atom.workspace`, which is a global variable\n2. Or, create a new empty instance using `Editor` class under `src/editor.coffee`\n\nI choose the second option. So I download the atom source code (before this step, I am using atom binary without source code). And, use `require` to import the `Editor` class. But I get some error about some packages are missing. It seems, I need to run `npm install` in atom source code folder.\n\nWhat `npm install` does is to compile the atom. But, I already have the binary atom, and I just want to make a new `Editor` class!\n\nSo, I think that is something wrong. Does anybody have ideas on how to fix this?\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2418/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2417","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2417/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2417/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2417/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2417","id":34392472,"number":2417,"title":"Replace form doesn't resize","user":{"login":"kelunik","id":2743004,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2743004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelunik","html_url":"https://github.com/kelunik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelunik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelunik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelunik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelunik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelunik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelunik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelunik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelunik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kelunik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-05-27T17:07:01Z","updated_at":"2014-05-27T17:55:03Z","closed_at":"2014-05-27T17:55:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Pasting very large contents into the replace form destroys the layout.

In order to better support packages like this I think that we should be able to support packages having dependencies.  \n\nWhat I would like to see is capabilities added for the following.\n- Subscribe to package manager to get instance of package when it is loaded\n- When loaded a subscribed package should expose instance of package created so sub modules can execute against loaded package, for instance if the workspace was a separate module we would get the workspace by subscribing to the workspace load rather than it being available globally on the atom object.\n- Ability to subscribe to loaded packages by metadata filter, something like what atom linter does to find linters that have been loaded, but subscribed like we subscribe to all current and future editors.\n- A simple interface for verifying version (via semver) of the subscribed package(s) are of the correct version, and when not alerting the user that the modules need updating.\n\nThis would give us the ability to dynamically, and bi-directionally link modules to each other.
