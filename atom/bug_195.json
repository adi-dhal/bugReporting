This PR changes it so that, in addition to paths, we can make use of a uniquely generated id for each `TextBuffer`.\n\nIf the `TokenizedBuffer`'s state has a buffer path, we deserialize it exactly as before. Otherwise, we try to search by buffer id among all the project's buffers. It might be tempting to use IDs even when we have a path, but it still seems quite reasonable to just use them as a fallback for two potential problems:\n1. Possible weird mismatches or false duplicates (e.g. two buffers have the same path, but different IDs)\n2. Even if a buffer is not present in `atom.project`, we still want re-open a buffer at that location when deserializing a `TokenizedBuffer` (I am not sure we have any guarantee that this never happens).\n\nFeedback welcome! :balloon: \n\n/cc: @nathansobo @maxbrunsfeld @atom/feedback \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9968/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9967","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9967/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9967/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9967/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9967","id":120733217,"number":9967,"title":"Cursor doesn't jump to line without column number","user":{"login":"maahd","id":3487028,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3487028?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maahd","html_url":"https://github.com/maahd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maahd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maahd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maahd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maahd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maahd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maahd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maahd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maahd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maahd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":171329633,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-reproduction","name":"needs-reproduction","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-12-07T09:33:23Z","updated_at":"2015-12-08T15:08:33Z","closed_at":"2015-12-08T15:08:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ctrl + G: \"Enter a line row:column to go to\".

the `config.cson` is being written in semi-random order (insertion order of the object properties). That makes it pretty difficult so visually find certain options or compare two `config.cson` files from different atom installations. Especially after changing configuration options back and forth the same set of config values results in a very different file.\n\nBy ordering the object properties alphabetically the output of that file becomes deterministic. The same configuration results in the same file. And diffing or comparing changes becomes much easier.\n- The first commit only contains the new spec (which obviously fails without any other changes):\n\n```\nit writes properties in alphabetical order\n    Expected [ 'foo', 'bar', 'baz' ] to equal [ 'bar', 'baz', 'foo' ].

We think it will be easier to follow if the `LinesYardstick` never forces a DOM update, but instead requires all lines being measured to be on the DOM as part of its contract.\n\nThat means we break `TextEditorComponent.updateSync` into two explicit pre-measurement and post-measurement phases directly in the component so it's more explicit to see, then add visibility checks and synchronous updates on any of the exposed measurement methods on the component.\n\nThis might have conflicts with block decorations, but it's going to make it easier for us to maneuver as we render via the `DisplayLayer`'s `TokenIterator` instead of from `TokenizedLines`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9947/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9946","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9946/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9946/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9946/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9946","id":120434200,"number":9946,"title":"Uncaught
