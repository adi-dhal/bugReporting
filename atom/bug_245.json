This is related to #4974, #4975, and #4122.\n## The Issue:\n\nTrying to use Atom at work (to hopefully replace Notepad++), and was able to install Atom fine without a problem. However, when I went to install some packages, I received the following error:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7026750/9408312/9fad910e-47df-11e5-8bb3-ff1230a1939f.png)\n\nSame thing for themes:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7026750/9408324/bcc3a9ae-47df-11e5-8f5b-16b14509cc4c.png)\n\nAnd same thing for the featured packages:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7026750/9408333/d64225cc-47df-11e5-93d7-2526ee7d3339.png)\n\nAnd featured themes:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7026750/9408336/e8349b98-47df-11e5-84d9-e235e9b05ccb.png)\n## Background:\n\nWe use [Palo Alto Security Appliances](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/platforms/firewalls/pa-5000/overview.html) to protect our ingress and egress network traffic from malware and other threats to our network and data. Palo Alto does this by using a wildcard certificate that has been generated from our Enterprise PKI and which is trusted on all Company-owned workstations and servers.\n\n> Not looking to get into a debate about SSL decryption or man-in-the-middle attacks for SSL. This is at my work, and we have legal and regulatory requirements to break SSL, inspect the traffic, and then re-encrypt it before it leaves our network.\n\nI know _why_ Atom is failing here. It's seeing what it thinks is a bad certificate in the mix, and that the traffic is being attacked (MiTM). I understand _why_ Atom is failing here. But in this case, the traffic is _legitimately_ being broken, for _legitimate_ reasons.\n## Feature Request:\n\nI would like to request the addition of a hidden configuration option that, when enabled, would cause Atom to **ignore SSL certificate errors**.\n\n> Yes I know this is risky for end-users. Yes, I know this reduces the overall security, which is why I don't think the configuration setting should be easily \"discoverable\" or that there shouldn't be a UI element for it. Hopefully that wouldn't allow a non-technical user to accidentally enable it and potentially reduce their security.\n### Alternately:\n\nIf Atom would show the actual URL that's being blocked, or that raised the error, we could then add the URL to a white-list to bypass SSL decryption on our side, allowing packages and themes  to be installed.\n\nOf course, it would be helpful if packages and themes were distributed from a central repository with a common organizational structure and naming convention. :smile: \n\n---\n\nThanks so much for considering this feature request.\n\nRunning Atom 1.0.7 on Windows 7 Enterprise SP1.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8465/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8464","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8464/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8464/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8464/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8464","id":102369882,"number":8464,"title":"Strange keyboard","user":{"login":"ezequias","id":539561,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/539561?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezequias","html_url":"https://github.com/ezequias","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezequias/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezequias/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezequias/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezequias/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezequias/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezequias/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezequias/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezequias/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezequias/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-08-21T12:32:21Z","updated_at":"2015-08-21T15:07:05Z","closed_at":"2015-08-21T12:46:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello everyone\n\nI am in trouble to print the slash key \"/\" on Atom.

working on character measurement, I stumbled upon `mouseWheelScreenRow` and tried to reason a bit about it.\n\nThe reason why it exists is to let the browser continue firing `mousewheel` events even when the original line goes off-screen. Using this approach, instead of deleting it as we would do for other lines, we keep it around in the DOM until scrolling finishes.\n\nThis PR attempts to change that by forcing the browser to fire `mousewheel` events on the parent element. To achieve this, I made use of the following CSS:\n\n``` css\n.lines {\n  * {\n    pointer-events: none;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis will prevent any kind of mouse interaction with `.lines` and `.line-numbers` descendants and therefore I am not sure about the implications of this solution. Fold icons in the gutter stopped working, but everything else seems to work nicely. I guess the question is: can we find a way to make `.lines` or `.line-numbers` the target of `mouse wheel` events?\n\nThis was a pretty quick fix to demonstrate the idea so I just opened a PR but we can easily discard it if it's unfeasible.\n\n/cc: @nathansobo @maxbrunsfeld @atom/feedback \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8455","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8455/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8455/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8455/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8455","id":102136321,"number":8455,"title":"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'getFlexScale' of undefined","user":{"login":"kevinsimper","id":1126497,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1126497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsimper","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinsimper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsimper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsimper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsimper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsimper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsimper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsimper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsimper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsimper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsimper/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":211058624,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/uncaught-exception","name":"uncaught-exception","color":"e11d21","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-08-20T13:14:55Z","updated_at":"2015-08-21T09:36:22Z","closed_at":"2015-08-21T09:36:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"1.

I'll probably merge it once it's green regardless, but it would be good to confirm it fixes the issue you're experiencing that I can't repro.\n\nOn recent versions of OS X Yosemite, there is a delay before we receive the `mouseup` event when dragging selections with the trackpad. This means that we’re frequently accidentally inserting text before the selection process terminates, leading to unexpected selections after the text insertion. This fixes that behavior and makes the behavior more straightforward even in the case where the mouse button is remains held down during text insertion.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8445","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8445/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8445/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8445/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8445","id":101956786,"number":8445,"title":"Uncaught
