I have a package that's only activated in response to the `my-package:start` command, and in response to that command, it adds an instance of `MyPackageView` as a new item in the current `Pane`.  \n\nIf I want that view to be serialized when the editor closes, it seems like I'd just register deserialization like this:\n\n``` coffeescript\nclass MyPackageView\n  atom.deserializers.add(this)\n\n  constructor: (@data) -> #property assigned\n  serialize: -> { deserializer: 'MyPackageView', data: @data } \n  @deserialize: ({data}) -> new MyPackageView(data)\n```\n\n(from [serialization docs](https://atom.io/docs/latest/advanced/serialization), see also [DeserializeManager](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/v0.133.0/src/deserializer-manager.coffee#L24))\n\nBut the problem with this is that, if we add this view and then close/reopen Atom, it can't find `MyPackageView` when trying to deserialize this pane item.\n\nIt seems that instead of loading the package but then waiting until activation event to call `activate()`, the package isn't even being _loaded_ until the activation event fires.  I'm not sure whether this is the intended behavior or not, but based on the comments about deferring `require`s in #2654 and also in [How To Speed Up Your Packages](https://discuss.atom.io/t/how-to-speed-up-your-packages/10903), it appears to be a change, one consequence of this is that deferring `require` until `activate()` makes no difference to application load time.  (Although, deferring it until some point even later than that could still speed up _package_ activation time.)\n\nIf this is actually the intended behavior of the package loading system, then one approach would be to register your package (or have it automatically inferred) when doing `deseralizers.add()`, so that the package could be stored as deserializer metadata, and then loaded during deserialization if necessary.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3694","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3694/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3694/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3694/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3694","id":44597535,"number":3694,"title":"On OS X the update icon after a \"restart and update\" is still shown","user":{"login":"bobber205","id":5841107,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5841107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobber205","html_url":"https://github.com/bobber205","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobber205/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobber205/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobber205/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobber205/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobber205/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobber205/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobber205/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobber205/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobber205/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2014-10-01T18:16:18Z","updated_at":"2014-10-01T21:15:13Z","closed_at":"2014-10-01T21:15:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Needs another restart to get rid of \n![managed_source_maintainer_worker_rb_-__users_alexwait_chirpify_respiratory-system_and_new_issue_ _atom_atom](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5841107/4480401/02efe3a4-4997-11e4-9d8a-38e112a861df.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3694/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3693","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3693/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3693/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3693/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3693","id":44590563,"number":3693,"title":"Reloading of Tabs","user":{"login":"stramel","id":855184,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/855184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stramel","html_url":"https://github.com/stramel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stramel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stramel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stramel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stramel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stramel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stramel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stramel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stramel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stramel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-10-01T17:15:44Z","updated_at":"2014-10-01T21:11:25Z","closed_at":"2014-10-01T21:11:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am running:\n- **OS**: Ubuntu 14.04\n- **Atom**: 0.134.0-cd8c669 (master branch)\n\nI just noticed today after my update that when I open the `Settings` tab that it causes all the tabs to flash and essentially reload the tab multiple times.

The drop downs show up with the correct vertical offset, but are horizontally pinned to the right side of the primary monitor.\n\nStrangely enough, the occurrence of this bug appears to be dependent on the drop down's expected (as in, where the drop down SHOULD be) distance from the primary monitor. Drop down's too close to the primary monitor get pulled onto the primary monitor, while drop down's far enough away show up with the correct positioning. I tried to show this in the screenshots below.\n\nMy guess is that this has something to do with DPI scaling in Windows 8.1. My primary display has a high DPI, so it's set to 125% scaling in Windows. My secondary monitor has normal 100% scaling. And it does look like the 'cut off' distance where the drop downs switch between monitors is exactly 25% from the edge of the other monitor. I'm just guessing though.\n\n![screen1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7724154/4477314/06e06cfa-497d-11e4-8469-8c5d5846a28a.jpg)\n![screen2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7724154/4477316/0c5da5c6-497d-11e4-8643-bbddb35800ac.jpg)\n![screen3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7724154/4477829/cca53df0-4980-11e4-8d45-ed2d612e1adb.jpg)\n![screen4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7724154/4477831/d02af35c-4980-11e4-93bc-6093981cc090.jpg)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3688","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3688/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3688/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3688/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/3688","id":44565179,"number":3688,"title":"Upgrade

@nathansobo \n\nWe've added a model-to-view [view provider API](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/3587) to workspace to encourage users to interact with the model instead of touching the view when manipulating panes and their items. However, if you want to manipulate peripheral panels such as the tree view and status bar, it's still necessary to touch the DOM directly. This roadmap item aims to fix that by adding a model-level API for _panels_ that's similar to our API for panes.\n## View Correspondence\n\nWe will use the same view registration mechanism that we use for pane items to associate views with the contents of panels. To allow the workspace to construct a view for a panel, register a provider for it just like you would for a pane item's model. I'm using the name `ProjectBrowser` instead of `TreeView` at the model layer to clarify the distinction between the view and the model.\n\n``` coffee\natom.workspace.addViewProvider\n  modelClass: ProjectBrowser\n  viewClass: ProjectBrowserElement\n```\n\nNow, whenever a panel model is constructed with a `ProjectBrowser` as its `item`, at the view layer a `ProjectBrowserElement` will be constructed at the view layer.\n## Model API\n\nA new `Panel` class will be introduced in the workspace, which the user can create via a method on workspace:\n\n``` coffee\npanel = atom.workspace.addLeftPanel(item: new ProjectBrowser)\npanel.hide() # Hide the panel\npanel.show() # Show the panel\natom.workspace.addRightPanel(panel) # Move the panel to the right\npanel.destroy() # Remove the panel entirely\n```\n\nResizing support, currently implemented in a custom way in the `tree-view` package, could be provided by our `PanelElement` wrapper. You just indicate that you want the panel to be resizable with a boolean `resizable` parameter when adding the panel. We could potentially specify more detail, such as max/min dimensions etc.\n\n``` coffee\npanel = atom.workspace.addLeftPanel(\n  item: new ProjectBrowser\n  resizable: true\n)\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3680/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3679","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3679/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3679/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3679/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3679","id":44499240,"number":3679,"title":"Custom elements for built-in components","user":{"login":"benogle","id":69169,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/69169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle","html_url":"https://github.com/benogle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":163641905,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/atom","name":"atom","color":"f7c6c7","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-09-30T20:59:58Z","updated_at":"2017-02-06T18:28:09Z","closed_at":"2017-02-06T15:59:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Status: Initial planning / brainstorming\n\nVia @nathansobo \n\nWe have `SelectListView` and `ScrollView` that still require SpacePen interactions.

Pull request ready to review/merge.\n\nVia @nathansobo \n\nHere's an initial take:\n\nWe want to make it easier to work with files from various locations on disk from within the same Atom window, and the features we have in mind will impact the project API. Conceptually, the two primary changes we want to make are the following:\n- Projects can contain multiple folders.\n  - The fuzzy finder should search across all a project's folders.\n  - The tree view should display all a project's folders.\n- Workspaces can contain multiple projects.\n  - At any one time, there is an \"active\" project.\n  - The fuzzy finder searches across only one active project at a time.\n  - The tree view can show multiple projects, with the active project\n    emphasized in some way.\n\nThe API implications for this seem to be as follows:\n- Multi-folder projects\n  - `Project::getPath`, `::getRepo` etc need to be replaced by `::getPaths`,\n    `::getRepositories`, `::getDirectories`, etc.\n  - The `Directory` class should probably be expanded to include some of the\n    methods on `Project`.\n  - `Project::scan` and `::replace` can continue to work across all directories.\n- Multi-project workspaces\n  - Replace `atom.project` with `Workspace::getActiveProject`.\n  - Add `Workspace::getProjects`\n\nAt first we may just want to add the pluralized APIs for reading, but not add methods to enable multiple directories/projects to actually be added.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3676/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3675","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3675/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3675/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3675/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3675","id":44498148,"number":3675,"title":"Windows

This roadmap also proposes adding a `Config::onDidChange` method to replace the `callNow` property to `::observe`.\n## Tasks\n### Config schema\n\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/pull/3613\n\nAdd types and things to the config. \n- [x] Use a schema for specifying config \n- [x] Deprecate all the `getInt` style methods\n- [x] Eliminate `callNow: false`\n- [x] Add `Config::onDidChange` API\n### Move syntax properties into config\n\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/pull/3697\n\nCurrently `Syntax` supports scoped config settings. It doesnt make sense to have multiple config systems. This unifies them and will put us in a good place to do scoped configs (eg. enable softwrap for markdown, hard tabs for bash, etc). See https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2593, https://github.com/atom/language-make/issues/3\n- [x] Add optional selectors to `Config::get/set`\n- [x] Forward deprecated writes to `atom.syntax` to `atom.config`\n- [x] Forward deprecated reads on `atom.syntax` to `atom.config`\n- [x] Read from `atom.config` instead of `atom.syntax`\n- [x] Register scoped properties with `atom.config` instead of `atom.syntax` when loading packages.\n- [x] Allow scoped settings to be observed\n## API\n### Writing Scoped Settings\n\nWe can add an optional selector as the first argument to `Config::set` and `Config::setDefaults`. For example, this enabled soft-wrapping on anything in the `.gfm` scope, but disables it for code blocks _within_ markdown. (We would need to update the editor to be capable of honoring these settings within a given scope).\n\n``` coffee\natom.config.set('.gfm', 'editor.softWrapped', true)\natom.config.set('.gfm .source', 'editor.softWrapped', false)\n```\n### Reading Scoped Settings\n\nWe can update `Config::get` and `Config::observe` to take an optional token that must match against selectors. Here's an example of determining if we should use soft-tabs in a particular context:\n\n``` coffee\ntoken = editor.tokenForBufferPosition([5, 3])\natom.config.get(token, 'editor.softTabbed')\n```\n### Observing Scoped Settings\n\nWe can also extend the API to allow scoped settings to be observed. This should assume that the token is immutable, meaning that if the token's scope changes we'll need to set up a new observation:\n\n``` coffee\natom.config.observe token, 'editor.softTabbed', (value) -> # ...\n```\n### ~~Eliminating callNow: false~~\n\nOne final change, unrelated to the scoped properties, is to add a simple `::onDidChange` method to `Config` that replaces the `callNow: false` option to `::observe`. This brings the config API into line with changes we've made elsewhere, where `::observeFoo` calls the callback immediately and `::onDidChangeFoo` calls it only on the next change.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3674/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3673","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3673/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3673/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3673/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3673","id":44497135,"number":3673,"title":"Improve startup time","user":{"login":"benogle","id":69169,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/69169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle","html_url":"https://github.com/benogle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benogle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":163641905,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/atom","name":"atom","color":"f7c6c7","default":false},{"id":133796716,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/on-deck","name":"on-deck","color":"fad8c7","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":45,"created_at":"2014-09-30T20:39:40Z","updated_at":"2017-03-08T21:47:52Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Status: This is an ongoing effort.\n\nVia @kevinsawicki \n\nThe current plan is to investigate what is slow on startup, optimize it, and then investigate concatenating all the CoffeeScript requires to save eval time on startup.\n### Merged Changes\n\nTimes below are were taken with a Macbook Pro on OS X 10.8.5 with 2.6 Ghz Intel Core i7 processors and 16 GB of memory\n- https://github.com/atom/less-cache/commit/dbddce5d34aee85f8b3687d5ec9e5837bdb9bb7a\n  -

This dramatically affects startup time since **each** version can take up to **10-15ms** to require.\n\nOne solution is to add a seeded cache of common package modules in `~/.atom/packages/node_modules` that would be populated and maintained by `apm` such that `apm install` would also dedupe modules across packages.\n\nThen we can just document the _common_ modules and tell people to add something like this to their `package.json` file (and possibly include in `apm init`)  if they want to use them:\n\n``` json\n\"dependencies\": {\n  \"pathwatcher\": \"^3\",\n  \"underscore-plus\": \"^2\",\n  \"fs-plus\": \"^2\",\n  \"event-kit\": \"^1\",\n  \"space-pencil\": \"^1\"\n}\n```\n\nThis offers a nice middle-ground where we don't have to export these common modules and worry about bumping the Atom major version when one changes its major version, we can just recommend what versions packages authors bind to and control and maintain a well-tuned cache of them so that depending on them doesn't slow down your package.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3671","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3671/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3671/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3671/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/3671","id":44494568,"number":3671,"title":"Return
