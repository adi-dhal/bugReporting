Open file in atom\r\n2. Type\r\n3. Wait 1 or 2sec\r\n4.

Due to the way our code was structured, the `onDidAddCursor` event was being fired before the new selection had the chance to be stored in the editor state: as a result, when someone tried to call `editor.getLastSelection` during a \"cursor added\" event, Atom would retry to create a selection, thus firing again the `onDidAddCursor` event and causing the infinite loop.\r\n\r\nThis pull request fixes the above problem by emitting the `did-add-cursor` event after the selection has been successfully added to the editor state.\r\n\r\n/cc: @atom/maintainers

ZenHub is the only project management tool integrated natively in GitHub – created specifically for fast-moving, software-driven teams.\n\n----\n\n#### How do I use ZenHub?\n\nTo get set up with ZenHub, all you have to do is **[download the browser extension](https://www.zenhub.com?utm_source=ZHOnboarding)** and log in with your GitHub account. Once you do, you’ll get access to ZenHub’s complete feature-set immediately.\n\n#### What can ZenHub do?\n\nZenHub adds a series of enhancements directly inside the GitHub UI:\n\n- Real-time, customizable task boards for GitHub issues;\n- Multi-Repository burndown charts, estimates, and velocity tracking based on GitHub Milestones;\n- Personal to-do lists and task prioritization;\n- Time-saving shortcuts – like a quick repo switcher, a “Move issue” button, and much more.\n\n### [Add ZenHub to GitHub](https://www.zenhub.com?utm_source=ZHOnboarding)\n\n_Still curious?

(so I might not have said no on that dialog)\r\n\r\n### How was the internet service connected\r\n\r\nI got an exception, and it clearly refers to an issue on github which was already reported. I didn't click anything to make this happen, and still it clearly connected to some service to get this sort of information:\r\n![atom-online-github](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1573352/22157573/804b1a10-df38-11e6-9386-268f258b4c84.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nSince this is a one time incident for me, I'm not perfectly sure. It might be enough to just observe some exception.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** With exception-reporting and metrics disabled and no consent given for data collection, no internet service should be consulted ever without user interaction (package install, explicit query for error details, ..)\r\n**Actual behavior:** Some online service appears to be consulted\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** unknown\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\njonas@cyberman:~$ atom --version\r\nAtom    : 1.12.7\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\njonas@cyberman:~$ apm --version\r\napm  1.12.9\r\nnpm  3.10.5\r\nnode 4.4.5\r\npython 2.7.12\r\ngit 2.9.3\r\njonas@cyberman:~$\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nAny additional information, configuration or data that might be necessary to reproduce the issue.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13669/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13668","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13668/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13668/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13668/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13668","id":202149745,"number":13668,"title":"Don't transform deprecated selectors containing malformed CSS","user":{"login":"as-cii","id":482957,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/482957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii","html_url":"https://github.com/as-cii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-01-20T14:14:07Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T12:36:24Z","closed_at":"2017-01-23T12:36:24Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/13668","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13668","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13668.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13668.patch"},"body":"Fixes #13663.\r\n\r\nThis pull request fixes an error that was thrown by `postcss` when trying to upgrade deprecated selectors of a file containing malformed CSS.

Previously we were relying on Chrome always reporting `<atom-text-editor>` as the mousewheel `event.target`. As a result, removing the shadow boundary caused the mousewheel event to be potentially dispatched from anywhere inside the editor element, making our previous logic for handling ctrl-mousewheel invalid.\r\n\r\nThis pull request fixes it by recognizing mousewheel events that are dispatched from within an editor.\r\n\r\n/cc: @atom/core","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13667/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4159","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507404130","x-github-request-id":"88D6:3670:9ED7BC:19904C0:59D92820","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=73>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=71>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"8eb44c9a1dd866904ff7876579dd9e27\"","status":"200 OK"}}
