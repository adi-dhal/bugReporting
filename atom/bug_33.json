Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.\r\n* All new code requires tests to ensure against regressions\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nWe must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI commented out the \"Dependancy Status\" in the README.md, because in current time, the dependency status hosted on https://david-dm.org/atom/atom, is giving a 502 Bad Gateway error. I chose to comment out, and not delete because the website could be fixed in the near future.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain what other alternates were considered and why the proposed version was selected -->\r\nNo other alternatives were considered, as a search in \"Issues\" of \"Error 502\" takes nothing up. An alternative to this choice would be to delete the code, but that would stop the potential for a fix when the website does get fixed.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain why this functionality should be in atom/atom as opposed to a package -->\r\nThis functionality is not affecting ATOM directly (to my knowledge) and only affects the GitHub repository for ATOM, so this question does not apply.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\n<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->\r\nWill fix a temporary error, causing less confusion, and more polish, for visitors looking at the repository.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\n<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->\r\nIf the code was changed into a comment, and the website was fixed, the fix would not be realized and would have to be manually checked.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\n<!-- Enter any applicable Issues here

To keep our scope from creeping uncontrollably, the first version we ship will target _only_ the minimum functionality that we need for bundled core packages and @damieng's language server integration.\r\n\r\nSee the original discussion in #14163.\r\n\r\n## API\r\n\r\nThis will add two public methods to subscribe to filesystem changes, an \"extended\" general-purpose one to recursively watch any directory tree, and a \"public\" specialized one to watch for changes within project roots that are open within `atom.projects`.\r\n\r\nThe general-purpose one will involve calling `watchPath` instances directly, by means of a function exported from the `atom` require:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst {watchPath} = require('atom')\r\n\r\nconst watcher = watchPath(rootPath, {}, events => {\r\n  // Accept batch of events\r\n})\r\n\r\nconst disposable1 = watcher.onDidError(err => {\r\n  // Handle error\r\n})\r\n\r\n// After this promise resolves, changes made to files on the filesystem will result in\r\n// the registered callback(s) being invoked\r\nawait watcher.getStartPromise()\r\n\r\n// After this promise resolves, all OS watcher resources will be disposed\r\nawait watcher.dispose()\r\ndisposable1.dispose()\r\n```\r\n\r\n * `rootPath` can be a path anywhere on the filesystem.\r\n * If `rootPath` is a directory, its contents will be watched recursively. If it's an individual file, only that file will be watched.\r\n * The `PathWatcher` instances returned by `watchPath()` may be backed by an existing native filesystem watcher on the same root path or a parent directory.\r\n * The native watcher may also be swapped out if a watcher is started on a parent directory, or if its native watcher is assigned to a parent directory but the parent watcher is disposed. All of these changes are transparent to consumers.\r\n * `getStartPromise()` is useful to have for writing test cases - you want to be sure the watcher is initialized and receiving events before manipulating the filesystem. It will _not_ be necessary to wait for the watcher to start before subscribing to events, though.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst disposable = atom.project.onDidChangeFiles(events => {\r\n  // ..\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n * This API will be implemented with the other. Notably, watchers created here will participate in the deduping process described above.\r\n * As new roots are added to the project or removed, existing event subscriptions will be adjusted accordingly.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the payload delivered to the change callback is an Array with the following structure:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"action\": \"\", // one of \"modified\", \"created\", \"deleted\", or \"renamed\"\r\n    \"oldPath\": \"\", // undefined unless type is \"renamed,\" in which case it holds the former name of the entry\r\n    \"path\": \"\" // absolute path to the changed entry\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n🗒  I'm writing this initial cut with [nsfw](https://github.com/Axosoft/nsfw) (which we use in the GitHub package). I'm planning to merge this PR still using nsfw and cutting atom/github over to using it as part of the next release so we're no worse off in stable than we are today.\r\n\r\nAfter :ship:, I'll replace it with a bespoke native watching module. nsfw launches two threads for each watched directory root, which makes me nervous to use it to back a user-facing API.\r\n\r\n## Remaining Work\r\n\r\n- [x] Create a `NativeWatcherRegistry` to manage the attachment of native watchers to userland watchers.\r\n  - [x] Re-use native watchers for exact directories\r\n  - [x] Re-use existing native watchers on parent directories\r\n  - [x] Replace native watchers on child directories with a new watcher on a parent directory\r\n  - [x] Remove unused native watchers\r\n  - [x] Re-watch individual child directories when a parent directory's watcher is removed\r\n  - [x] Documentation complete\r\n  - [x] Test coverage\r\n    - [x] More complicated watcher splits: parent-child relationships among the child watchers\r\n- [x] Implement a `NativeWatcher` to translate native watcher library events to match the spec :point_up:\r\n  - [x] Rebroadcast change events through an event-kit `Emitter`\r\n  - [x] Broadcast an event when event consumers should attach themselves to a new `NativeWatcher` instead\r\n  - [x] Handle errors... somehow\r\n  - [x] Begin watching lazily when the first change subscriber is registered\r\n  - [x] Automatically shut down when no subscribers exist\r\n- [x] Create a `PathWatcher` object and `watchPath` function to supply the user-facing watcher API\r\n  - [x] Broadcast `onDidStart` when attached to a native watcher that has begun listening for events\r\n  - [x] Rebroadcast `onDidChange` events to subscribers\r\n  - [x] Change `onDidStart` to the more useful `getStartPromise`\r\n  - [x] Lazily create `onDidChange` subscription\r\n  - [x] Documentation complete\r\n- [x] Re-export the `watchPath` function from `\"atom\"`\r\n  - [x] Documentation\r\n- [x] Implement `atom.project.onDidChangeFiles()` using PathWatchers\r\n  - [x] Tests\r\n  - [x] Documentation\r\n- [x] Take it for a final spin\r\n- [x] Implement a feature flag\r\n- [x] Verify that the docs look okay in Joanna\r\n- [x] Ensure CI is green","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14853/reactions","total_count":20,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":6,"confused":0,"heart":7}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14852","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14852/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14852/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14852/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14852","id":237320371,"number":14852,"title":"Uncaught TypeError: validateEventDispatches is not a function (Atom-Runner plugin)","user":{"login":"gaumeister","id":327838,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/327838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaumeister","html_url":"https://github.com/gaumeister","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaumeister/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaumeister/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaumeister/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaumeister/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaumeister/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaumeister/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaumeister/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaumeister/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaumeister/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":228907388,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wrong-repo","name":"wrong-repo","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-06-20T19:34:04Z","updated_at":"2017-06-20T22:39:35Z","closed_at":"2017-06-20T22:39:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[Enter steps to reproduce:]\r\n\r\n1.

I am thrilled with this new feature. This feature would in my opinion increase the usefulness even more. It's about the same as what SourceTree does although they periodically fetch information to keep the numbers accurate.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\nIt would be handy if Atom could show the number of pulls/pushes next to a project folder's name in the project pane. This would allow for a global overview if you have multiple projects open.\r\nFor example: ```my_project    2  1``` where 2 would be the number of pulls and 1 the number of pushes that are pending.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\nCurrently only the project name is shown\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\nnew

This brings back the behavior of Atom 1.18.
