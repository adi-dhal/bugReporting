now Atom stores off (near?) complete state on exit, so when opening it will restore everything back to how it was. This is nice for some people and some aspects of the editor, but I personally don't want to have all that state stored. For one, I like a clean start when sitting down to work so having the tree view remember all the folders that were open or having all previously open files pop up isn't helpful to me. Additionally I'd bet that having it reopen a bunch of files is adding extra startup time which, since I don't want those files open anyway, is another negative side-effect.\n\nIf there are already unexposed settings for this, let me know and I'll just add them to my config. :)\n\nOr if someone can point me in the right direction I can see about implementing these settings myself. I'd just need a couple pointers on how to work with the config and where the functionality in question would be found in the source code. \n\nIdeally the option(s) would apply both proactively (i.e. when enabled, don't even write the given state to disk) and retroactively (i.e. when enabled, clear applicable state on load). That way there's no wasted time saving state the user chooses to ignore, but if the user already had save state, it gets ignored on the next launch.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4772/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4771","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4771/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4771/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4771/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4771","id":52938964,"number":4771,"title":"Uncaught TypeError: Unable to watch path","user":{"login":"davidcastellani","id":2530838,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2530838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidcastellani","html_url":"https://github.com/davidcastellani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidcastellani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidcastellani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidcastellani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidcastellani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidcastellani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidcastellani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidcastellani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidcastellani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidcastellani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false},{"id":211058624,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/uncaught-exception","name":"uncaught-exception","color":"e11d21","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-12-26T21:03:01Z","updated_at":"2017-07-09T00:41:30Z","closed_at":"2017-07-09T00:41:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[Enter steps to reproduce below:]\n1.

from [here](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4721#issuecomment-68152049):\nThat happened a couple of times while working on the currently selected theme in atom. Every couple of theme reloads (after saving one of the less files) I was left with a newly initialized config file.\n\nI noticed this because I deactivated the welcome package and every time the config file is reset the welcome screen opens in all instances and the theme switches to atom dark.\n\nOnce one of the instances initialized a new config file, while another instance overwrote it with the old config file again. Because the welcome page opened but when I looked at the config it was the old one with the deactivated welcome package.\n\n@maxbrunsfeld I don't know if it also happens in safe mode, I didn't work in safe mode and I just tried to reproduce it by changing and saving some less files of the current theme, but without success. Maybe has also to do with one atom window being in debug mode and the other not?\n\nThis is the config file it reset mine into:\n\n``` coffeescript\n'global':\n  'welcome':\n    'showOnStartup': false\n  'editor': {}\n'.js.regexp.source':\n  'editor': {}\n'.js.source':\n  'editor':\n    'softWrapAtPreferredLineLength': false\n    'softWrap': false\n'.gfm.source':\n  'editor':\n    'softWrap':
