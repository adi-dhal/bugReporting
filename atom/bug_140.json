Error-Notification with an Error as parameter and probably saves some developers some seldom Exceptions complaining about the wrong data type of the message.\n\nAs a nifty Addon, the Notification could treat `err.stack` as the detail-option.\n\nüç∞ ‚òï \n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Deliver an (NodeJS) `Error`-object to `atom.notifications.addError()` as `message`-parameter.\n\n**Expected behavior:** Atom should display the `Error.message` as `message` and `Error.stack` as `detail`.\n\n**Actual behavior:** Atom raises an Exception:\n\n```\nError: Notification must be created with string message: <...>\n```\n### Versions\n\n```\napm  1.9.2\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode

The first stage performs a binary search on the text nodes of a row to find the node containing the pixelPosition. The second stage performs a binary search within the text node to find the character that contains the pixelPosition. This improves responsiveness when clicking near the end of a very long line of text.\n\n~~This adds a dependency on [`binary-search-with-index`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/binary-search-with-index), which is my fork of [`binary-search`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/binary-search). This fork passes the index to the comparator which is needed in the `characterComparator`, and also relicenses the package to MIT. The original package was CC0-1.0 and waived all copyrights, so this should be okay.~~\n\n**Update**: The original package accepted my PR, so the only thing preventing us from using it is that its `CC0-1.0` license doesn't pass the [`legal-eagle`](https://github.com/atom/legal-eagle) check. Might be a better idea to patch `legal-eagle` to accept `CC0-1.0` since it does accept public domain.\n\nResolves

I couldn't find out when this happens actually, but it happens and breaks [atom-editorconfig](https://github.com/sindresorhus/atom-editorconfig).\n\nüìå  I created a hopefully self-explaining spec: https://gist.github.com/florianb/ccc1ec184b86f139f9cadee71dc26f7b\n\nGive me a hint if i am wrong or if you need more information.

Opening a second file opens in the same window in a new tab. This is expected.\n\nAfter changing to a different workspace (B) in Ubuntu where no Atom window is present and then opening another file, the file will open in the Atom window present on the first workspace (A). However, the expected behavior is that the file is opened in a new window of Atom.\n\nMy notion of expected behavior is derived from what is done by Gedit, the default text editor on Ubuntu. It also seems more intuitive to me that the file is opened on the workspace I'm currently viewing, even if Atom is already present on a different workspace. This follows an idea of using different workspaces for different tasks.\n\nSome might disagree with this suggestion, but I would still like to see this as an optional behavior because this issue is one of the most often mentioned by those I know who use Atom.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open a file in Atom from the file manager in Ubuntu on workspace (A).\n2. Change workspace to workspace (B).\n3. Open a second file in Atom from the file manager.\n\n**Expected behavior:** Two Atom windows open, one on workspace (A) with the first file and one on workspace (B) with the second file.\n\n**Actual behavior:** One Atom window opened on workspace (A) with both files.\n### Versions\n\nUbuntu 15.10 and Ubuntu 16.04 running Unity 7.\n\n``` bash\n$ atom --version\nAtom    : 1.7.2\nElectron: 0.36.8\nChrome  : 47.0.2526.110\nNode    : 5.1.1\n\n$¬†apm --version\napm  1.9.2\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.11+\ngit 2.7.4\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11610/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11609","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11609/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11609/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11609/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11609","id":151077757,"number":11609,"title":"Atom TopMost on VirtualBox Ubuntu Machine","user":{"login":"LeMerP","id":6209900,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6209900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeMerP","html_url":"https://github.com/LeMerP","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeMerP/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeMerP/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeMerP/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeMerP/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeMerP/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeMerP/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeMerP/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeMerP/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeMerP/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-04-26T08:50:03Z","updated_at":"2016-05-05T17:18:16Z","closed_at":"2016-04-26T09:14:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\n\nIf you run Atom on Ubuntu Trusty or Xenial within a VirtualBox environment under Windows 10, the Atom window has always a topmost state.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.
