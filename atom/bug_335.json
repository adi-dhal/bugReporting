But maybe handling 1 is enough.\n\nFor 3: As a developer I was unaware that this was happening. I'm using the package with apm link so it doesn't get processed in the same way.

Other related issues: https://github.com/atom/styleguide/pull/25, #4342, #3792,  https://github.com/atom/settings-view/issues/307, https://github.com/atom/atom-dark-ui/issues/24\n#### Problem:\n\nUnlike the Syntax font size, there isn't an easy way to change the font size for the UI.\n#### Current options:\n\n**1. Styles.less** Anything can be overridden in `styles.less`. Works great for tweaks in certain areas, but can't really be used to override all font sizes at once.\n\n**2. Themes** Themes that are based on the `rem/em` units can be scaled by only changing the root element like `html { font-size: 14px; }`. To my knowledge, currently only [isotope-ui](https://atom.io/themes/isotope-ui) supports that.\n\n**3. Zoom** It's possible to change the zoom level in `init.coffee`:\n\n``` coffee\nrequire('web-frame').setZoomFactor(2)\n```\n\n[See this discussion](https://discuss.atom.io/t/how-to-set-the-font-for-the-settings-ui-and-the-command-browser/13498/4). Works for all themes, but could have some px rounding issues.\n#### Possible improvements (future):\n1. Add a way to override Less variables from `styles.less`, themes and in the settings. There was an attempt but needs to be investigated further: https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/4153#issuecomment-73980380 \n2. Switch everything to `rem/em` based font units. But this won't happen for 1.0 since it might break existing themes, packages and people's `styles.less`. Maybe for 2.0 if overriding Less variables isn't possible till then.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5735/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5734","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5734/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5734/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5734/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5734","id":58884178,"number":5734,"title":"delete EOL: remove preceding whitespace of line","user":{"login":"stijnsanders","id":504770,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/504770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stijnsanders","html_url":"https://github.com/stijnsanders","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stijnsanders/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stijnsanders/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stijnsanders/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stijnsanders/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stijnsanders/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stijnsanders/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stijnsanders/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stijnsanders/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stijnsanders/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722938,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/package-idea","name":"package-idea","color":"bfd4f2","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-02-25T10:57:07Z","updated_at":"2016-04-29T22:51:57Z","closed_at":"2016-04-29T22:51:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"In the case where you have the cursor at the end of the line, and press delete to remove then EOL, any whitespace at the beginning of the following line should be removed before it is added to the line where the cursor is on.

with:\n- Rename tree-view commands to clarify `Add Folder` vs `Add Root Folder` - @50Wliu\n- Persist combinations of root folders via an explicit project file, not based on which paths were originally opened - @wvanlint\n- `atom path1 path2` should always result in both paths being added to the project, even if `path2` had previously been manually removed from the project last time Atom was opened with those paths - @D-side\n- Project files should be strictly optional - @mark-hahn \n- Project files should be implemented in a way that would later allow storing project-specific settings - @lee-dohm.\n- Multiple folders need to be sortable -

At the time the error occurred, I had a momentary slow down, where atom / the VM was not responding quickly.  I **think** what happened, is I did &lt;ctrl>x a second time on a highlighted word before the first had been processed, and my finger slipped over and also did a &lt;ctrl>z.  Don't really know which got there first.  I saw the same thing with an older version of atom (about 0.173), but ignored it when I saw the 'already reported' message.  This time I had a look at the report, and saw that it had been closed.\n\nJust incase it overlaps.  I saw some reports about problems using split tabs.  When the error occurred, there were no splits, but earlier in the session I had 3 splits open (Split Down) for a single file, editing in all 3.\n\nAs you can see from the config report, this is a pretty bare environment.  Quite new to using atom, and have not done any real customizing, other than tabs-to-spaces.\n\nAfter collecting the details for reporting, the session continued.
