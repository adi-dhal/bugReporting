There should be separate building instructions for the various platforms.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4202/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4201","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4201/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4201/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4201/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4201","id":48970637,"number":4201,"title":"Consider bundling default font","user":{"login":"wutong","id":2195901,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2195901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wutong","html_url":"https://github.com/wutong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wutong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wutong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wutong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wutong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wutong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wutong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wutong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wutong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wutong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true},{"id":343564310,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/typography","name":"typography","color":"eb6420","default":false},{"id":193722981,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/ui","name":"ui","color":"99cc00","default":false},{"id":150782082,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/wontfix","name":"wontfix","color":"ffffff","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":24,"created_at":"2014-11-16T10:54:51Z","updated_at":"2016-08-02T14:17:18Z","closed_at":"2016-08-02T14:17:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"wish u addon Noto fonts to editor and support laravel syntax hints and highlights\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4200","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4200/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4200/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4200/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4200","id":48967723,"number":4200,"title":"Reload causes cursor/selection misalignment (for @font-face fonts)","user":{"login":"braver","id":2543659,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2543659?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/braver","html_url":"https://github.com/braver","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braver/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braver/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braver/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braver/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braver/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braver/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braver/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braver/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braver/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true},{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2014-11-16T10:29:57Z","updated_at":"2017-06-27T09:43:04Z","closed_at":"2017-06-27T09:43:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Possibly related to #3201, if you have fonts loaded through `@font-face` (e.g. using my fonts package), a reload causes the cursor/selection alignment to misbehave. Switching to the default font (i.e. empty the font family box in settings) restores it. You can then switch back to an `@font-face` font and it will work properly again.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n- Use an `@font-face` font as outlined here: https://discuss.atom.io/t/how-do-i-load-google-fonts-into-my-editors-styles/8321/7 (or by using http://atom.io/packages/fonts).\n- Put the name of the font in settings (e.g. 'aka-coder').\n- Open a file in Atom: all should look well in the new font.\n- Choose View > Reload.\n- Cursor and selection should now misalign. You can check this by double-click-selecting a word or by typing a row of characters.\n- Switch to settings.\n- Empty the font-family setting.\n- Switch to the file and all should look well again in the default font.\n- Switch to settings. \n- Put the name of the font in settings (e.g. 'aka-coder').\n- Switch to the file and all should look well again in aka-coder.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4199","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4199/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4199/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4199/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4199","id":48957979,"number":4199,"title":"Bug when starting editor under certain conditions","user":{"login":"ericwhyne","id":3034741,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3034741?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericwhyne","html_url":"https://github.com/ericwhyne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericwhyne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericwhyne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericwhyne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericwhyne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericwhyne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericwhyne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericwhyne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericwhyne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericwhyne/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"kevinsawicki","id":671378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/671378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinsawicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"assignees":[{"login":"kevinsawicki","id":671378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/671378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinsawicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true}],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2014-11-16T07:34:04Z","updated_at":"2015-01-16T17:59:41Z","closed_at":"2015-01-16T17:47:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When I closed the editor I had a file open in a tab.

I copied the answer to here for your convenience:\n\n\"-r sets the resources path, which is normally Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app. Your working copy is your local copy of the atom repository. So if you cloned to /Users/yjw9012/github/atom you would run:\natom -r /Users/yjw9012/github/atom\nThen instead of loading the code bundled in Atom.app, it will load the code you're working on.\nAlso, looking at the source, dev mode will load from ~/github/atom it exists. So if you have your copy stored there, you can just run atom -d.\"\n\nI was curious if there was a much faster way to see your code changes to the source code than rebuilding it by executing 'script/build'. It's true that building Atom takes a very few minutes (probably, less than 2 minutes), but I believe that some people might consider it's even too long.\n\nMy suggestion would be that we need to modify the answer above a little bit and put that in the build instruction for OS X(https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/docs/build-instructions/os-x.md) or other contribution guide pages at least. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4766","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"804E:3670:A0A740:19DF94B:59D92CAD","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=387>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=385>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"28f685f20c983eff64c3fae921138529\"","status":"200 OK"}}
