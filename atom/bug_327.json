I'll summarize the essence that relates to Atom, right here. Consider this snippet of Python:\n\n``` python\ndef maps():\n    print \"maps maps maps\"\n\ndef spam():\n    print \"Erasing everything...\"\n    print \"done.\"\n\ns = \"spam‮\" ,spam ,\"‬spam\"\n# ^ attention to this line: try selecting it with your mouse\ns[1]()\n```\n\nThat line, properly escaped:\n\n``` python\ns = \"spam&#8238;\" ,spam ,\"&#8236;spam\"\n```\n\nThe symbols of interest, in order of appearance, are `&#8238;` or RLO (right-to-left override) and `&#8236;` or PDF (pop directional formatting). They, respectively, reverse text direction and set it back.\n\nAtom expands this combination just like a browser would, it actually displays that RLO-PDF piece in reverse. However, interaction with it is... awkward. Start with the fact that you can't (at least visually) move your cursor inside that gap in any way.\n\nLook at this. With \"Plain text\" grammar on, I've selected that line:\n\n![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/q6KKB0M.png)\n\nNoticed that? 10 units of extra space. Notice also, that between RLO and PDF are exactly 10 characters. That's a hint. However, once I switch on Python grammar (and RLO-PDF interval is now contained in multiple elements), things get even more awkward.\n\n![Screenshot 2](http://i.imgur.com/QpOpCDm.png)\n\nNot 10 units, as before. Now we have only 4. And from that moment, I don't have a slightest clue about what's going on, but something needs to be done about that.\n\nThis needs a discussion. I can immediately come up with these two general directions:\n1. Interpret as designed in Unicode. Fix the UI, make the cursor work properly and not introduce gaps like the ones above.\n2. Represent Unicode control characters with some sort of \"placeholders\" and don't let them act as designed in Unicode.\n\nPersonally, I stand for placeholders, as Atom is mostly a code editor, and code is a raw sequence of characters. It makes sense for Atom to display it as closely as possible to how the parser will see it.\n\nIn those cases when plain text is used to author a document that makes use of these sequences to display properly, \"preview\" plugins come into play and let you preview the document as it will look after processing.\n\nThoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5989","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5989/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5989/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5989/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5989","id":62203877,"number":5989,"title":"Clipboard

Unfortunately I can't use package-cop because it doesn't work in safe mode.\n\nI went to the settings page to disable packages.  There were two problems ...\n\n1) When I scroll down, go into settings for a package, I can't go back, can I?.  I have to click on packages again and start at the top.  This is a serious problem when you have 100 packages.\n\n2) All enabled packages show the `Install` button which makes no sense.

Rather than calling a JavaScript method to register an element, you instead use a custom `<polymer-element>` tag to declare elements. The Polymer team had difficulty using this approach in Atom for a couple of reasons.\n### Issues running inline scripts due to our content-security policy\n\nThis is the biggest hurdle. There's currently no way to white-list script tags in an imported HTML document. A content security policy can be associated with a nonce value that can be inserted into scripts to indicate they are runnable, and it would be nice if we could cascade this nonce through an HTML import to script tags in the imported content.\n### Needing to manually insert HTML-imports into the `<head>`\n\nThis is easily solvable via a service that presents a function like `loadHTMLDocument(fullPath)`. I'd rather do it with `require`, but Node-style requires are expected to be synchronous and waiting for the imported content to load is async. This would therefore still require a tiny bit of boilerplate in `activate` to interact with the service and load the package's main document.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5986/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5985","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5985/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5985/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5985/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5985","id":62169714,"number":5985,"title":"Keyboard

discovered this issue with [atom-terminal](https://github.com/karan/atom-terminal) package. When package option (args, for example) is empty, then in config.cson we see no \"args\" parameter. After atom restart we will not see \"Args\" parameter at all. If whe write something like \"foo\" for this parameter, then line \"args: 'foo'\" appears in config.cson. So, I think it's about dealing with empty parameters or something like this.\nSo, before:\n![screenshot - 16 03 2015 - 14 21 10](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2385765/6665254/4a82744c-cbe8-11e4-8e5b-2c73e69543a0.png)\n![screenshot - 16 03 2015 - 14 22 05](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2385765/6665253/4a812902-cbe8-11e4-8546-df85825a0b18.png)\nAfter:\n![screenshot - 16 03 2015 - 14 22 42](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2385765/6665255/4a861ec6-cbe8-11e4-8ab5-3846273e9843.png)\n![screenshot - 16 03 2015 - 14 24 03](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2385765/6665257/4a88e2a0-cbe8-11e4-98b1-ad4e59809aa6.png)\nAfter restart:\n![screenshot - 16 03 2015 - 14 25 00](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2385765/6665256/4a879d14-cbe8-11e4-9d16-42f0d28cfa90.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5979","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5979/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5979/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5979/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5979","id":62034519,"number":5979,"title":"Uncaught Error: Cannot find module 'dialog'Error: Cannot find module 'dialog'    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:351:15)    at Function.Module._load (module.js:293:25)    at Module.require (module.js:380:17)    at EventEmitter.<anonymous> (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/atom/browser/lib/rpc-server.js:128:79)    at EventEmitter.emit (events.js:119:17)    at EventEmitter.<anonymous> (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/atom/browser/api/lib/web-contents.js:99:23)    at EventEmitter.emit (events.js:119:17)","user":{"login":"s-wirth","id":8342021,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/8342021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-wirth","html_url":"https://github.com/s-wirth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-wirth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-wirth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-wirth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-wirth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-wirth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-wirth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-wirth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-wirth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-wirth/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-03-16T10:15:51Z","updated_at":"2015-03-16T12:38:43Z","closed_at":"2015-03-16T12:38:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[Enter steps to reproduce below:]\n1.

based on their direction - like this:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/103348/6656258/15b2e4dc-cb24-11e4-9617-a81e7ba765dc.png)\n\nWhy this is better: because, regardless of whether the cursor is over an opening or closing brace, it's matched in such a way that you're typing _outside_ the matching parens - consistently.\n\nThe way it works in ATOM currently, if I start typing in the first example, I'm typing on the outside of the matched parens - but if I start typing in the second example, I'm typing inside the matched parens. \n\nHaving to cursor right before you start typing after a closing brace, and then having the \"wrong\" parens highlight when you do, is really confusing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5973/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5972","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5972/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5972/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5972/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5972","id":61798319,"number":5972,"title":"Use
