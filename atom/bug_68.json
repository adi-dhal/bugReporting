Description of the Change\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the feature requested in issue #12376. It adds a method to the parameter of the `::onWillDestroyPaneItem` callback named `prevent` which allows packages to prevent a tab from closing by adding an event listener via `::onWillDestroyPaneItem`\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nAn alternative for the requested feature overall isn't really present, as the previous implementation would close the tab no matter what or request the user to safe in case of unsaved changes. Both of these are unwanted behaviour as described in #12376.\r\n\r\nAs for alternative ways to implement the functionality, I considered `prevent` to be a (boolean) value instead of a function. However, this seemed not such a good choice mainly because I find it more intuitive to use as a function, but also because JavaScript can't enforce the value to be a boolean.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nAs explained in #12376, the problem is that it isn't part of the core. As of now it is nearly impossible to implement this as a package, and non of the solutions I could think of are even remotely elegant (e.g. recording what tab(s) closed and reopening them after they've been closed).\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nIt will help developers of packages prevent the unwanted closing of \"special\" tabs e.g. when \"Close all tabs\" is called by the user. This has, for example, been requested in [this](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/pinned-tabs-for-atom/issues/20) issue on one of my own packages.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nWhen used incorrectly this functionality could make closing tabs impossible for users. However, simply disabling the package that uses this functionality incorrectly will solve the problem.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nN/A","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13812/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13811","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13811/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13811/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13811/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13811","id":207426373,"number":13811,"title":"Atom crashes on Linux: [26686:0214/075533:INFO:CONSOLE(61)] \"Error: Could not create an input method.","user":{"login":"ik5","id":73091,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/73091?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ik5","html_url":"https://github.com/ik5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ik5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ik5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ik5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ik5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ik5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ik5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ik5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ik5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ik5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-02-14T06:05:26Z","updated_at":"2017-02-14T16:08:57Z","closed_at":"2017-02-14T06:28:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

But it's not an installer for Atom. It's an installer for the Installer ! After installation, you don't have Atom in c:\\Programs but an Installer of Atom and atom.exe still lives in personnal directory\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\ninstall with msiexec \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** \r\n\r\nhaving atom.exe living in c:\\Programs\\atom\\\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** \r\n\r\nAn atom installer lives in C:\\Programs and atom.exe lives in user personnal directory. Why is it so crucial for us ?  We are a high shcool and we teach code to our students. We have 1200 students and are low on budget for server storage space. \r\n\r\nEvery student has an allocation of approximately 300M for personnal space, and another 200M for sharing space. That's all we can do.\r\n\r\nAnd... atom installation is more than 300M in size ! It's useless because those 300M could perfectly be stored in C:\\Program\\atom\\ and shared for all the users of the computer.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** \r\n\r\n100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n1.14.1 on windows 7 64bits\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI've made some test so far, with copying brutally the content of a personnal atom setup in the system Programs directory, it seems to work for non priviledged users. The program files should live in system, and only customization should live in personnal data\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13789/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13788","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13788/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13788/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13788/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13788","id":206831706,"number":13788,"title":"Linux 32bit Source Build Fails Installation","user":{"login":"progkix","id":719946,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/719946?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/progkix","html_url":"https://github.com/progkix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/progkix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/progkix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/progkix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/progkix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/progkix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/progkix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/progkix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/progkix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/progkix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98407029,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/build-error","name":"build-error","color":"f7c6c7","default":false},{"id":97577987,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/linux","name":"linux","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2017-02-10T15:53:42Z","updated_at":"2017-03-02T21:51:02Z","closed_at":"2017-03-02T21:51:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I've just built 1.14.0 & 1.15.0-beta0 32bit Linux DEBs, RPMs and GZs on Fedora 25.
