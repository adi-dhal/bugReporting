Description\n\nOn MacOS 10.11.6 Atom 1.10.2 (even in safe mode) the \"home\" and \"end\" keys on my extended keyboard don't do the right thing. \"home\" moves to the start of the line and \"end\" moves to the end of line.\n\nThe key resolver shows that this is caused by:\n\n```\n\"atom-text-editor\": {\n    \"home\": \"editor:move-to-first-character-of-line\",\n    \"end\": \"editor:move-to-end-of-screen-line\",\n    \"shift-home\": \"editor:select-to-first-character-of-line\",\n    \"shift-end\": \"editor:select-to-end-of-line\"\n  },\n```\n\nin `/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/keymaps/base.json`\n\nBindings for what appear to be more traditional behavior, e.g. `core:move-to-top` for `home`, are also present in /Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/node_modules/tree-view/keymaps/e-view.json` but are being overridden by the above.\n\nI realize I can work around this, but it seems to me that the default ought to be

encountering a strange problem whilst running package specs in Atom: the scope descriptors I get from the specs don't seem to be the same as those in the actual editor. I may very well be doing something wrong here, so feel free to stop me if I am.\n\nI have the following simple PHP code:\n\n``` php\n<?php\n\n$test = \\Test\\CONST_TEST;\n```\n\nPutting this into an editor, the `\\Test\\` part of the scope descriptor has `.support.other.namespace.php` in its scope chain according to the developer tools. I can verify this via my package:\n\n``` coffeescript\neditor.scopeDescriptorForBufferPosition([2, 10]).getScopeChain()\n```\n\nThis yields `.text.html.php .meta.embedded.block.php .source.php .support.other.namespace.php`, which is correct. However, if I put this into my spec:\n\n``` coffeescript\ndescribe \"Test\", ->\n    editor = null\n    grammar = null\n\n    beforeEach ->\n        waitsForPromise ->\n            atom.workspace.open().then (result) ->\n                editor = result\n\n        waitsForPromise ->\n            atom.packages.activatePackage('language-php')\n\n        runs ->\n            grammar = atom.grammars.selectGrammar('.text.html.php')\n\n        waitsFor ->\n            grammar and editor\n\n        runs ->\n            editor.setGrammar(grammar)\n\n    it \"gives different results from an actual Atom window?\", ->\n        source =\n            \"\"\"\n            <?php\n\n            $test = \\Test\\CONST_TEST;\n            \"\"\"\n\n        editor.setText(source)\n\n        lines = editor.getLineCount()\n\n        for line in [0 .. lines - 1]\n            text = editor.lineTextForBufferRow(line)\n\n            continue if text.length == 0\n\n            for i in [0 .. text.length - 1]\n                chain = editor.scopeDescriptorForBufferPosition([line, i]).getScopeChain()\n\n                console.log([line, i], chain)\n```\n\nThe entire range `\\Test\\CONST_TEST` is marked as being a `.text.html.php .meta.embedded.block.php .source.php .constant.other.php`, which is something slightly different from what the editor says. What's strange is that it seems that actual syntax highlighting has occurred, as scope descriptors are present, but only _some_ of them are different from the actual results. Am I perhaps somehow using the wrong grammar?\n\nMy apologies if this is in the wrong place, the issue is somewhat tied to the `language-php` package, but since it involves difference in behavior between specs and the actual editors, I thought it might belong here instead.\n\nI'm using Atom version 1.10.2.\n\nThanks in advance\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12874/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12873","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12873/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12873/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12873/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12873","id":180933931,"number":12873,"title":"Uncaught Error: Cannot read property 'object' of undefinedTypeError: Cannot read property 'objec...","user":{"login":"cofauver","id":6520345,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6520345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cofauver","html_url":"https://github.com/cofauver","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cofauver/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cofauver/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cofauver/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cofauver/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cofauver/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cofauver/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cofauver/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cofauver/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cofauver/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-10-04T15:56:16Z","updated_at":"2016-10-04T16:02:27Z","closed_at":"2016-10-04T16:02:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[Enter steps to reproduce below:]\n1.

When working with `--wait` the file is usually a temporary file, so there is no opportunity to restore the work later.\n\nThe `--wait` option should introduce prompt-for-save-on-close behavior.

If the cursor is in the right place, the code-hint overlay gives the appearance of jumping as the user moves through the list of code-hint suggestions with arrow keys.  When the overlay moves with each up/down arrow key it's more than annoying.\n\nThe overlay probably needs to determine its position based on the items in the list, instead of basing its position on the currently selected item in the suggestion list.\n\n[Description of the bug or feature]\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nubuntu 16.04\n1. position cursor in a file as in screenshot\n2. start typing a new line of css and press ctrl-space for code hints\n3. use up/down arrow keys to scroll through list of code suggestions.  Watch overlay jump around.\n\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expected to happen]\nOverlay appears, then stays in the same place as the user scrolls through the list with up/down arrow keys.\n\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\nOverlay appears, then moves around the screen as the user scrolls through the list with up/down arrow keys.\n\n![screenshot from 2016-10-03
