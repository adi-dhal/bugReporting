Requirements\r\n\r\n* Filling out the template is required. Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.\r\n* All new code requires tests to ensure against regressions\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nWe must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the Dockerfile base image to node:6 which is the current LTS version of node. Following the build instructions in the documentation for linux, the image will be built with alle the requirements for building atom. At the same time, I added a little documentation for how to build and use the image.\r\n\r\nDifference from the original Dockerfile image is the ADD and WORKDIR instructions in it, I decided to remove this and instead instruct to mount atom in the docker run command as the filesystem can change. \r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain what other alternates were considered and why the proposed version was selected -->\r\n\r\n1. One might consider adding ADD and WORKDIR instructions back to Dockerfile.\r\n2. #14225 only fixes the current failures with the current docker setup, and can be considered an alternative to this PR.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain why this functionality should be in atom/atom as opposed to a package -->\r\n\r\nBecause it expands on features in core.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\n<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->\r\n\r\nDocker makes it easy to build atom on any system that have Docker installed, without the need to handle dependencies for atom itself.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\n<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->\r\n\r\nI'm not sure, as I do not know to what extent the Dockerfile is used in core or what purpose it had originally.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\n<!-- Enter any applicable Issues here -->\r\n\r\nFixes #14394 \r\nFixes #14224\r\nCloses

The new implementation differs from the old one in several major ways:\r\n\r\n* The class is now implemented primarily in C++, as part of our native library [superstring](https://github.com/atom/superstring).\r\n* Instead of storing the text as a mutable array of lines, we store it as flat immutable string representing the file's original content, plus a *Patch* representing the user's unsaved changes. This is somewhat similar to the [piece table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piece_table) data structure used in some other editors.\r\n* At the native level, the buffer supports *snapshots* - read-only views of the buffer that can be processed in background threads with no copying or locking, even while the buffer is being mutated on the main thread.\r\n* File I/O and transcoding is now handled by the native library, entirely on background threads and exposed via promises.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nFor many purposes, the existing array-of-lines implementation was actually very fast; we've never observed slowness associated with the querying or mutating of the text itself. This is a testament to V8's highly efficient String operations. However, there are many operations in Atom that *use* the `TextBuffer` and would benefit from being dropped to C++ and/or being moved to a background thread.\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of this that have already been addressed in this PR:\r\n\r\n* Previously, saving and loading a `TextBuffer` required its entire contents to be represented as a single JavaScript String. V8 has a hard limit on string length, so this would cause errors (#7210). Now, saving and loading are done in a background thread in C++, with minimal copying of data.\r\n* When the file associated with an unmodified `TextBuffer` changes on disk, we diff the file's new contents with the buffer's contents in order to update the buffer in a way that preserves marker positions. Previously, this diff computation caused unresponsiveness in large files (atom/text-buffer#153). Now the diff is performed in C++ and on a background thread.\r\n* Whenever the application is idle, we serialize the state of the window and persist it, so that we can restore it even if Atom crashes or power is lost. Previously, persisting a large file's text would cause hangs, so we had to disable this safety feature for large files (#13583). Now, because of our new representation of the buffer, we are able to efficiently serialize *just* the outstanding changes, so we can re-enable the feature for arbitrarily large files.\r\n* The [line-ending-selector](https://github.com/atom/line-ending-selector) needs to detect what type of line endings a `TextBuffer` uses. Because we support files with *mixed* line endings, this entails scanning the entire buffer. Previously, this would take upwards of 50ms for a large file. Now, the search is performed asynchronously so that it causes no noticeable lag.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these improvements, this PR will make it very easy to optimize other features. Here are some follow-up PRs that I have in mind:\r\n* When changing a large amount of text at once, indexing the new text in the `DisplayLayer` takes a long time. This is one of the main reasons that pasting a huge amount of text is slow. Some of this character-by-character computation could probably be done much faster in C++.\r\n* Currently, using the [find-and-replace](https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace) package in a very large file can cause hangs when searches produce more than a hundred thousand results. We will now be able to run searches entirely in a background thread, eliminating any lag.\r\n* Populating the [autocomplete-plus](https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus) package's `SymbolStore` can take a very long time for large files, so we had to [disable it](https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus/pull/782) for large files. Fuzzy matching should be able to be performed in C++ on a background thread, eliminating this restriction.\r\n\r\n### Implementation details\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Our new representation of the buffer:</summary>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\nSuppose I create a `TextBuffer` with some initial text and then make three edits:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst buffer = new TextBuffer('abc\\ndefg\\nhijkl')\r\nbuffer.setTextInRange([[0, 2], [0, 3]], \"C\")\r\nbuffer.setTextInRange([[2, 0], [2, 1]], \"H\")\r\nbuffer.setTextInRange([[1, 1], [1, 2]], \"E\")\r\nassert.equal(buffer.getText(), 'abC\\ndEfg\\nHijkl')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis buffer is now represented internally like this:\r\n\r\n![graph-1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/326587/26644547/f3bbc95a-45e9-11e7-91a4-ceee77e90ecc.png)\r\n\r\nThe buffer is composed of two *layers*. The first layer stores the buffer's initial text as a flat, immutable string. This makes freshly-opened files very compact in memory. The second layer stores the unsaved edits in an object that we call a `Patch`. The `Patch` is structured as a [splay tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splay_tree) so that mutations and queries are very efficient, especially in areas that have recently been accessed.\r\n\r\nThen, suppose I begin some asynchronous operation like saving the buffer to disk, or searching \r\nthe buffer for a regex. Then, *while* that operation is still happening, I make some *additional* edits:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst savePromise = buffer.save()\r\nbuffer.setTextInRange([[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'A')\r\nbuffer.setTextInRange([[2, 4], [2, 5]], 'L')\r\nassert.equal(buffer.getText(), 'AbC\\ndEfg\\nHijkL')\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt that point, the buffer's internal state would look like this:\r\n\r\n![graph2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/326587/26644968/63dd6562-45eb-11e7-9d66-9dfe94d243d9.png)\r\n\r\nThere are now *three* layers. Because the asynchronous `save` is still in progress, further changes that we make to the buffer are saved in a *new* Patch. When the `save` completes, we flatten the text down into one layer again.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### Effect on packages\r\n\r\nI don't believe making `save` async has affected any of our bundled packages' functionality, though it has caused some test failures that I've had to fix:\r\n* [x] https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus/pull/852\r\n* [x]
