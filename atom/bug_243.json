version: 1.0.7\nOS: Windows 7 Home Premium x64\nBehaviour: Never seen before atom.\nPackages: [editorconfig](https://github.com/sindresorhus/atom-editorconfig) and an [Arma language package](https://github.com/acemod/language-arma-atom)\n\nFirst of all, I apologise that I can't provide any more information right now. All of my evidence is circumstantial.\n\nSince switching to atom I've started experiencing seemingly random \"crashes\" where all of my programs stop responding (including explorer) and I can't open the task manager or even use ctrl+alt+delete. The only fix I've found for this is a hard reset.\n\nSteps I've taken to find out what's causing this:\n- Booted in safe mode and ran a scan with MSE and Malwarebytes. Nothing found.\n- Ran a disk check. Reports no issues.\n- Ran a memory diagnostic. Reports no issues.\n- Checked event viewer for any problems.\n\nI'm not the best at debugging issues on this scale (at this point, I actually experienced another of these crashes while typing this - thankfully chrome remembered this post) but I believe these are in some way related to atom as:\n- They only ever seem to happen while or shortly after it has been open.\n- They only started happening since I started using it.\n- One time I had the task manager open beforehand and saw many instances of the following processes running (which I believe are atom related):\n  - cmd.exe *32\n  - node.exe *32\n  - conhost.exe\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/A9wZeln.png) Here is a print screen I managed to save from the crash I experienced while typing this (one of my programs remained open and thank god it could upload images).\n\nDoes it seem like this is caused by atom or am I looking in the wrong place? Also are there any debugging steps I can make to get more information from atom that might pertain to this issue?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8523/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8522","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8522/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8522/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8522/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8522","id":103305787,"number":8522,"title":"\"Replace

This is clearly wrong and, although this seemed to have no effect performance-wise, @nathansobo found it had an impact while benchmarking stuff with `chrome://tracing`.\n\nTo fix this, I have introduced a `state.content.maxHeight` that's calculated using `TextEditorElement`'s bounding client rect and that gets updated every time its dimensions change.\n\nSorry about this but hopefully we

I'm really glad I switched from Netbeans to Atom and I love many things about it.

I think the results screen shouldn't be a normal tab because sometimes it's harder to find it when many taps are open!\n   I think It's better to have a results as a panel instead of a normal tab \n2. I should be able to have multiple search\\replace instances without having to reuse the same instance! sometimes you want to search for multiple keywords and currently I'm only able to have one search instance at a time\n3. When replacing, it's VERY important to be able to select or filter out some results. It really sucks when I want to replace 99 results from 100 and I cancel the whole thing just for one result I want to skip!\n\nThat's my basic thoughts and after discussing we can find a more specific features and I can then split them into different features or tickets\nNow I really have to go back to work :D \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8516","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8516/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8516/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8516/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8516","id":103226994,"number":8516,"title":"Uncaught Error: EACCES: permission denied, open '/Resources/translations/messages.en.yml'","user":{"login":"lales12","id":4629235,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4629235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lales12","html_url":"https://github.com/lales12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lales12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lales12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lales12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lales12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lales12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lales12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lales12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lales12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lales12/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":601496052,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e6e6e6","default":false},{"id":211058624,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/uncaught-exception","name":"uncaught-exception","color":"e11d21","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-08-26T09:53:17Z","updated_at":"2017-09-10T11:43:08Z","closed_at":"2017-09-10T11:43:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[Enter steps to reproduce below:]\n1.
