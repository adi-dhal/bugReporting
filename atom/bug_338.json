doc in Atom. Then I was surprising that there's no match. Because you cannot see the trailing carriage return in any form on the editor, you may not aware the fact that you are actually searching a 2-lines text.\n\nThe search input box seems to be a single-line one, so I guess we may need to trim CRs and LFs there.\n\nAtom Version `0.181.0 2015/2/19 上午5:56:33`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5644/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5643","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5643/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5643/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5643/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5643","id":58254696,"number":5643,"title":"Report deprecations from tasks","user":{"login":"kevinsawicki","id":671378,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/671378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinsawicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinsawicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-02-19T19:17:55Z","updated_at":"2015-02-20T00:41:34Z","closed_at":"2015-02-19T23:14:35Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/5643","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5643","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5643.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5643.patch"},"body":"Setup Grim in the task process and report back deprecations to the app.\n\n![screen shot 2015-02-19 at 11 17 02 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/671378/6274017/f269b7ca-b828-11e4-9e8a-c90825c505a0.png)\n\nCloses #5525 \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5643/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5642","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5642/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5642/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5642/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5642","id":58250107,"number":5642,"title":"Copy paste of text aligned with spaces (e.g. asterisk-aligned PHPDoc) sometimes loses the alignment with soft tabs off","user":{"login":"driskell","id":939815,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/939815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/driskell","html_url":"https://github.com/driskell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driskell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driskell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driskell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driskell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driskell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driskell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driskell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driskell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driskell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-02-19T18:42:13Z","updated_at":"2015-06-30T00:21:17Z","closed_at":"2015-06-30T00:21:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Easiest to reproduce with PHP grammar, and the \"doc_f\" snippet.
