Manually installing the packages libasound2 and libxkbfile1 fixes the problem. So these dependencies seem to be missing in the debian package.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Get a minimal installation of Ubuntu 16.04\r\n2. `sudo apt-get update`\r\n4. `wget https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/download/v1.13.0/atom-amd64.deb`\r\n5. `sudo apt-get install ./atom-amd64.deb`\r\n6. `atom`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nAtom should start up.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\nThe following error message is printed in the console\r\n```\r\n/usr/share/atom/atom: error while loading shared libraries: libasound.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\r\n```\r\nAfter having executed `sudo apt-get install libasound2`, running `atom` results in an almost empty window with the Chrome debugging tools being shown. On the Console tab, a stack trace is shown starting with the following line:\r\n```\r\nError: libxkbfile.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\r\n```\r\nAfter having executed `sudo apt-get install libxkbfile1`, atom starts up normally.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:**\r\n1/1\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n```\r\natom --version\r\nAtom    : 1.13.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n```\r\n```\r\napm --version\r\napm  1.14.1\r\nnpm  3.10.5\r\nnode 4.4.5\r\npython 2.7.12\r\ngit 2.7.4\r\n```\r\n```\r\nlsb_release -a\r\nNo LSB modules are available.\r\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\r\nDescription:    Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS\r\nRelease:        16.04\r\nCodename:       xenial\r\n```\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13591/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13590","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13590/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13590/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13590/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13590","id":200096922,"number":13590,"title":"Curly bracket mismatch in JavaScript","user":{"login":"josephrocca","id":1167575,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1167575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephrocca","html_url":"https://github.com/josephrocca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephrocca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephrocca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephrocca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephrocca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephrocca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephrocca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephrocca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephrocca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephrocca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-01-11T13:44:37Z","updated_at":"2017-01-11T17:21:11Z","closed_at":"2017-01-11T17:21:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sorry for the lack of extended testing.

I have multiple projects added to the Tree View. A couple of them use the same final folder name (e.g. `C:\\path\\to\\www` and `C:\\another\\path\\www`). Furthermore, these are similar websites with similar directory structures. For example, I work on multiple WordPress sites that share some plugins in common.\r\n\r\nWhen I use the \"Search in Directory\" function I get a path that looks like this: `www\\public_html\\wp-content\\plugins\\woocommerce`. However, since that path could be referring to multiple projects, I get duplicate search results.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Add multiple projects to the Tree View with the same name for the final directory\r\n2. Search inside one of the projects for a string that would occur in the same place in more than one project\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Return only the results from the project you selected to search within.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Results from multiple projects are returned.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nWindows 10 1607\r\nAtom    : 1.12.9\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI know it seems like kind of a corner case, but I can't tell you how frustrating it is to find a file, start editing it, and then try to understand why your changes aren't being reflected. Only later do you realize that you've been editing code for a completely different project. :)\r\n\r\nThanks for the great editor, btw.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13577/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4156","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507404130","x-github-request-id":"899F:366D:348A65:771098:59D9282C","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=76>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=74>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"bcfb5400ad521686b3ec03bfe3af2f21\"","status":"200 OK"}}
