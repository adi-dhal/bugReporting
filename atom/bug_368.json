In my opinion, this is bad behavior because it is confusing and potentially problematic to save something that differs from what has been edited.\n\nAs one example, if I am editing a file in an existing repo, I don't want to automatically insert a newline because the resulting diff will distract from what I'm trying to do.\n\nIn addition, it's not just that this happens silently, it's that I can't find any way to end a file without a newline. Let me edit my files! =)\n\nI couldn't find a setting for this, although I may be missing something. In my opinion this should not be default behavior in any case.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4741/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4740","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4740/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4740/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4740/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4740","id":52661171,"number":4740,"title":"Fn + Delete on Mac (delete forwards) doesn’t work in Dvorak – Qwerty ⌘","user":{"login":"dangodev","id":1369770,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1369770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dangodev","html_url":"https://github.com/dangodev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dangodev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dangodev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dangodev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dangodev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dangodev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dangodev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dangodev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dangodev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dangodev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"nathansobo","id":1789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo","html_url":"https://github.com/nathansobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"assignees":[{"login":"nathansobo","id":1789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo","html_url":"https://github.com/nathansobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true}],"milestone":null,"comments":12,"created_at":"2014-12-22T15:51:23Z","updated_at":"2015-02-27T17:14:45Z","closed_at":"2015-02-27T17:11:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"`Delete` works fine; `Fn + Delete` yields no behavior whatsoever.

When the selection takes up more than one line, `ctrl-shift-d` duplicates text down\n\nRight now you have `editor.duplicateLines()` to accomplish 2.  But, I would like to add support for 1.  I added a function `editor.duplicateSelections()` instead of adding to the current function because I wanted to get feedback and get something working.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4733/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4732","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4732/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4732/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/4732/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4732","id":52618484,"number":4732,"title":"Rendering artifacts on scrollbars","user":{"login":"Wardrop","id":201442,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/201442?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wardrop","html_url":"https://github.com/Wardrop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wardrop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wardrop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wardrop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wardrop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wardrop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wardrop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wardrop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wardrop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wardrop/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-12-22T04:10:34Z","updated_at":"2014-12-22T05:24:42Z","closed_at":"2014-12-22T05:24:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When hardware acceleration is enabled (OS X 10.10.1, Atom 0.165.0), rendering artifacts occur when text clips behind the vertical scrollbar in the file pane.
