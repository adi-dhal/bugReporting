But in the interest of getting to the API freeze faster, I think we should avoid pulling a complex framework into core at this time. This PR focuses on simplifying and clarifying the events API without introducing observables, but the proposed changes are compatible with adding RxJS observables in the future.\n\nThe goal of this PR is to reform all the event APIs to use methods instead of strings for all the objects involved in everything in workspace.\n## Tasks\n- [x] Add New APIs\n  - [x] Workspace\n    - [x] Pane\n    - [x] PaneAxis\n    - [x] PaneContainer\n- [x] Document New APIs\n- [x] Deprecate Old APIs\n  - [x] Deprecate theorist-dependent code paths\n  - [x] Deprecate direct calls to `::on`\n  - [x] Deprecate supplanted methods\n## API Conventions\n- All event subscriptions should occur through explicit methods rather than through strings passed to `::on`.\n- Event subscription methods take callbacks as their final argument. In the future, we can add the ability to return an observable when no callback is provided.\n- Event subscription methods return _disposables_. When you call `.dispose()` on the returned disposable the subscription is cancelled.\n- Event callbacks are always invoked with a single object. If multiple pieces of information need to be passed, the object can be a hash with named entries.\n- Event subscription methods conform to the following naming conventions:\n  - Discrete events are named with `onDid[Verb][Noun]` or `onWill[Verb][Noun]`:\n    - `onDidActivate`\n    - `onDidAddItem`\n    - `onWillDestroyItem`\n  - Properties that change can have two kinds of methods:\n    - Methods that invoke the callback the next time the property _changes_ take the form `onDidChange[PropertyName]`:\n      - `onDidChangeActiveItem`\n    - Methods that invoke the callback immediately with the current value and also whenever it changes take the form `observe[PropertyName]`:\n      - `observeActiveItem`\n  - Collections can be observed with `observe[CollectionName]`, which will invoke the callback with all current and future elements:\n    - `observePanes`\n## Usage Guidelines\n\nI've created a simple npm called [event-kit](https://github.com/atom/event-kit). The goal is to provide a few building blocks for implementing and consuming evented APIs while maintaining maximal simplicity.\n### Implementing Evented APIs\n\nWe want to move away from mixins and toward composition. Toward that end, `event-kit` exports a simple `Emitter` object that can be used to streamline evented APIs. Rather than mixing it in, you construct an `Emitter` instance and use it internally. Here's a sample of how you use it:\n\n``` coffee\n{Emitter} = require 'event-kit'\n\nclass Pane\n  constructor: ->\n    # implementation...\n    @emitter = new Emitter\n\n  onDidChangeActiveItem: (fn) ->\n    @emitter.on 'did-change-active-item', fn\n\n  setActiveItem: (activeItem) ->\n    unless activeItem is @activeItem\n      @activeItem = activeItem\n      @emitter.emit 'did-change-active-item', activeItem\n    @activeItem\n```\n\nThis is similar to the existing emitter from emissary, but it's maximally simple and omits several features such as namespaces and support for multiple event arguments. The `::on` method also returns `Disposable` instances which unsubscribe when `.dispose()` is called on them.\n\nUsing emitters via _instances_ instead of mixins ensures users won't call `::on` directly and gives us leverage for deprecating existing direct usages of `::on`.\n\nIf needed, `Disposable` can be used directly. You build a disposable with a function that is called when the disposable is disposed. This intentionally follows the same API as RxJS.\n\n``` coffee\n{Disposable} = require 'event-kit'\n\ndisposable = new Disposable(=> @cleanUp())\n```\n### Consuming Evented APIs\n\nWe want to encourage users to dispose of subscriptions when they are done with them, and we now think the best way to do this is to make it _explicit_. So now rather than using the `Subscriber` mixin, we will encourage users to build their own `CompositeDisposable` instance and add subscriptions to it.\n\n``` coffee\n{CompositeDisposable} = require 'event-kit'\n\nclass TabBar\n  constructor: (@pane) ->\n    @subscriptions = new CompositeDisposable\n    @subscriptions.add @pane.observeActiveItem -> # ...\n    @subscriptions.add @pane.onDidAddItem -> # ...\n    @subscriptions.add @pane.onDidRemoveItem -> # ...\n\n  destroyed: ->\n    @subscriptions.dispose()\n```\n\nUsers will need to remember to dispose of the subscriptions, but we think that making it more explicit will help clarify what is going on in examples and increase the likelihood that package authors clean up.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3418/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3417","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3417/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3417/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3417/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/3417","id":41423988,"number":3417,"title":"Show Tree View when opening a folder path","user":{"login":"robertmiles3","id":944302,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/944302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertmiles3","html_url":"https://github.com/robertmiles3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertmiles3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertmiles3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertmiles3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertmiles3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertmiles3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertmiles3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertmiles3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertmiles3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertmiles3/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2014-08-28T18:21:21Z","updated_at":"2014-08-28T21:03:22Z","closed_at":"2014-08-28T18:25:43Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/3417","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/3417","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/3417.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/3417.patch"},"body":"When opening a folder path, it seems logical that the tree view should always show since the usual next step would be to open a file within that folder.

Say for example (this is very basic canonical and not actually how ACL works by command):\n\n```\numask 077\nacl u+rwx,og-rwx\n~/dev acl u+rwx,og-rwx\n~/dev/* acl u+rwx,og+rx\n```\n\nOR\n\n```\njordon@envygeeks:~/development $ umask && getfacl .\n0077\nuser::rwx\ngroup::r-x\nother::r-x\ndefault:user::rwx\ndefault:group::r-x\ndefault:other::r-x\n\njordon@envygeeks:~/development $ touch hello && ls -l hello\n-rw-r--r-- 1 jordon jordon 0 Aug 28 12:11 hello\n```\n\nThis results in dev being unopenable by anybody but me but (because of ACL) but allows any file created within that folder to be readable by anybody so that there are no permissions problems when uploading files to servers, repos or other places.  Atom does not respect this and it always results in files being created with the `umask` and not `getfacl`'s mask.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3415","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3415/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3415/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3415/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3415","id":41414070,"number":3415,"title":"[Windows]

There is confusion around\n- Which classes produce which events?\n- What is the difference between events and commands?\n- What is a subscription object? \n- Subscribe? on? which one? Where am I? It's dark in here!\n\nThis guide (and new APIs!) should address these things.\n### Serialization\n- WTF is it?\n- How does it work?\n- How to use it?\n### Inter-package communication\n\n(API needs to be written!)\n- How to use\n- Best practices\n### Testing your package\n- Setting it up\n- Best practices\n### Grammar scopes\n\nCreating a language package? A syntax theme? It's impossible to know what scopes to generate / select for in common cases. What are the scopes for a function? Punctuation? Class names? I have no idea. Currently, the only way to know what to do is to look through several other lang packages and themes to get an idea of the scopes involved.\n### Decorations\n\nCurrently the best docs are the example package and the blog post.\n## List of cookbooks / recipes\n\nCookbooks / Recipes (have not decided on naming) are small snippets that solve a specific problem. Often package authors (and me!) want to know \"how do I do That Common Thing that I saw in package Y\". They can also be an entry point into a related guide. \n\nThis list should be exhaustive. If you have ideas, let me know and I will add them.\n- Observing all the editors\n- Observing the active editor / pane item\n- Adding a pane item in a tab (like settings view)\n- Adding a panel (like find and replace)\n- Subscribing to a command\n- Highlighting a line / gutter-number (decoration)\n- Adding something to the status bar\n- How to get user input (like jump to line)\n- How to display a filterable list in a dialog (like command palette)\n## Changes we should make to existing guides\n### In [Creating a package](https://atom.io/docs/latest/creating-a-package)\n- This could provide more of an overview and be the entry point / index into other guides (like the one on events or serialization).\n- Section about activation events\n## Less concrete ideas for guides\n\nHere are some ideas from https://github.com/atom/api/pull/6 and from the summit that are less fleshed out. \n- Making your package fast: common pitfalls\n- Debugging your package\n- Package manager guide\n- Theme manager\n- Syntax/Grammar\n- Editor\n- Workspace/Panes\n- apm\n- ~/.atom\n- cross-platform\n- dependency management in packages (where do I get the things I need?)\n## Updates\n\nWriting these is getting closer, so I will be updating the body of this issue as comments roll in and we think of things.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3399/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3398","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3398/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3398/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3398/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3398","id":41298327,"number":3398,"title":"Windows:

'application:show-settings'` exists in `win32.cson` and `darwin32.cson`, it makes sense to exist in `linux.cson` too.\n\nQuestion is how are the menu bars updated? \n\nIt updates fine if the above keybind is in the user's keymap.cson, but it doesn't update if it's in linux.cson. (done after rebuild/reinstall) \n\n**Unrelated to pull request**:\n\nSuggestion: `ctrl-alt-o` should be binded to `application:open-folder`. It's useful and many people will benefit from having this by default.\n\nDiscussion: however, _ctrl-alt_ doesn't make the most sense, _ctrl-shift_ does. As we (kind of) want to open multiple files (implicitly a folder) and that's usually what _shift_ key is related to. However, `'ctrl-shift-o': 'application:open-dev'` and `'ctrl-shift-i': 'window:toggle-dev-tools'` exist already. \n\nIf we really want to use `ctrl-shift-o` as open folder, it wouldn't make the most sense to have `ctrl-shift-i` as dev tools. We must change both _open-dev_ and _toggle-dev-tools_ to be combined with _alt_ instead of _shift_. What do you think of this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/3396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4740","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"DD18:366E:70CD4E:EDA26B:59D92D08","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=413>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=411>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"92f89292ee6790a9c266822f41f1a3d4\"","status":"200 OK"}}
