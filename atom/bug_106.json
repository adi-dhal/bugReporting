we (the Nuclide team) got bitten by what seems to be a bug in Atom's package manager when we switched from loading our \"sub-packages\" during Nuclide's activation phase to its loading phase.\n\nIt seems that, if you upgrade a package from within Atom, its new metadata (including the version) will be loaded immediately but `Package::load()` will still load the old version of the package ([because of the require cache](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/v1.11.0-beta5/src/package.coffee#L441)). It'll then use that code to determine whether requiring the main module can be deferred and cache that in local storage. The next time Atom's loaded, it uses the (potentially inaccurate) cached value.\n\nWe noticed this because our code changed from allowing the deferment of requiring the main module to not, but Atom continued to defer loading.\n\nRelated:\n- facebook/nuclide#698\n- facebook/nuclide#699\n- facebook/nuclide#700\n-

we used to run tests only on CircleCI which, despite providing a pretty extensive coverage for macOS, is insufficient to understand whether something has regressed on other platforms. The ideal solution to this problem would be to run tests on every operating system: our renderer test suite, however, is particularly flaky on Linux and Windows as, with time, it has evolved without multi-platform compatibility in mind.\n\nThis pull-request is a first step towards such solution: instead of using Travis and AppVeyor as build-only providers, we will now run main process tests on them. These kind of tests are more coarse-grained than the renderer process ones, but they provide quick feedback and should act as good smoke tests for when we release new versions. We could have used `chromedriver` as well, but it seems like it's quite flaky on both Windows and Linux, so I have put that on hold for the time being (in a later pull-request, it might be interesting to change our current `smoke-spec` to use [electron/spectron](https://github.com/electron/spectron) instead and see if that changes anything).\n\n/cc: @atom/core \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12646/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12645","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12645/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12645/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12645/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12645","id":175959437,"number":12645,"title":"Fix app not quitting on win32 and linux when closing the last window","user":{"login":"as-cii","id":482957,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/482957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii","html_url":"https://github.com/as-cii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/as-cii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-09-09T08:52:33Z","updated_at":"2016-09-09T15:57:57Z","closed_at":"2016-09-09T15:57:57Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/12645","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12645","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12645.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12645.patch"},"body":"This regression was caused by a nuance in the way we maintain state in `AtomApplication` for open windows. Specifically, when closing the last window on Windows and Linux, we were explicitly calling `app.quit` _before_ removing such window from the list of open ones. In turn, this caused the new `before-quit` behavior introduced in #12619 to work improperly because it made the application wait on saving the state of a stale window before exiting.\n\nWith this pull-request we are fixing that by making sure the stale window is removed before calling `app.quit` in `removeWindow`.\n\n/cc: @atom/core @damieng \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12645/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12644","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12644/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12644/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12644/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12644","id":175903806,"number":12644,"title":"how can i connect my github account in atom","user":{"login":"Kongdy","id":17754750,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/17754750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kongdy","html_url":"https://github.com/Kongdy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kongdy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kongdy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kongdy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kongdy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kongdy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kongdy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kongdy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kongdy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kongdy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":175213356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/question","name":"question","color":"ededed","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-09-09T01:17:16Z","updated_at":"2017-08-13T11:37:54Z","closed_at":"2016-09-09T03:38:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\n\nas the title say.\nhow can i set my github account in atom that i can commit my project easily.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.

The color fixes when the pane is updated by changing tabs. The screenshot below shows the muted color on the left, and the correct color (by changing the tab) on the right.\n\nThis does not appear to happen when waking the computer if atom is on the laptop screen. Its hard to tell, but the color appears to be fine for a split second, and then muted once the window is force-resized. This may happen on a desktop, but I don't have one to test with.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1187432/18359997/297866f2-75b1-11e6-898f-417644b42c35.png)\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open Atom on a second, external monitor on a macbook\n2. Allow Mac to lock from inactivity OR lock from the lock in the toolbar. The System \"Sleep\" command will not work.\n3. Wake the mac, and unlock the screen\n\n**Expected behavior:** Color should appear normally\n\n**Actual behavior:** Color is <s>muted</s> not sub-pixel rendered.
