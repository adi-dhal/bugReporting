I am in awe of the aesthetics of the Github client for Windows.

I can imagine both: Atom being just another module or \"page\" inside the github client, or the github client gets removed and all its functionality integrated into the Atom tree view, via context menu entries or a second tree view pane with repositories etc...\n\nHas any thought been given to this kind of thing?\nI'd love to see that, and given Atom's extensibility, I'm sure a package is just around the corner.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2545/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2544","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2544/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2544/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2544/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2544","id":35211678,"number":2544,"title":"JSON and Error 200","user":{"login":"ajtroxell","id":3221144,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3221144?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtroxell","html_url":"https://github.com/ajtroxell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtroxell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtroxell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtroxell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtroxell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtroxell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtroxell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtroxell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtroxell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtroxell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98407029,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/build-error","name":"build-error","color":"f7c6c7","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-06-07T16:09:33Z","updated_at":"2014-07-03T14:02:34Z","closed_at":"2014-06-17T12:34:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Here is the log when running script/build.\nNode.js, Python, and Visual Studio/Express installed.\n\nnpmC:\\atom [master]> script/build\nNode: v0.10.28\nPython: v2.7.7\nnpm ERR! registry error parsing json\nnpm ERR!

would like to raise the issue of configurable tab stops.\n\nA proposal has been floating around the web for a few years, called [Elastic tabstops](http://nickgravgaard.com/elastictabstops/), that promises to usher in the \"next generation\" of source code alignment.\n\nIt aims to make it easy to align code blocks and side comments, both for traditional coders using monospaced fonts, and for those of us who prefer proportional fonts.\n\nIt would also make it easy to edit tabular data, be it TSV (tab-separated values) or a table in Markdown or other markup languages.\n\nI would gladly write an extension myself to realize elastic tabstops, but unfortunately it's one of those things that require a very specific feature in the editor component: **the ability to specify non-uniform tab stops, as a list of visual positions (eg. pixel or em, _not_ characters) that may be different for each line.**\n\nRight now the tab support in Atom is just a trick (a span with a certain number of blank characters), it's not even a true tab stop, as is painfully evident when using a proportional font:\n\n![screen shot 2014-06-06 at 15 38

wanted to throw this feature request out there to the clever people writing such code.\n\nI'm fully aware that it is not a simple task, because it transcends the character-counting nature of the current code. Doing it without triggering a reflow for each tab stop (to query the current width of the line being composed) is even harder. It would require pre-caching the em-width of every character for the current font, or something along those lines.\n\nBut it's one of those features that would set Atom apart from any other editor.\n\nAgain, the tricky part is just the configurable tab stops. That would allow extension writers to align code, tables, and other data with various algorithms, including Elastic tabstops.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2532","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2532/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2532/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2532/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/2532","id":35142021,"number":2532,"title":"Adds

(removes the directory tree)\n/Q - obvious this is quite mode\n\nI tested this approach on a couple machines that needed a clean before building and works OK with `rmdir`.

I'll go though how I debugged this in case it helps shed some more light on the problem.\n\nTL;DR it is fixed but I don't know what was causing it.\n\nAtom handles text input using a hidden input field. I suspected that the problem was this hidden input field was losing focus, so I added `setInterval((-> console.log document.activeElement), 1000)` to my `~/.atom/init.coffee` file. This logs if the hidden input loses focus. After double clicking around awhile the hidden input would lose focus and the body element would become focused.\n\nI noticed the mouseDown event was being caught in an unknown parent of EditorComponent and would focus the body element. When the dev tools are used to look at what is bound to the mouseDown event you can see a react component is bound (expected) and a jquery object (unexpected):\n\n![editor-component coffee - _users_corey_github_atom](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/596/3195476/3429481c-ed11-11e3-8a6a-0f7ac5467b94.jpg)\n\nI solved this by making sure the mouseDown event in EditorComponent doesn't bubble. But I still wanted to know what event handler was causing this problem. I searched in Atom Core for mousedown handlers but none of those caused the problem. This led me to believe the problem was in a package, so I ran Atom in safe mode (`atom --safe`), which will start Atom with out any downloaded packages. In safe mode I could still recreate the problem. But the jquery mousedown event was no longer in the dev tools event viewer. I found out it was the color-viewer package that was adding the mousedown event handler to body, but removing that package didn't fix the problem.\n\nSo I'm left wondering what the problem was and why it only happened with the react editor.\n\nCloses
