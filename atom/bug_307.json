Whenever I open Atom, I noticed my HDD led blinking like crazy. iotop shows atom is doing a lot of disk reads:\n\n```\n 5241 be/4 jfsantos    6.48 M/s    0.00 B/s  0.00 % 37.54 % atom --ev~trap.js');\n 5242 be/4 jfsantos    5.75 M/s    0.00 B/s  0.00 % 36.67 % atom --ev~trap.js');\n 5244 be/4 jfsantos    4.75 M/s    0.00 B/s  0.00 % 32.67 % atom --ev~trap.js');\n 5243 be/4 jfsantos    3.83 M/s    0.00 B/s  0.00 % 30.87 % atom --ev~trap.js');\n```\n\nAs soon as I close Atom, everything gets back to normal (iotop shows 0.00 B/s as total disk reads, as opposed to something around 12 M/s with atom running). I tried disabling all 3rd party plugins I downloaded but it did not help. Is there anything I could do to help investigating this issue?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6570","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6570/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6570/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6570/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/6570","id":71915052,"number":6570,"title":"[Gutter] Clear custom gutter decorations from previous usages of a custo...","user":{"login":"jssln","id":1017111,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1017111?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jssln","html_url":"https://github.com/jssln","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jssln/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jssln/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jssln/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jssln/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jssln/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jssln/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jssln/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jssln/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jssln/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-04-29T15:57:06Z","updated_at":"2015-05-12T21:08:32Z","closed_at":"2015-04-29T21:26:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/6570","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/6570","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/6570.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/6570.patch"},"body":"...m gutter element\n\nThis is @nathansobo's fix for line numbers (https://github.com/atom/atom/commit/192997c8cf4479c4cae155207ad3b175c0ee9498) applied to custom gutters.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6570/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6569","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6569/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6569/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6569/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6569","id":71857744,"number":6569,"title":"Extra quote is added when backslash is present in a string","user":{"login":"yihangho","id":4226956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4226956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihangho","html_url":"https://github.com/yihangho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihangho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihangho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihangho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihangho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihangho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihangho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihangho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihangho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihangho/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-04-29T12:12:53Z","updated_at":"2015-04-29T13:31:31Z","closed_at":"2015-04-29T13:31:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Not sure how to actually put this in words, but see this:\n\n![Animated GIF](http://i.imgur.com/DaZkgtj.gif)\n\nOn each line, right before the (original) last quote, I pressed on the key to insert a quote.

As you might imagine, this leads to difficult maintenance and introducing regressions becomes much easier. :fearful:\n\nThat said, this layer is not intrinsically convoluted and, therefore, I think we have some chance to make it better. This PR attempts to bring some clarity to one aspect @nathansobo pointed during a conversation and which I totally agree with.\n\nWhen dealing with batching, I introduced an helper function (`@batch`) which enabled me to, more or less, decorate a function and have it batched automagically. While this removed a bit of duplication, it didn't improve code quality at all, making the batching process look a bit opaque.\n\nThe intent of this PR is to replace this mechanism with a simpler one, which solely relies on booleans. I have payed attention to preserve the original behavior but, as illustrated earlier on, it's easy to overlook mistakes and it would be great if you could try this out to spot regressions of any kind. (/cc: @atom/feedback)\n\nGoing forward I think that the path should be to split `TextEditorPresenter` into many smaller objects (e.g. one for lines, one for gutters, etc... maybe the structure could even match how we currently organize _UI Components_). This way `TextEditorPresenter` could act as the glue which makes those smaller presenters stick together. If we follow this design I think we can make our test suite even more precise (i.e. keep some integration tests in `TextEditorPresenter` and test each component separately). @nathansobo: what are your :thought_balloon: on this?\n\nMy plan is to achieve this incrementally :footprints:: this PR is just the first, tiny step; as we touch related areas of this code we should take the time to give them some :heart:.\n\nAny suggestion, proposal or feedback is very welcome! :bow:\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6566/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4845","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507407731","x-github-request-id":"C5BE:3670:A035FF:19CC135:59D92B9C","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=308>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=524>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/3228505/issues?state=all&page=306>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"6c60e2049068db68feb450a50e49f5dc\"","status":"200 OK"}}
