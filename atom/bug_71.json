Right now, if I try to edit a text in Spanish I get this (they are all valid words in Spanish):\r\n\r\n![odd](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2801252/22533843/a58fa20c-e8f0-11e6-8851-8b82bfda70de.png)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a new document and use \"Github Markdown\" syntax highlighting.\r\n2. Write some text in Spanish and see how Atom highlights valid words as wrong.\r\n3. Doubt your skills in your native language. Start to doubt everything you believe is true. Conclude that it's probably not me and I should ask for help in Atom's Github.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** there are many options that would be better:\r\n- No syntax highlighting. English is just one more language and it wouldn't be reasonable to expect that people around the world only write text in English.\r\n- Make a smart choice. I am sure there are many evaluation techniques to find out the current language, and the language-checker could be based on this. [Example of package](https://github.com/FGRibreau/node-language-detect). However, this would have to be complemented with.\r\n- Allow the user to choose a language. It could be a sub-menu in the bottom-right next to the syntax highlight, but that would probably require a big overhaul. I am **not** asking to remove UTF-8, please don't change that as it's the best from JS world (previous PHP developer here).\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** forces you to write in English if you don't want to be overwhelmed with red warnings.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.8.0\r\nElectron: 0.36.8\r\nChrome  : 47.0.2526.110\r\nNode    : 5.1.1\r\nOS: Ubuntu 16.04\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nJapanese language is correctly(?) ignored:\r\n\r\n![jap](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2801252/22534228/e850ae9a-e8f2-11e6-8466-eb3a1f054dfd.png)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13726/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13725","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13725/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13725/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13725/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13725","id":204618013,"number":13725,"title":"Normalize disk drive letter in path on Windows","user":{"login":"hron","id":39293,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/39293?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hron","html_url":"https://github.com/hron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":62363277,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-02-01T15:39:27Z","updated_at":"2017-02-05T01:51:49Z","closed_at":"2017-02-05T01:51:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/13725","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13725","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13725.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13725.patch"},"body":"### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nCurrently atom creates two buffers for the same file if passed paths use difference case for disk drive letter, e.g. `d:\\file.txt` and `D:\\file.txt`\r\n\r\nThis change ensures that the absolute path always has disk drive letter in uppercase. \r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nThe other place where this fix could be applied is [findBufferForPath](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/project.coffee#L331) function. However the used function [resolvePath](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/project.coffee#L229) already has some path normalization code, so I think this is the best fit.\r\n\r\nActually Windows interpreters `file.txt` and `File.txt` as the same file. Maybe it makes sense to extend this patch and make Atom to do the same on this operation system, but I'm not sure because it can be file system specific. Any suggestions are welcome!\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nI believe the current behavior of the editor is wrong for Windows users, so it makes no sense to create a plugin to fix that.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nThe main benefit I would like to get is the ability to click on parsed backtrace in my terminal emulation app (ConEmu). Right now it works, but atom opens second buffer for the same file because it doesn't normalize disk drive letter.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nThe possible drawback is some broken tests, but I've checked that and it seems everything works.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nHere is the related issue #8221. It's not exactly about my problem, but it's very near.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13725/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13724","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13724/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13724/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13724/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13724","id":204615751,"number":13724,"title":"100% CPU on startup with opened files from $HOME folder (electron compile-cache.js, Linux)","user":{"login":"BlueMax","id":1403092,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1403092?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMax","html_url":"https://github.com/BlueMax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMax/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-02-01T15:31:22Z","updated_at":"2017-02-01T18:07:16Z","closed_at":"2017-02-01T18:07:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hallo,\r\ni get 100% CPU (one core) when opening files from $HOME folder (like .xinitrc).

This is due to the fact that the search is being repeated in the buffer (instead of using `scandal` through the workspace API. In order to address this the `TextBuffer.scan` needs to be extended to support the same new options as in the referenced `scandal` ticket. Therefore I have prefixed the title with `[WIP]` for now.~~ This has been address with the PR to the `text-buffer` package.\r\n\r\n* Add test coverage / update existing specs as soon as there is a consensus on the selected approach and the feature works.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13712","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13712/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13712/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13712/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13712","id":203890445,"number":13712,"title":"Wrong .gitignore path on Windows","user":{"login":"SebastianPozoga","id":1093166,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1093166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebastianPozoga","html_url":"https://github.com/SebastianPozoga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebastianPozoga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebastianPozoga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebastianPozoga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebastianPozoga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebastianPozoga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebastianPozoga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebastianPozoga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebastianPozoga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebastianPozoga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722930,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/duplicate","name":"duplicate","color":"cccccc","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-01-29T19:37:03Z","updated_at":"2017-01-29T19:39:11Z","closed_at":"2017-01-29T19:38:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\r\nWhen I save .gitignore file I take a fail . \r\n\r\n!!!!

Set `atom` as your `VISUAL`.\r\n2. Perform a `git rebase -i` with or without `--root`.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nA new tab opens in the same project as the directory I'm in containing `git-rebase-todo` and takes action only when I save and close the file.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\n`git rebase -i --root`\r\n![rebase](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/109225/22371780/feadcb02-e490-11e6-83f0-b83adcc39a08.gif)\r\n\r\n`git commit`\r\n![commit](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/109225/22371894/dd6645ea-e491-11e6-8cd3-06f63d5b2ec2.gif)\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:**\r\n\r\n100% of time with an interactive rebase\r\n0% of the time with a commit\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n```\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.2 (16C67)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.13.1 (most recent at time of writing)\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\napm  1.14.1\r\nnpm  3.10.5\r\nnode 4.4.5\r\npython 2.7.10\r\ngit 2.11.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nUsing `atom --wait` as my `VISUAL` does not have the same problem, however it is less than ideal because opening a new window rather than a new tab is subject to atom's relatively slow startup time.\r\n\r\n[1] I don't know how recently this started happening as it has been a while since I did an interactive rebase.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13705/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13704","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13704/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13704/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13704/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13704","id":203579010,"number":13704,"title":"SyntaxError: Block-scoped declarations (let, const, function, class) not yet supported outside strict mode","user":{"login":"JPRuehmann","id":4321829,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4321829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPRuehmann","html_url":"https://github.com/JPRuehmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPRuehmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPRuehmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPRuehmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPRuehmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPRuehmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPRuehmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPRuehmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPRuehmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPRuehmann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-01-27T08:19:59Z","updated_at":"2017-01-27T17:21:52Z","closed_at":"2017-01-27T17:21:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Next Compile Problem\r\n\r\n```\r\nNode:   v4.4.2\r\nNpm:    v3.10.5\r\nInstalling script dependencies\r\nInstalling apm\r\nInstalling modules âœ“\r\nWrote Dependencies Fingerprint: /home/ruehmann/atom/node_modules/.dependencies-fingerprint 6c64226e594e178c89ff99422349f9565865f5df\r\n/home/ruehmann/atom/script/lib/code-sign-on-mac.js:13\r\n  let certPath = process.env.ATOM_MAC_CODE_SIGNING_CERT_PATH;\r\n  ^^^\r\n\r\nSyntaxError: Block-scoped declarations (let, const, function, class) not yet supported outside strict mode\r\n  at exports.runInThisContext (vm.js:53:16)\r\n  at Module._compile (module.js:373:25)\r\n  at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:416:10)\r\n  at Module.load (/home/ruehmann/atom/node_modules/coffee-script/lib/coffee-script/register.js:45:36)\r\n  at Function.Module._load (module.js:300:12)\r\n  at Module.require (module.js:353:17)\r\n  at require (internal/module.js:12:17)\r\n  at Object.<anonymous> (/home/ruehmann/atom/script/build:28:23)\r\n  at Module._compile (module.js:409:26)\r\n  at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:416:10)\r\n  at Module.load (module.js:343:32)\r\n  at Function.Module._load (module.js:300:12)\r\n  at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:441:10)\r\n  at startup (node.js:139:18)\r\n  at node.js:968:3\r\n```\r\n\r\nLinux 16.04 LTS\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?
