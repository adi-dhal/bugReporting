to issue #332, if you try to draw the stage to a scaled `BitmapData`, any objects with `clipRects` won't get drawn properly.\n\nI'm using this code to capture the stage (modified from `drawToBitmapData()` to allow for transparent bg of different colours and scaling):\n\n```\npublic function screenshot( scale:Number = 1.0, bgColour:uint = 0xffffff, bgAlpha:Number = 1.0 ):BitmapData\n{\n    // get the stage\n    var stage:Stage     = Starling.current.stage;\n    var w:Number        = stage.stageWidth;\n    var h:Number        = stage.stageHeight;\n    var c:Colour        = Colour.fromHexi( bgColour ); // Colour is a simple support class to make working with colours easier\n    c.alpha             = bgAlpha;\n    var bmd:BitmapData  = new BitmapData( w * scale, h * scale, ( c.alpha < 1.0 ), 0x00000000 );\n\n    // create our render support\n    var rs:RenderSupport    = new RenderSupport;\n    rs.renderTarget         = null;\n    if( scale != 1.0 )\n        rs.scaleMatrix( scale, scale );\n    rs.setOrthographicProjection( 0, 0, w, h );\n\n    // clear the support to our desired colour (NOTE: seems to want pre-multiplied alpha)\n    c.premultiplyAlpha();\n    rs.clear( c.rgb );\n\n    // render the stage\n    stage.render( rs, 1.0 );\n    rs.finishQuadBatch();\n\n    // render to our BitmapData\n    Starling.current.context.drawToBitmapData( bmd );\n    Starling.current.context.present(); // required on some platforms to avoid flickering\n    return bmd;\n}\n```\n\nTo try and get around the `clipRect` problem, I originally tried to copy all the stage objects into a `Sprite`, `flatten()` it, draw, then recopy them back to the stage. That essentially just removed the `clipRect` altogether; not very useful, as the `clipRect`` was there for a purpose :)\n\nIt's possible to get a scaled screenshot, by drawing it full size first, then drawing that _that_ `BitmapData` to another one, with the proper scale. While this works, it's not an ideal use of memory.\n\nI looked a bit closer at what was actually drawn when capturing the screen with `clipRect` objects in it, and it's not that they weren't showing, but it seemed more like the final coordinates weren't calculated properly (I guess because it uses something like `GL_SCISSOR_RECT` in the background which works in screen coords?)\n\nI went into `starling.display.Sprite` and changed (line 134):\n\n```\npublic function getClipRect(targetSpace:DisplayObject, resultRect:Rectangle=null):Rectangle\n```\n\nto\n\n```\npublic function getClipRect(targetSpace:DisplayObject, resultRect:Rectangle=null, support:RenderSupport=null):Rectangle\n```\n\nline 144 from:\n\n```\nvar transMatrix:Matrix = getTransformationMatrix(targetSpace, sHelperMatrix);\n```\n\nto\n\n```\nvar transMatrix:Matrix = (support != null) ? support.modelViewMatrix : getTransformationMatrix(targetSpace, sHelperMatrix);\n```\n\nand line 194 from:\n\n```\nvar clipRect:Rectangle = support.pushClipRect(getClipRect(stage, sHelperRect));\n```\n\nto\n\n```\nvar clipRect:Rectangle = support.pushClipRect(getClipRect(stage, sHelperRect, support));\n```\n\nThis will correctly draw the object at scale, with the `clipRect` in the right place, though I don't know enough about the Starling internals to know what other sort of impact this will have. So far I haven't noticed anything amiss, but then my tests aren't exactly exhaustive\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/516","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/516/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/516/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/516/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/516","id":30746887,"number":516,"title":"ImageDecodingPolicy.ON_LOAD in AssetManager causes 2 minutes load time on android","user":{"login":"NagRock","id":5803314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5803314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NagRock","html_url":"https://github.com/NagRock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NagRock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NagRock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NagRock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NagRock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NagRock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NagRock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NagRock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NagRock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NagRock/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-04-03T05:04:11Z","updated_at":"2014-04-03T11:45:14Z","closed_at":"2014-04-03T10:48:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"http://forum.starling-framework.org/topic/texture-atlas-load-time-on-android\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/515","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/515/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/515/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/515/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/515","id":30575433,"number":515,"title":"Possible to expose Juggler objects?","user":{"login":"kheftel","id":669328,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/669328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kheftel","html_url":"https://github.com/kheftel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kheftel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kheftel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kheftel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kheftel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kheftel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kheftel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kheftel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kheftel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kheftel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":130317,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2014-04-01T06:57:02Z","updated_at":"2014-04-07T18:25:08Z","closed_at":"2014-04-04T17:42:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm attempting to use one or more Jugglers with delayedCalls to spawn enemies in my game.

looking into adding some sort of caching to AssetsManager.\nMy plan is to copy the loader's data to a local cache folder after loading an external resource then use that local url instead of the external url on subsequents loading.\n\nHowever, at the moment I'm not sure where to hook my code to do the \"put in cache\" thing and even after looking carefully at the code, it seems impossible without beeing \"invasive\" :-)\n\nI propose to add this simple event to let me hook my own \"save to cache\" code easily.\nUsing the urlLoader as event data, I can retrieve the url and the byte array and do my stuff.\n\nThanks for considering it (or pointing me to the right direction if you see a better way to do it).\n\nBtw, I written the code \"blind\" (directly on github) so it may not be perfect.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/513","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/513/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/513/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/513/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/513","id":30110968,"number":513,"title":"SubTexture:

this recent topic where a Scout profile is shown for an 'idle' app, but more specifically when BitmapFont text is shown on screen (the Starling showStats text in this case):\nhttp://forum.starling-framework.org/topic/memory-usage-increasing-at-constant-rate-200kb10seconds\n\nIf you focus in on the screenshot on the expanded area related to BitmapFont, and particularly frequent changing BitmapFont text (like timers or stats text as in Starling showStats).\n\nI think it hilights a few areas of improvements that could reduce temp object creation internal to Starling even further.\n\nThe one simple specific suggestion would be to add a:\nTexture.getFrame(resultRectangle=null):Rectangle\nfunction along with/used instead of the current texture.frame property that forces a new Rectangle instance on every call.\n\nAs you can see in the Scout profile, BitmapFont needs to call texture.frame on every update of text because of the image.readjustSize call, so with an added Texture.getFrame(resultRectangle=null), Starling could use this with a static HELPER Rectangle in three places in Starling source code:\nImage constructor \nImage readjustSize\nBitmapFont parseFontXml\n\nThe second area for improvement is all the objects that are temporarily created in BitmapFont.arrangeChars\nthis obviously gets called every time the text changes.\nThere are minor things like reusing a static instance for\n`lines = new Vector.<Vector.<CharLocation>>();`\ninstead of creating a new one each time and in the while loop, setting its length = 0 would work.\n\nAlso, I think a more fundamental caching of the `Vector.<CharLocation>`, as well as new `<CharLocation>[]` could be made, since arrangeCharacters is a private function, and given that the length of certain text strings are multiple and small, one could imagine reusing `Vector.<CharLocation>` and CharLocation instances in an internal pool (possibly setting a max pool size of like 20-30 so most smaller text strings just reuse instances but if someone asked for an extremely large text string it would just create and throw away new CharLocation instances as it does now)\n\nI realize this optimization is more complicated and only useful in BitmapFont environments, but I think BitmapFont use in mobile environments is the preferred technique to reduce memory use, so I think the BitmapFont code could also benefit from super-optimized low temporary object creation too.\n\nThanks\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/493/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4751","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507250212","x-github-request-id":"D7EF:572C:16686E8:2C80A14:59D6C7CA","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/2097941/issues?state=all&page=18>;
