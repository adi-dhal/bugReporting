reported by Eyal Katz in [this forum thread](http://forum.starling-framework.org/topic/bug-displayobjectaddeventlistenerenter_frame-can-register-twice): \n\nI think I found a bug in DisplayObject.addEventListener when adding `ENTER_FRAME` events, and will want your attention about it.\n\nIn DisplayObject.addEventListener, Starling assumes that if an object is already on stage, then its `ADDED_TO_STAGE` event will not be called (but this can actually happen when the entire code is running during an `Event.ADDED` listener, which is prior to `ADDED_TO_STAGE`).\n\nThis code will reproduce the bug:\n\n``` as3\nvar test:Sprite = new Sprite();\ntest.addEventListener(Event.ADDED, onAddedToSprite);\n\n// Adding test to a Sprite is ALREADY on stage\nspriteOnStage.addChild(test);\n\nfunction onAddedToSprite(e:Event):void {\n    test.addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, onEnterFrame);\n}\n\nfunction onEnterFrame(e:Event):void {\n    // We'll end up here TWICE on every frame...\n    trace(\"I will be printed twice in every frame!\" + Starling.current.frameID);\n}\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/826/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/825","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/825/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/825/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/825/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/825","id":147850990,"number":825,"title":"Software
