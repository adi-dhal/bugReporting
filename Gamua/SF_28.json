Otherwise the Event.REMOVE_FROM_JUGGLER is only fired in advanceTime of the tween but with these remove calls, the tween will never get those final advanceTime calls.\n\nAs this relates to the pooled tweens, the only time tween instances get back into the pool is by getting onPooledTweenComplete called from Event.REMOVE_FROM_JUGGLER but tweens removed by remove() or removeTweens() won't ever end up back inside the pool.\n\nAnother possibly minor issue is that \ntween.removeEventListener(Event.REMOVE_FROM_JUGGLER, onPooledTweenComplete);\nis never removed as a listener function though maybe not as big a deal if it will always be needed\n\nThanks, hopefully I'm not forcing you to look at a wild goose chase that I am just not grokking the code properly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/192/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/191","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/191/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/191/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/191/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/191","id":7845950,"number":191,"title":"QuadBatch is crashing at createBuffers","user":{"login":"XTDStudios","id":1979020,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1979020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XTDStudios","html_url":"https://github.com/XTDStudios","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XTDStudios/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XTDStudios/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XTDStudios/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XTDStudios/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XTDStudios/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XTDStudios/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XTDStudios/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XTDStudios/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XTDStudios/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2012-10-25T00:26:44Z","updated_at":"2012-10-25T15:11:45Z","closed_at":"2012-10-25T15:10:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When the context is lost, and starling is not marked to handle it.

When render cycle encounter QuadBatch, it call renderCustom for it, and never try to add with current batch.\n\nI suppose the point was that bitmap fonts is always in separate textures. But I have my graphics and fonts all in one texture (that approach is fault in some way too, because small font like 12p on texture 2048x2048 size always turns out baggy, but that can be fixed. I did it with a crude crutch, but I hope in time that problem will go away eventually).\n\nSo I wanted text to batch as well, so I made this kind of change in my fork: https://github.com/grozamorei/Starling-Framework/commit/c1fd5426e2459a3293a0d4a76cf2e422270532eb. \nVery crude and simple. Now I have all I want in one batch in my app, including text.\n\nSame goes for the text renderer in feathers.\n\nIs this approach worth the effort, I wonder? Do I have better performance or I just making bad moves? Was separating batch for bitmap fonts intentional?\n\nIf I'm doing wrong, please tell and close the issue.

guys,\n\nWe've added the old flash.display.Graphics API to Starling, as we keep finding we need it in our projects.\n\nCentral to this implementation are [Jon Pace](https://github.com/jonathanrpace)'s:\n\nstarling.display.graphics.Fill\nstarling.display.graphics.Stroke\n\nThese both extend:\n\nstarling.display.graphics.Graphic\n\nwhich extends:\n\nstarling.display.DisplayObject\n\n..and wraps up a reference to:\n\nstarling.display.materials.StandardMaterial\n\nIf you take a look at the Sandbox example, you'll see that the Fill and Stroke classes provide a more powerful, lower level API than the familiar Graphics API and can be used directly.\n\nAlthough more powerful, this API is unfamiliar to the regular Flash dev, so in the spirit of the Starling framework we've also provided an augmented Graphics API. If you look at GraphicsExample, you'll see we've provided:\n\nstarling.display.Graphics\n\n..which provides a higher level API that wraps up references to Fill and Stroke. The idea being that the developer could first familiarise themselves with this API, delve into it and discover lower level API.\n\nAs well as providing familiar functions such as:\n\nbeginFill()\nbeginBitmapFill()\ndrawCircle()\ndrawRect()\nlineStyle()\nmoveTo()\nlineTo()\n\nWe've also augmented the API to provide:\n\nbeginTextureFill()\nlineTexture()\n\nIf you run GraphicsExample, you'll see the last example is a rectangle with a rock fill texture and a grass line texture.\n\nThere are also 2 other examples:\n\nFillExample demonstrates a Fill being drawn at runtime.\nAnd Profiling, which is obviously a performance test.\n\nWe hope you like what we've made and see it as a worthy addition to the framework!\n\ncheers\nrob\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/176/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/175","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/175/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/175/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/175/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/175","id":7227562,"number":175,"title":"Quad width/height cannot be set correctly when rotated","user":{"login":"mhazy","id":1699370,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1699370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhazy","html_url":"https://github.com/mhazy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhazy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhazy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhazy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhazy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhazy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhazy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhazy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhazy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhazy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2012-09-28T19:54:30Z","updated_at":"2012-10-03T11:47:11Z","closed_at":"2012-10-03T11:47:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When a quad's width and height are changed, the quad is scaled  based on its current bounds.\n\nWhen the quad is rotated, the bounds are no longer the same as the quad's actual width/height, causing the width/height to not reflect the desired values.\n\nWorkaround: Create a 1x1 quad, and use scaleX/scaleY to change its size.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/174","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/174/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/174/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/174/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/174","id":7055682,"number":174,"title":"In mobile IOS/android.
