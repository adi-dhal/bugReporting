is a feature I've put into a current project.  When enabled, the clip will play to the end, then effectively play in reverse back to the start, in a back-forth way.  I thought I'd see if it could be worked into the MovieClip class as a built in property.\n\nIn effect, it replicates the existing frames and adds them in reverse to the MovieClipFrames vector.\n\nIn handling things like numFrames and currentFrame, I've obscured the return value to only reflect the original clip.  The reasoning is I thought it'd be easier for people to continue treating the clip as unchanged in length and framecount, it simply plays in reverse when it gets to the end.\n\nI'm uncertain if currentTime should be obscured in the same way, my gut feeling is it should remain unobscured, so the full play time back and forth, is twice the normal play time.\n\nWhen adding and removing frames to a clip, if returnPlay is active, the logic works like this:\nif (returnPlay == true)\nreturnPlay = false: remove the mirrored frames\nadd or remove frames\nreturnPlay = true: re-mirror the frames\n\nThere's perhaps a more elegant way to do this rather than destroying and re-creating all the mirrored frames each time, but it's not something I anticipate needs to be done too frequently so I've left it for now.\n\nKnown quirks: The first and last frames of the clip are doubled.  I'm not sure if this is an issue, or expected behaviour?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/816/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/815","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/815/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/815/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/815/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/815","id":142154174,"number":815,"title":"Hand cursor stick after a tween and removeChild()","user":{"login":"ANVoevodin","id":17962133,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/17962133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANVoevodin","html_url":"https://github.com/ANVoevodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANVoevodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANVoevodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANVoevodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANVoevodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANVoevodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANVoevodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANVoevodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANVoevodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANVoevodin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-03-20T11:25:34Z","updated_at":"2016-04-14T09:05:53Z","closed_at":"2016-04-14T09:05:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi.

might be intended behaviour in 2.0, but it used to work so I thought I'd report it. I create a new ColorMatrixFilter() and assign it to a static variable:\n\n```\nprotected static var GREY_FILTER:ColorMatrixFilter;\n\nif (GREY_FILTER == null)\n{\n        GREY_FILTER = new ColorMatrixFilter();\n        GREY_FILTER.adjustSaturation( -1);\n}\n```\n\nThe idea is that I can apply this filter to any instance of the sprite which needs to be 'greyed out', without having to instantiate the filter every time. Only the first sprite will create it.\n\nIt works if I only have one sprite, but as soon as I add another I get this errror:\n\n[Fault] exception, information=Error: Cannot render filter without target\nFault, render() at FragmentFilter.as:128\n**\\* Security Sandbox Violation ***\nSecurityDomain 'app:/test.swf' tried to access incompatible context 'http://adobe.com/apollo'\nUNCAUGHTERROR: Cannot render filter without target\nError: Cannot render filter without target\n    at starling.filters::FragmentFilter/render()[D:\\workspace\\shared\\starling\\filters\\FragmentFilter.as:128]\n    at starling.display::DisplayObjectContainer/render()[D:\\workspace\\shared\\starling\\display\\DisplayObjectContainer.as:385]\n    at starling.display::DisplayObjectContainer/render()[D:\\workspace\\shared\\starling\\display\\DisplayObjectContainer.as:386]\n    at starling.display::DisplayObjectContainer/render()[D:\\workspace\\shared\\starling\\display\\DisplayObjectContainer.as:386]\n    at starling.display::DisplayObjectContainer/render()[D:\\workspace\\shared\\starling\\display\\DisplayObjectContainer.as:386]\n    at starling.core::Starling/render()[D:\\workspace\\shared\\starling\\core\\Starling.as:448]\n    at starling.core::Starling/nextFrame()[D:\\workspace\\shared\\starling\\core\\Starling.as:400]\n    at starling.core::Starling/onEnterFrame()[D:\\workspace\\shared\\starling\\core\\Starling.as:597]\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/808/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/807","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/807/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/807/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/807/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/807","id":138125348,"number":807,"title":"Skip frames if nothing has been changed","user":{"login":"maximgavrilov","id":1452032,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1452032?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximgavrilov","html_url":"https://github.com/maximgavrilov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximgavrilov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximgavrilov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximgavrilov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximgavrilov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximgavrilov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximgavrilov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximgavrilov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximgavrilov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximgavrilov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":130317,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-03-03T09:29:10Z","updated_at":"2016-04-29T06:12:43Z","closed_at":"2016-03-27T18:17:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"For UI-oriented applications (especially mobile ones) it is very common to skip rendering if nothing has been changed.
