After I started my game and then locked my windows for a period of time(such as 1 hour or more) and unlocked it, all the textures of my game would be recovered, everything  went well until I put a lot of particles on screen, the screen would be stuck for a split second(or many seconds, sometimes the FPS would just drop to 1-2) then return to normal(some frames skipped) every time if big amount of particles appeared, this would not happen if I don't lock my computer,  this would also not happen if there is not much particles. \nHave you had any idea on this?

In the worse case where you have one tinted quad in between 2 untinted quads on a long list of quads, this deteriorates a lot the performances...\n\nWe'll need to potentially rearrange our children list not to mix tinted and untinted.

Unfortunately there is an exception when attempting to render an empty QuadBatch because of a null index buffer.\n\nThis is reproducible when calling flatten on a Sprite for which the first child is a TextField.\n\nFix proposal:\n- if the current QuadBatch in empty, fill it by the content of QuadBatch object provided as the argument of the compileObject method (or eventually replace it by the clone)\n\nAs a bonus, it would be excellent to merge the current QuadBatch with the new one if they are compatible. For instance, a sprite full of TextField all sharing the same BitmapFont / blendmode... could be flattened into a single QuadBatch !\n\nLet me know your thoughts.\n\nCheers.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/92/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/91","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/91/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/91/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/91/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/91","id":4153506,"number":91,"title":"Text

Starling is founded on the instantiation of a RootClass, it's important for listeners outside Starling to know when the instance of that RootClass is available. And because Starling both creates and adds that instance to stage, there's no determinative way to know this has occurred at present. I've added a dispatch from Starling.initializeRoot(). This Event occurs after rootObject is added to Stage, so it effectively informs listeners that Starling is safe to interact with.\n\nArguably there should be two Events: one when the rootObject is created and a second when rootObject is added to stage. This would let a listener perform actions between those two Events. I'll leave it to you to determine if the extra event is useful, but I'm reasonably certain that at least the code I've provided is beneficial.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/84/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/83","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/83/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/83/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/83/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/83","id":3974661,"number":83,"title":"Add a property similar to mouseChildren","user":{"login":"joshtynjala","id":141885,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/141885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala","html_url":"https://github.com/joshtynjala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":21,"created_at":"2012-04-04T17:25:15Z","updated_at":"2014-04-25T15:38:34Z","closed_at":"2012-04-19T12:44:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"mouseChildren = false stops children from dispatching mouse events, but it allows their parent to continue to use their hit areas to dispatch its own mouse events.

Put enough of those on stage, and any touch activity will noticeably affect FPS. I don't really care if the mouse is specifically over one of the nine children, but I may want their parent to be touchable.\n\n2) In the thread below from the forums, someone is trying to access a Sprite that contains the touch target, but is deeper in the display list than the event's currentTarget (the stage, in this case).

primaryFeather,\n\nI'm working on a starling game and its almost done. The problem however is that I updated my starling version to the latest github version. What happened is the following:\n- I updated starling\n- Start my project and everything gets rendered\n- Then, 1 frame after everything is rendered I get an error saying theres a null object reference in the function redrawContents in Textfield.as\n\nI debugged this function and see following:\n\n if (mContents)\n                if (mIsRenderedText) (mContents as Image).texture.dispose();   <-- this line\n                mContents.removeFromParent(true);\n }\n\nThe error is created on that line, so I changed it to this:\n\n if (mContents)\n            {\n                if (mIsRenderedText){\n                    var img:Image = mContents as Image;\n                    img.texture.dispose();\n                }\n                mContents.removeFromParent(true);\n            }\n\nAnd then it turns out that img = null. In other words, it can not cast mContents to an Image.\n\nDo you have any ideas about how this is possible? I never changed anything on the framework and just downloaded the latest version.\n\nCheers,\nMarc from Holland\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/79/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/78","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/78/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/78/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/78/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/78","id":3758759,"number":78,"title":"Optimized contains()","user":{"login":"joshtynjala","id":141885,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/141885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala","html_url":"https://github.com/joshtynjala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2012-03-22T07:03:39Z","updated_at":"2012-03-22T09:30:11Z","closed_at":"2012-03-22T09:29:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pulls/78","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/78","diff_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/78.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/78.patch"},"body":"I changed contains() to search upwards from the child rather than downwards from the container.

'value'\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/76/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/75","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/75/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/75/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/75/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/75","id":3642721,"number":75,"title":"Add

realize the list of arguments to Starling constructor is getting quite large, but the potential benefit of allowing antiAliasing in the constructor is to avoid unnecessary multiple calls to updateViewPort() and subsequently calls to context.configureBackBuffer().\n\nUnless it is deemed that multiple calls to context.configureBackBuffer() isn't that expensive (though it seems to be hinted on AIR docs that it should be avoided) we can leave as is.\n\nOn startup, most apps are going to pick and set a single antiAliasing value for Starling/context3D and not change it dynamically,\nbut even if set directly after calling the Starling constructor (and because the constructor makes the requestContext3D call) setting starling.antiAliasing is going to force a second context.configureBackBuffer()

order to facilitate mixing Starling with other 3d rendered effects, it would be greatly beneficial to be able to control whether enableDepthAndStencil is set on the underlying context. By adding a boolean property to starling (defaulting to false, of course), updateViewPort would create back buffer with depth buffers. 3d content can then be mixed in via specially crafted extensions for those who want to do such things. This would be very similar to the behavior of the current mAntiAliasing property on Starling.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/74/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/73","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/73/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/73/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/73/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/73","id":3597459,"number":73,"title":"Expose baseline in BitmapFont","user":{"login":"joshtynjala","id":141885,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/141885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala","html_url":"https://github.com/joshtynjala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":130317,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2012-03-10T21:07:06Z","updated_at":"2012-04-19T12:36:01Z","closed_at":"2012-04-19T12:36:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There's an attribute called \"base\" in the &lt;common/&gt; element of the XML files created by BMFont.
