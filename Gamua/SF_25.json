The method would be called right before the text was rendered to the BitmapData, in `createRenderedContents`, and it'd pass in the flash TextField object as well as the current TextFormat applied to the starling TextField object. The subclass could apply whichever `TextFormat`s it desires, and then when they were done Starling would take care of the rest.\n\nHow do you guys feel about this idea?

The width and height of that rectangle is then bumped up to the next power of two. The texture that is filtered (and sent to to FragmentFilter's activate() method) is set to those dimensions.\n\nNow say, for an example, I have a game with a character that for some stupid reason is 129 pixels tall. That character is standing in a pool of water, so I write a fragment shader to use as a filter. I pass the value .5 to that shader as I only want to apply the effect to the lower half of the texture (don't want the hero to drown :) ). The problem is, since the texture is now bumped up to the next power of 2, it now has a height of 256 so my water level, rather than being at the (129 \\* .5) pixel mark is now at the 128 (256 \\* .5) pixel mark. Assuming the filter effect is visible at all, it only affects the bottom row of pixels of my filtered image - not the whole bottom half of the character as I would have hoped.\n\nAs a work around, if you know the dimensions of your filtered object you can send a ratio to the  shader - something like (.5 \\* actualHeight) / texture.height for example. If you don't know the actual size of your filtered object though (say you have scaling in place where objects are scaled by a user controlled camera or whatever) you can be in real trouble.\n\nOne solution would be to not bump up the object's bounds to the next power of 2. Simply commenting out the 2 lines of code which does that solves all problems. However, if that mod was added for future proofing or performance optimization, well, removing it would not be good.\n\nAnother idea is perhaps to temporarily save the object's bounds prior to the POT operation and send it to the FragmentFilter's activate() method. That way when writing your own filters you would have access to both a Rectangle instance representing the display objects actual dimension (height of 129 pixels in my example) and the Texture instance (with a height of 256 in my example). Then for UV calculations you can do something like I did above.\n\nSomething look at and consider anyway.\n\nThank you,\n-Devon\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/260/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/259","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/259/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/259/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/259/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/259","id":10061342,"number":259,"title":"Scaffold_Mobile for browser","user":{"login":"JulianG","id":237818,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/237818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianG","html_url":"https://github.com/JulianG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2013-01-17T15:06:34Z","updated_at":"2013-01-18T06:56:56Z","closed_at":"2013-01-17T15:16:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm using the Scaffold_Mobile for my game, using the AssetManager and everything works just perfect.It saved me a lot of time and I'm very thankful for that.\n\nBut I reached a point where I'd love to share my work in progress with some of my friends and I think showing the game in the browser with flash player would be very useful. \n\nUnfortunately I think the AssetManager uses some AIR-only classes which aren't available in the browser flash player.\n\nI would love AssetManager to work both in the browser and in AIR.\nIs there anything that can be done?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/258","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/258/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/258/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/258/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/258","id":10042229,"number":258,"title":"Tween: function to get end value for a property","user":{"login":"joshtynjala","id":141885,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/141885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala","html_url":"https://github.com/joshtynjala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2013-01-17T00:47:46Z","updated_at":"2013-01-18T11:31:12Z","closed_at":"2013-01-17T08:59:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Something like this:\n\n```\nvar endValue:Number = tween.getEndValue(\"x\")\n```\n\nUse case: I have a running tween.

When you call render, mBufferTexture and mActiveTexture are swapped, but the superclass SubTexture's mParent isn't.
