Maybe you don't want to change how this works, and maybe this implied syncing with the active RenderSupport.blendMode does need to be enforced by developer code externally, but I technically think the way blendMode is passed around when calls to render (and optionally batch) QuadBatch and Quad are unnecessarily tied to the active state of RenderSupport.blendmode when it doesn't have to be.\n\nI came across this peculiarity while trying to use QuadBatches as containers for content in a Sprite but not having them be directly in the DisplayList but just use them in rendering.\n\nA technique you mention a few times in the forums like at:\nhttp://forum.starling-framework.org/topic/rendering-issues-w-custom-displayobject\nwhere I was testing a rewrite of the Spine SkeletonSprite to use this QuadBatch technique to separate the creation of cached skeleton QuadBatches only during an update and outside the normal render() calls.\n\nThe rub comes along when you might try and build up an array of QuadBatches that you use for rendering (like the internal use of an array of QuadBatches in RenderSupport), as you might have a parent sprite container that needs to hold not just one QuadBatch but an array (checking if state changes required in a more complicated rendering use requires multiple QuadBatches).\n\nThe issue is that there are a few places in Starling code where using a QuadBatch which might store its own custom blendMode value is getting ignored by RenderSupport unless you separately also update support.blendMode before calling QuadBatch.render.\n\nFor example: in QuadBatch.render() line 454, there is:\n\n``` as3\nrenderCustom(support.mvpMatrix, alpha * parentAlpha, support.blendMode);\n```\n\nso when a QuadBatch is not batchable it is getting its renderCustom() called with the current value of support.blendMode instead of even passing its own potential current custom blendMode.\n\nNow I understand that the default RenderSupport render loop sets the current blendMode off a DisplayObject.blendMode call before rendering it, but given the code above where an explicit QuadBatch is asked to render, doesn't it make more sense to support its direct blendMode value such as using instead:\n\n``` as3\nrenderCustom(support.mvpMatrix, alpha * parentAlpha, \n    this.blendMode && this.blendMode != BlendMode.AUTO ? this.blendMode : support.blendMode);\n```\n\nAdditionally, in RenderSupport on both batchQuadBatch() and batchQuad() there is first a check of isStateChange() where one of the comparisons is comparing the QuadBatch(Quad) blendMode against the current support.blendMode to make sure whether there is a state change or not, but then when the actual QuadBatch or Quad gets added, only mBlendMode (RenderSupport) and not the actual blendMode value that is stored in the QuadBatch or Quad is used.\n\nIt seems to me the current system essentially forces the proper setting of the active support.blendMode before trying to use QuadBatch or Quads directly during rendering calls, but I think this extra external setting could be avoided if the code just made an attempt of using the blendMode from the QuadBatch or Quad instead of always whatever the current RenderSupport blendMode value is.\n\nSo going back to my example where I am using an array of QuadBatches (not in the display list), I can make things work by doing:\n\n``` as3\nvar numUsedBatches:int  = mCurrentQuadBatchID + 1;\nvar thisQuadBatch:QuadBatch;\nfor (var i:int=0; i<numUsedBatches; ++i) {\n    thisQuadBatch = mQuadBatches[i];\n    support.blendMode = thisQuadBatch.blendMode;\n    thisQuadBatch.render(support, alpha);\n}\n```\n\nbut I would think the extra call to make sure I set the active support.blendMode is just a workaround because calling QuadBatch.render() isn't doing this for me automatically?\n\nMaybe this isn't a big issue for most custom rendering code now, but I wonder if it could be something that trips people up in the future.\n\nThanks\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/458/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/457","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/457/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/457/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/457/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/457","id":24891732,"number":457,"title":"Sprite zero dimension children affect bounds","user":{"login":"ramezrafla","id":1903864,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1903864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramezrafla","html_url":"https://github.com/ramezrafla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramezrafla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramezrafla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramezrafla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramezrafla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramezrafla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramezrafla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramezrafla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramezrafla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramezrafla/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48336470,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/labels/Waiting","name":"Waiting","color":"eb6420","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2013-12-30T17:08:07Z","updated_at":"2014-01-20T07:58:39Z","closed_at":"2014-01-20T07:24:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"While this is not a big issue, and is easy to circumvent programmatically, it can cause issues for new developers.\n\nIf we have a sprite with zero-dimensions sprite or quad as a child at (x,y), the bounds() method considers (x,y) to be within the area to include in the bounds analysis, even if no actual active pixels are present.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/456","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/456/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/456/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/456/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/456","id":24788572,"number":456,"title":"Starling.dispose() Error","user":{"login":"stelsyara","id":6120851,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6120851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stelsyara","html_url":"https://github.com/stelsyara","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stelsyara/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stelsyara/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stelsyara/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stelsyara/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stelsyara/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stelsyara/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stelsyara/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stelsyara/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stelsyara/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":130316,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"e10c02","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":16,"created_at":"2013-12-26T13:46:56Z","updated_at":"2014-01-20T08:30:12Z","closed_at":"2014-01-20T08:30:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"After call Starling.dispose();

if I used delayCall instead of new DelayedCall:\n\n```\n[Fault] exception, information=TypeError: Error #1034: Type Coercion failed: cannot convert []@64ff121 to Function.\n```\n\nIt's an easy fix

When in project comment line 60 in TextInputTestProject.as the StageText work perfect but if don't comment this line the app is crashing.

I have run these things through Scout extensively, and each of the fixes yield measurable results.  These changes makes my test case (below) run TWICE as fast on my stationary PC, from 24,1 to 45.9 FPS measured over 60 frames (frame 200-260) in Scout. It would be interesting to know what difference it could make on a mobile device, if any.\n\nThe benefits come from caching of state and the BitmapData that Starling uses to render the TrueType text to.\n\nI have identified and improved 3 different areas that each chewed up some time for us:\n\n1) the test to see if we have \"drawWithQuality\" only needs to be done once.\n2) setting embedFont = true and then = false takes a bit of CPU, so only check once per font name. \n3) reusing the BitmapData, if possible.\n\nSo, adding this to the class TextField, after the declaration of sNativeTextField:\n\n```\n    // some static helpers to reduce runtime checks.\n    private static var sHasTestedForDrawWithQuality:Boolean = false;\n    private static var sHasDrawWithQuality:Boolean = false;\n    private static var sBitmapData:BitmapData = null;\n    private static var sEmbedFontNames:Dictionary = new Dictionary();\n```\n\nand then:\n\n```\n    // TrueType font rendering\n\n    private function createRenderedContents():void\n    {\n        if (mQuadBatch)\n        {\n            mQuadBatch.removeFromParent(true); \n            mQuadBatch = null; \n        }\n\n        if (mTextBounds == null) \n            mTextBounds = new Rectangle();\n\n        var scale:Number  = Starling.contentScaleFactor;\n        var bitmapData:BitmapData = renderText(scale, mTextBounds);\n        var format:String = \"BGRA_PACKED\" in Context3DTextureFormat ?
