We've been playing around with the immersive mode but we've been getting lots of Context losses so I thought I'd download and test your `Starling-Demo-Mobile`. \r\n\r\nWe downloaded the Sample from Starling 2.1 zip file and only changed the AIR SDK (from 22 to 24) and tested it in all our Android test devices. Our surprise was that the first test with your sample already (in one specific device) presented this context losses we were having by doing something so simple such as increasing/decreasing the volume (which pops-up the native volume display bar) and surprisingly the screen goes black and the context is restored. \r\n\r\nAfter testing it with multiple devices this is the result we got so far:\r\n\r\n- Samsung Galaxy Nexus i9250 (Android Version 4.3) -> Works fine\r\n- Samsung Galaxy S6 (Android Version 6.0.1) -> Works fine\r\n- Acer Iconia A1-830 (Android Version 4.4.2) -> **Fails**\r\n- One Plus One A0001 (Android Version 6.0.1) -> Works fine\r\n- One Plus 3T A3003 (Android Version 7.0) -> Works fine\r\n\r\nWe are testing this because some of our players are reporting this exact same behavior on their devices and honestly I'm running out of ideas.

Setting it to false in the sample does indeed \"fix\" the issue, i.e. the context isn't lost, but without having a fullScreen app.\r\n\r\n[EDIT2]: I just found out that the reason why my code was loosing the context and yours weren't is that I was setting in my code the `stage.displayState = StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN_INTERACTIVE`. After adding it into your code, it also loses context.\r\n\r\nRegards,","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/942/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/941","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/941/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/941/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/941/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/941","id":203451064,"number":941,"title":"EventDispatcher: try to avoid creating a duplicate Vector.<Function> in removeEventListener","user":{"login":"joshtynjala","id":141885,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/141885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala","html_url":"https://github.com/joshtynjala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":130317,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-01-26T18:29:54Z","updated_at":"2017-01-27T08:05:37Z","closed_at":"2017-01-27T08:00:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pulls/941","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/941","diff_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/941.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/941.patch"},"body":"Hey, Daniel! As you know, removeEventListener() creates a copy of the Vector.&lt;Function&gt; that contains every listener for a certain event type. This is to ensure that events currently being dispatched will reach all listeners that were added at the time of the dispatchEvent() call. Removing a listener should only affect future dispatchEvent() calls.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's necessary to create a duplicate Vector.&lt;Function&gt; every time that removeEventListener() is called, though. If an event is not currently being dispatched, there should be no risk from modifying the original Vector.&lt;Function&gt; directly.\r\n\r\nMy proposed optimization is to keep a stack of event types currently being dispatched. If the event type passed to removeEventListener() is in the stack, Starling will create a duplicate Vector.&lt;Function&gt;, just like it does today. If the event type is not in the stack, no duplicate is created and the original Vector.&lt;Function&gt; is modified directly.\r\n\r\nI've included a screenshot of the Deallocations view in Scout. I was running the Feathers Components Explorer example, and I simply navigated back and forth between the main menu screen and a screen containing a GroupedList component several times.\r\n\r\n![deallocations](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/141885/22343840/7bdc436c-e3ae-11e6-9e3a-76ff37cda31a.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe top half of the screenshot shows Starling's current behavior where a duplicate Vector.&lt;Function&gt; is created every time. The bottom half shows my modified version of EventDispatcher that modifies the original Vector.&lt;Function&gt;, if possible.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, Vector.&lt;Function&gt; started out as the second most deallocated object in my test. After my modifications, less than half the number of Vector.&lt;Function&gt; instances were deallocated, and it dropped below Array to third place.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/941/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/940","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/940/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/940/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/940/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/940","id":202214597,"number":940,"title":"Texture is not fully uploaded visually when async callback is called","user":{"login":"joshtynjala","id":141885,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/141885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala","html_url":"https://github.com/joshtynjala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":64488856,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/labels/Bug%20in%20Flash/AIR","name":"Bug in Flash/AIR","color":"5319e7","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-01-20T18:51:58Z","updated_at":"2017-01-24T11:38:57Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey, Daniel!

A quick test on a higher end Android phone that I had handy didn't have the progressive loading, but I think I could see the texture change all at once a moment after the button alpha changes.

When reusing the texture, I had hoped to set visible to false before the upload so that the old texture wouldn't be rendered. Then, I'd set visible back to true in the async callback. However, since the async callback seems to be happening too early, I'm not sure what to do.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/940/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/939","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/939/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/939/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/939/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/939","id":199895546,"number":939,"title":"Stencil Masks not working with AIR 24.0","user":{"login":"inovento","id":13833024,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13833024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/inovento","html_url":"https://github.com/inovento","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inovento/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inovento/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inovento/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inovento/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inovento/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inovento/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inovento/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inovento/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inovento/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":64488856,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/labels/Bug%20in%20Flash/AIR","name":"Bug in Flash/AIR","color":"5319e7","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":13,"created_at":"2017-01-10T18:17:20Z","updated_at":"2017-06-24T17:44:02Z","closed_at":"2017-06-24T17:44:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello,\r\nWhen compiling with AIR 24.0 the stencil masks are no longer functional even though the depthAndStencil flag=true is still present in the application descriptor.

I looked into it and found that the bubble chain of the event seems to be 'old'. \r\nI add an element way up the display list when the user taps it, think of an image that comes forward into 'fullscreen mode' after tapping it. Tapping it again still gets me touch events on the image's old parent (and its parent and so on) even though it's now under the image.\r\n \r\nI assume that the problem lies in the target setter of the Touch class, i guess for performance reasons the bubbleChain in a Touch object will not be updated when the target remains the same:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        public function set target(value:DisplayObject):void\r\n        {\r\n            if (_target != value)\r\n            {\r\n                _target = value;\r\n                updateBubbleChain();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can lead to unwanted behaviour if you add a DisplayObject to a different parent and the touch target is still the same because the bubbleChain does not update accordingly. This can even occur after releasing the touch and touching/clicking again because Touch objects seem to be cached in a pool.\r\n\r\nYet at Touch.clone() - which gets called for all touches at every frame - the updateBubbleChain method gets called anyway, because the _target for the new touch instance is null:\r\n```\r\n        public function clone():Touch\r\n        {\r\n            var clone:Touch = new Touch(_id);\r\n            ...\r\n            clone.target = _target;\r\n            return clone;\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suggest updating the bubbleChain in the TouchProcessor no matter the target and removing the updateBubbleChain method from the target setter in the Touch class.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/935","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/935/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/935/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/935/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/935","id":196272690,"number":935,"title":"initialized helper matrix to reduce allocations","user":{"login":"bwhiting","id":3469831,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3469831?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwhiting","html_url":"https://github.com/bwhiting","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwhiting/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwhiting/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwhiting/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwhiting/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwhiting/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwhiting/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwhiting/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwhiting/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwhiting/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-12-18T12:19:19Z","updated_at":"2016-12-19T07:09:57Z","closed_at":"2016-12-19T07:08:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pulls/935","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/935","diff_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/935.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/935.patch"},"body":"Noticed a number of Matrix3D allocations in filters and thought this should have been initialized.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/935/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/934","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/934/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/934/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/934/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/934","id":194584976,"number":934,"title":"AssetManager, getTextures, wrong sorting (now only alphabetic, need to be alphabetic/numeric)","user":{"login":"raduev","id":12607219,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/12607219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raduev","html_url":"https://github.com/raduev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raduev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raduev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raduev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raduev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raduev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raduev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raduev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raduev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raduev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2016-12-09T12:26:58Z","updated_at":"2016-12-12T11:21:24Z","closed_at":"2016-12-09T12:41:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"if i have resources image_1 ... image_14,\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar out:Vector.<String> = new <String>[];\r\nfor (var u:Number = 1;

Decrement `_stateStackPos` outside of for-loop\r\n\r\nThat way you don't need to call `Painter.pushState` every time before rendering child objects, and will help in improving the performance of `DisplayObjectContainer` which has many child objects.\r\nI've tried this in my repo and seems to be working fine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/920/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/919","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/919/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/919/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/919/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/919","id":186955770,"number":919,"title":"Write access to Sprite3D's transformationMatrix3D property","user":{"login":"Binklebonk","id":16984998,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/16984998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Binklebonk","html_url":"https://github.com/Binklebonk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Binklebonk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Binklebonk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Binklebonk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Binklebonk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Binklebonk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Binklebonk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Binklebonk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Binklebonk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Binklebonk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-11-03T00:32:24Z","updated_at":"2016-11-04T16:10:50Z","closed_at":"2016-11-03T11:10:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi Daniel.
