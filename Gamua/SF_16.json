I have performance problems. So I'm looking for a way to decrease render calls and matrix transformations.\n\nI'm trying to use flatten: cpu usage decreases by 20%, but number of draw-calles increases from 39 to 214. I have tried to change the following method of Sprite:\n\n``` as3\npublic override function render(support:RenderSupport, parentAlpha:Number):void  {\n            // some code\n            if (mFlattenedContents || mFlattenRequested)\n            {\n                if (mFlattenedContents == null)\n                    mFlattenedContents = new <QuadBatch>[];                \n                if (mFlattenRequested)\n                {\n                    QuadBatch.compile(this, mFlattenedContents);\n                    support.applyClipRect(); // compiling filters might change scissor rect. :-\\\n                    mFlattenRequested = false;\n                }                \n                var alpha:Number = parentAlpha * this.alpha;\n                var numBatches:int = mFlattenedContents.length;\n                var mvpMatrix:Matrix = support.mvpMatrix;\n// following 2 lines are removed, not finish prev batch                \n                // support.finishQuadBatch();\n                // support.raiseDrawCount(numBatches);                \n                for (var i:int=0; i<numBatches; ++i)\n                {\n                    var quadBatch:QuadBatch = mFlattenedContents[i];\n                    var blendMode:String = quadBatch.blendMode == BlendMode.AUTO ?\n                        support.blendMode : quadBatch.blendMode;\n// remove render-custom\n                        // quadBatch.renderCustom(mvpMatrix, alpha, blendMode);\n// add this line instead\n            support.batchQuadBatch(quadBatch, parentAlpha);\n                }\n            }\n            // some code\n        }\n```\n\nThis code keeps decreasing the CPU usage and keeps draw-calls low.\nI know that \"batchQuadBatch\" is not the best option. So I am thinking on a way to replace quadBatch vector with quad vector, that could be quicker.\n\nPS \nThe best thing I can dream off is to stop rendering some display-object completely: no render, not upload-vector buffer, no calculating triangles, but keep them on the screen frozen. The weakest point of starling is that it has no dirty-checks (to my mind), so it would be great to have \"freeze\" option.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/551","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/551/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/551/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/551/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/551","id":34455257,"number":551,"title":"QuadBatch not visible","user":{"login":"Xelat84","id":2535519,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2535519?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xelat84","html_url":"https://github.com/Xelat84","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xelat84/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xelat84/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xelat84/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xelat84/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xelat84/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xelat84/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xelat84/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xelat84/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xelat84/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48336470,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/labels/Waiting","name":"Waiting","color":"eb6420","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-05-28T10:51:02Z","updated_at":"2014-11-17T13:30:32Z","closed_at":"2014-11-17T13:30:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I used a QuadBatch made of parts of a single texture 1024x1024.

would suggest to use composition for MovieClip instead of directly extending Image so we can re-use the logic for advancing, looping, events.. while using another rendering method than just switching

one of theses in the MovieClip.\nThat way, we could create another Animated display object easily without rewriting a bunch of

patch allows a user to upload custom mipmaps to be used for a texture. Custom mipmaps are useful when creating textures that render different content depending on the resolution it is being drawn. In my own case, I'm using textures with custom mipmaps to simulate lines with a uniform thickness: whatever the texture of my quad, the lines drawn on it have the same thickness. Such a solution is best used when combined with trilinear filtering, since it interpolates the texture between different mimap levels.\n\nThis patch doesn't break compatibility with the current version of Starling. It adds two new methods:\n\n`Texture.fromBitmapDatas(datas:Array of BitmapData)`\nand\n`<ConcreteTexture>.uploadBitmapDatas(datas:Array of BitmapData, optimizeForRenderToTexture:Boolean=false, scale:Number=1, format:String=\"bgra\", repeat:Boolean=false)`\n\nIt also changes `<ConcreteTexture>.uploadBitmapData()` to call `<ConcreteTexture>.uploadBitmapDatas()` to avoid duplicating code.\n\nIn a nutshell, the new `uploadBitmapDatas()` works the same way as the old `uploadBitmapData()`. The difference is that it uses the first BitmapData instance in the array as the main texture, and subsequent instances as mipmap levels for it. It would work like this:\n\n`var texture:Texture = Texture.fromBitmapDatas([bitmap256x256, bitmap128x128, bitmap64x64, ...]);`\n\nIt continues using bitmaps (it assumes each subsequent bitmap is half the resolution of the previous) until there's no more bitmapdatas available. When this happens, it falls back to resizing the last image and using it as the next mipmap level (again, similar to what the original `uploadBitmapData()` does).\n\nI'm open to suggestions of a different interface. I have been using this patch on a current project and it plays well with normal Starling content.\n\nOther details:\n- This patch does not make any attempt to hook into the asset manager and allow upload of bitmaps for separate mipmap levels. I don't use the AssetManager that much and I don't think I'd come up with the ideal interface for it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/537/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/536","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/536/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/536/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/536/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/536","id":32533526,"number":536,"title":"juggler.delayCall cannot be reset properly","user":{"login":"lagoonSoft","id":7019663,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7019663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagoonSoft","html_url":"https://github.com/lagoonSoft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagoonSoft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagoonSoft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagoonSoft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagoonSoft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagoonSoft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagoonSoft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagoonSoft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagoonSoft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagoonSoft/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-04-30T13:17:41Z","updated_at":"2014-05-01T18:13:56Z","closed_at":"2014-05-01T05:50:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, we cannot use **juggler.delayCall()** and keep the **DelayedCall** created and use **reset()** on it.

lower than `0.5` and they'd be off the screen.\n\n2 things would fix it:\n\n**1) Applying an offset when calling `setOrthographicProjection()`**\nThis needs to be separated between desktop (only tested on windows though) and mobile (maybe using `SystemUtil`?).\n\nWhen setting up the `RenderSupport`:\n\n```\nvar scale:Number    = 0.5;\nvar w:Number        = Starling.current.stage.stageWidth;\nvar h:Number        = Starling.current.stage.stageHeight;\nvar bmd:BitmapData  = new BitmapData( w * scale, h * scale, false, 0x00000000 );\n\n// create our render support\nvar rs:RenderSupport = new RenderSupport;\nif( SystemUtil.isDesktop )\n    rs.setOrthographicProjection( 0.0, 0.0, w * 1.0 / scale, h * 1.0 / scale);\nelse\n    rs.setOrthographicProjection( 0.0, ( h - ( h * 1.0 / scale ) ), w * 1.0 / scale, h * 1.0 / scale);\n```\n\nThe `w * 1.0 / scale` and `h * 1.0 / scale` is there to fix the `clipRect` problem mentioned in #517\n\nThe `y` offset for the orthographic projection is needed, as if the `RenderSupport.renderTarget` is `null`, it'll render in the back buffer. Why it's necessary to correct the offset only for mobile, and only for the `y` axis is beyond me :smile: \n\n**2) Use a `renderTarget` for the `RenderSupport`**:\nIf the `renderTarget` is `null`, then it's rendered into the back buffer, so you can specify an empty target instead:\n\n```\nvar scale:Number    = 0.5;\nvar w:Number        = Starling.current.stage.stageWidth;\nvar h:Number        = Starling.current.stage.stageHeight;\nvar bmd:BitmapData  = new BitmapData( w * scale, h * scale, false, 0x00000000 );\n\n// create our render support\nvar rs:RenderSupport    = new RenderSupport;\nrs.renderTarget         = new RenderTexture( w * scale, h * scale, false, 0 );\nrs.setOrthographicProjection( 0.0, 0.0, w, h );\n```\n\nIf we use a `RenderTexture`, then we don't have to set the `width` and `height` fix for the `clipRects` in the `setOrthographicProjection` call, though I'm not sure it's possible to get the resulting texture as a `BitmapData`? Only the `Context3D` class seems to have a `drawToBitmapData()` method.\n\n---\n\nIn an somewhat related note, I found that calling `Starling.current.context.present()` at the end of all this to actually _cause_ a flicker rather than prevent one, when using the first fix, as, because you're rendering to the back buffer, it'll show one frame (the one you just rendered) with the scale messed up. \n\nYou can either omit the call, or _re-render_ the stage at scale `1.0`. Something like this:\n\n```\n...\nStarling.current.context.drawToBitmapData( bmd );\n\n// re-render at 100% scale to avoid a screen flicker\nrs.setOrthographicProjection( 0, 0.0, w, h );\nrs.clear( this.stage.color );\nstage.render( rs, 1.0 );\nrs.finishQuadBatch();\n\nStarling.current.context.present(); // required on some platforms to avoid flickering\n```\n\nThis obviously has a downside of rendering twice just to get a screenshot.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/525/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/524","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/524/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/524/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/524/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/524","id":31452111,"number":524,"title":" Error #3605 after the context restore with the Starling when using ATF texture on Android devices","user":{"login":"SlavomirDurej","id":4057817,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4057817?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlavomirDurej","html_url":"https://github.com/SlavomirDurej","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlavomirDurej/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlavomirDurej/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlavomirDurej/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlavomirDurej/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlavomirDurej/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlavomirDurej/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlavomirDurej/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlavomirDurej/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlavomirDurej/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":64488856,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/labels/Bug%20in%20Flash/AIR","name":"Bug in Flash/AIR","color":"5319e7","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2014-04-14T11:03:24Z","updated_at":"2014-04-15T08:31:04Z","closed_at":"2014-04-15T06:49:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Created very simple example that can easily replicate this issue :\nhttps://github.com/SlavomirDurej/starlinglostcontexbug/tree/master\n\nAll I'm doing is loading a spritesheet in ATF format, and adding an image from it on the screen :\n\n``` as3\nprivate function displayLoadedObj() : void\n{\n    var texture : Texture = assetManager.getTexture(\"Ring\");\n    var img : Image = new Image(texture);\n    img.x = 1;\n    img.y = 1;\n    this.addChild(img);\n}\n```\n\n(https://github.com/SlavomirDurej/starlinglostcontexbug/blob/master/src/com/durej/lostcontextbug/Main.as)\n\nSo shortly after starting the app, an image of a ring will appear on the screen.
