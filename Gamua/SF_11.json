One extra variable in the Touch.as class, perhaps being \"interrupted:Boolean\" ( default: false ).\n\nThen I believe the onInterruption function will set this variable to true in this little code block:\n\n``` as3\n{\n        touch.phase = TouchPhase.ENDED;\n        touch.interrupted = true;\n}\n```\n\nyou will know better than me where it will be then be reset back to false, but I'm assuming it would be here:\n\n``` as3\n// dispatch events\nprocessTouches(mCurrentTouches, mShiftDown, mCtrlDown);\nif (mCurrentTouches.length > 0)\n{\n        // reset interruption on all touches\n        for each (var touch:Touch in mCurrentTouches)\n        {\n            touch.interrupted = false;\n        }\n}\n```\n\nNow I believe if this is all correct so far, an example use case of the new changes would be as follows:\n\n``` as3\npublic function touchEnded( x_:Number , y_:Number , interrupted_:Boolean = false ):void \n{\n        if ( true == interrupted_ ) \n        {\n            //do interrupted stuff, in my case, reset actions to a default state, \n            //as if the initial Touch never took place\n\n            return; // this maybe useful, to skip the code below ( below code being normal touchEnded calls\n            //do default touchEnded things if the 'touch' was not interrupted\n        }\n}\n```\n\nWell anyway, thanks for a great framework.

It has other package name com.adobe.utils.v3.\n\nOr may be our problem is same as this issue https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/676\n\nList of devices (form google dev console):\nGalaxy Tab4 7.0 (degas3g)\nGalaxy Tab2 10.1 (espresso10rf)\nGalaxy S Advance (GT-I9070)\nGalaxy Tab3 Lite (goya3g)\nASUS Fonepad ME371MG (ME371MG)\nGalaxy Tab3 7.0 (lt023g)\nMediaPad 7 Lite (hws7930u)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/694","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/694/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/694/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/694/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/694","id":63908947,"number":694,"title":"Starling in JavaScript","user":{"login":"bpq","id":11624966,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/11624966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpq","html_url":"https://github.com/bpq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpq/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-03-24T05:41:59Z","updated_at":"2015-05-11T08:35:05Z","closed_at":"2015-05-11T08:35:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"How difficult would it be to port this to JavaScript?

Daniel,\n\ni have a question about sub textures and scaling. let's say, i have a texture atlas with some small (62x62px) \"565\" packed textures on a pink background padded by 1 pixel.\n\nin the Starling root Sprite, Image classes are used to arrange the sub-textures.\nthe Starling stage is constant while the viewport just scales to make a fit on the Native stage (e.g. via RectangleUtil.fit(), not pixel perfect).\n\nEDIT: i should probably add that in my test the Starling stage is bigger than the viewport.\n\nwhat i'm observing when dragging the edge of the projector window to reduce it, is pink contours appearing at the edges of the Image elements. what i assume is that this is probably unavoidable due to sub-pixel scaling. could i attempt to somehow round the size of viewPort to prevent that?\n\nthe strange part is that if i use the pixel perfect scale in RectangleUtil.fit() on the stage and animate said Image elements the pink contours start appearing again.\n\nif you want, i can possibly (hopefully) reproduce that in a demo project and post it here?\n\nAIR 16.0.0.292, a very recent Starling from

Sometimes, I want to do something between Starling initializing and the root display object being created. Especially if I need multiple NativeWindows in AIR desktop.\n\nThere is precedence to creating a stage without a root in the native display list. In AIR, when you create a NativeWindow, it has a stage, but no root. If I were to wrap NativeWindow in a Feathers component, it would make sense to offer the same experience.\n\nIn my plans to support MXML in Feathers, I'd like to have a main application class that abstracts Starling initialization. It would be ideal if I could set up a Feathers theme before the root is created so that the root can be a Feathers component. It's technically possible now, but it requires manual work for developers that I would  rather abstract away.\n\nIn my implementation, I made the following changes:\n\n1) The rootClass parameter in the constructor may be set to null. initializeRoot() checks for this new possibility.\n\n2) I added a root setter that can accept a display object. If a root already exists, it will be removed and disposed. If Starling hasn't fully initialized, the new root will be saved until initializeRoot() is called. In initializeRoot(), the saved root will it be added to the stage, and Event.ROOT_CREATED will be dispatched. If the root setter is used after initializeRoot() has been called, the new root is immediately added to the stage without an event.\n\nThe normal case of passing a valid rootClass to the constructor should behave exactly the same.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/687/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/686","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/686/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/686/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/686/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/686","id":59651226,"number":686,"title":"Updating

Starling objects native Flash textures do not remove their event listeners when texture is being disposed. Calling 'ConcreteTexture::dispose' right after 'ConcreteTexture::uploadAtfData' leaves Starling- and Flash- texture objects referencing each other which is increasing cost of garbage collection as these two objects can not be GC'ed during reference counting phase. This can even lead to a memory leak. Second possible problem related to this issue is async callback triggering on a disposed texture which can introduce unexpected behavior in application.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/677/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/676","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/676/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/676/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/676/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/676","id":57472451,"number":676,"title":"Uncaught ArgumentError: Error #3672 at starling.display::QuadBatch/createBuffers()","user":{"login":"neuronix","id":219800,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/219800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neuronix","html_url":"https://github.com/neuronix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neuronix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neuronix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neuronix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neuronix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neuronix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neuronix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neuronix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neuronix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neuronix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":64488856,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/labels/Bug%20in%20Flash/AIR","name":"Bug in Flash/AIR","color":"5319e7","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":130,"created_at":"2015-02-12T15:13:06Z","updated_at":"2016-05-10T08:03:11Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\n\nThis error is a nightmare.
