not sure how much work this is, or even if it's feasible, but if you don't ask you don't get :)\n\nWe use a lot of quads in our game to store as bgs etc, but sometimes, due to size errors (e.g. you use a quad as a bg for a Feathers Label, but when you create it, it might not be properly validated yet, so the width/height returns 0), it's created with a width and/or height of 0, resulting in a runtime error.\n\nFrom what I can tell, Starling already supports display objects with no visible area, so would it be possible to add a Quad to this, if either the width or height is 0? It saves a lot of boilerplate `if( width == 0 ) width = 1` code checks everywhere (assuming that they _are_ everywhere)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/556","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/556/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/556/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/556/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/556","id":34737485,"number":556,"title":"AssetManager: Loading atlas XML without texture data","user":{"login":"Varnius","id":1571003,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1571003?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Varnius","html_url":"https://github.com/Varnius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Varnius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Varnius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Varnius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Varnius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Varnius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Varnius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Varnius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Varnius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Varnius/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":130317,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2014-06-01T21:39:20Z","updated_at":"2017-09-20T08:23:55Z","closed_at":"2014-06-04T17:38:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Would be handy if AssetManager could load atlas XML data even without enqueued texture data.
