I think, that’s usual approach for Starling Facebook games.\nThe problem is that some of our users are getting errors like that sometimes:\nArgumentError: Error #3672: Buffer creation failed. Internal error.\nat flash.display3D::Context3D/createVertexBuffer()\nat starling.display::QuadBatch/createBuffers()\nat starling.display::QuadBatch/syncBuffers()\nat starling.display::QuadBatch/renderCustom()\n...\nwhich are thrown from random QuadBatches. And for some reason before this change quite a lot of such errors were thrown from drawToBitmapData function. It means, that rendering into bitmap works much worse than usual render for some reason, taking into account, that it happens let’s say once per 10 minutes, and render happens every frame. Probably that’s because buffers are reused in usual rendering.\nIn this change I reused Starling’s render support object.\nDocumentation states: “Buffer Creation Failed: if the VertexBuffer3D object could not be created by the rendering context (but additional information about the reason is not available).” So it’s not completely clear for me, why this error happens, but after this change it’s very likely, that new vertex and index buffers won’t be created at all during stage drawing into bitmap. It means twice less GPU memory usage for vertex and index buffers and speed up of the function as there is no need to create them.\nAlso current implementation doesn’t dispose RenderSupport object created, which can cause GPU memory leaks. And it’s not needed after the change.\nThe change also includes context validity check, if context isn’t valid, function won’t crash, but will return empty bitmap.\nAlso it will try to reconfigure back buffer, if it’s needed.\nThe thing, I’m not sure about is using mClippedViewPort for setProjectionMatrix’s parameters instead of stage, this way it should render only visible stage part, if I’m not mistaken. It seems to me, that it’s more correct behaviour, but I’m not sure.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/638/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/637","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/637/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/637/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/637/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/637","id":47623556,"number":637,"title":"RenderSupport.clear() is slow","user":{"login":"divillysausages","id":179882,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/179882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/divillysausages","html_url":"https://github.com/divillysausages","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divillysausages/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divillysausages/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divillysausages/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divillysausages/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divillysausages/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divillysausages/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divillysausages/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divillysausages/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divillysausages/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":130317,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-11-03T17:56:00Z","updated_at":"2014-11-04T09:52:06Z","closed_at":"2014-11-04T09:52:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm doing some profiling on our game at the minute, as one of the things that stood out was the `Context3D.clear()` call.

Starling.context.clear(\n        Color.getRed(rgb)   / 255.0, \n        Color.getGreen(rgb) / 255.0, \n        Color.getBlue(rgb)  / 255.0,\n        alpha);\n}\n```\n\nChanging it quickly to `Starling.context.clear(0,0,0,1)``dropped the total time spent in``clear()`` from ~380ms to ~34ms, or about 10% of the original (full disclosure: it's a debug build testing on Android).\n\nPerhaps we could just directly declare the red, green, blue rather than calculating them each time?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/636","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/636/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/636/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/636/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/636","id":47182067,"number":636,"title":"Improve

Since I wanted the extension to work with regular Starling objects like Quad and Image without breaking batching, my only option was to modify QuadBatch and fork Starling to do so because currently there is no way to override the default QuadBatch. \n\nSo what about adding a possibility for a developer to configure an instance of Starling to use a custom QuadBatch class which could simply be required to be a subclass with overridden functionality (because introducing an IQuadBatch interface would require much more work, I suppose)? Internally, this would require to replace all instances of:\n\n``` actionscript\nnew QuadBatch()\n```\n\nwith a factory call like\n\n``` actionscript\nQuadBatchFactory.getInstance()\n```\n\nwhich would return an instance of custom QuadBatch class if it's specified or default QuadRenderer otherwise.\n\nI personally don't see any serious performance (or other) implications but I may be missing something, for example, compatibility with other extensions, like Feathers, where QuadBatch objects would be initialized using \"new\".\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/618","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/618/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/618/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/618/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/618","id":44064035,"number":618,"title":"Fix
