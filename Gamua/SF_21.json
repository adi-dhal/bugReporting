Since flash.events.Event has properties that starling.events.EventDispatcher cannot change, it must throw a runtime error if it receives an argument that isn't a starling.events.Event or a subclass of it. Similar to the items above, I feel that a note in the documentation should clear things up if the runtime error isn't clear enough.\n\nThe following new features have been added:\n\n1) Events may be cancelable. I added a cancelable argument at the end of the constructor, fromPool() function and reset() function. preventDefault() and isDefaultPrevented() are also implemented. dispatchEvent() and dispatchEventWith() return a Boolean to indicate if the event was cancelled, since IEventDispatcher defines that in the signature for dispatchEvent().\n\n2) I exposed the eventPhase getter to indicate if its \"at target\" or bubbling.\n\n3) Events are not cloned when they bubble, but starling.events.Event overrides the clone() function properly. I've heard that some people like to call clone() to redispatch events sometimes, so it makes sense to have it implemented since flash.events.Event defines it.\n\nThis change offers the following additional advantages:\n\n1) Unless they specifically need to reference a property of starling.events.Event that isn't on flash.events.Event (that's only the data property, and there's a good solution for accessing that without importing starling.events.Event), people can simply import flash.events.Event most of the time, which gets rid of the requirement to use the fully-qualified class names when flash.events.Event is needed with other dispatchers in the same class. This is probably the most common class name conflict with native Flash classes, so it should actually help a lot.\n\nEvent listeners can simply accept flash.events.Event instead of starling.events.Event. If someone needs the data property, they can use the two-argument signature on their listeners:\n\n```\nfunction listener(event:Event, data:Object):void\n```\n\nThe data argument can be strongly typed too, so it's better than calling the data getter on the event since that's always typed as Object.\n\nFor dispatching pooled events with dispatchEventWith(), the type constants on flash.events.Event work just as well as the constants on starling.events.Event since they're simply Strings. There shouldn't be any reason to call dispatchEvent() with a starling.events.Event, since you lose the advantages of pooling, so no one should need to import starling.events.Event for that either.\n\nIf someone continues to import starling.events.Event in new or existing code, it will continue to work the same way as before. That change won't break anything, and new code can benefit from importing flash.events.Event instead.\n\n2) Starling and Feathers will work better in MXML since MXML requires IEventDispatcher to use some of its important features.\n\nI feel like advantage 1 is the big one, but advantage 2 will make many Feathers users happy.\n\nThis should not break most existing code. If someone overrides addEventListener(), removeEventListener(), dispatchEvent(), or dispatchEventWith(), they will need to change the signature. I do this in a couple of places in Feathers, but it's an easy change. I doubt that many other people are adding overrides as such a low level.\n\nWhat do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/393","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/393/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/393/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/393/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/393","id":19552756,"number":393,"title":"TextField exception : Error #2015: Invalid BitmapData","user":{"login":"soywiz","id":570848,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/570848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soywiz","html_url":"https://github.com/soywiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soywiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soywiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soywiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soywiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soywiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soywiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soywiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soywiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soywiz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-09-16T14:14:55Z","updated_at":"2013-09-16T16:48:04Z","closed_at":"2013-09-16T16:47:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"https://github.com/PrimaryFeather/Starling-Framework/blob/master/starling/src/starling/text/TextField.as#L277\n\n``` as3\nrenderText:var bitmapData:BitmapData = new BitmapData(width, height, true, 0x0);\n```\n\nIn some cases width and/or height are 0: new TextField(1, 1, '');

(That recently came up with a 2.5D Filter, ... I know, bad idea ... but will also be an issue with the BloomFilter I had in mind)\n\nUnfortunately overriding is not working well, since a lot of private variables/functions are used in your render/renderPasses functions. My workaround was disposing the filter right in the subclass's constructor and adding almost a complete copy of the FragmentFilter super class to my subclass, which is obviously bad. But I couldn't find a better way to make it work without customizing starling, which would make the filters useless for others.\n\nSo I'd like to ask whether you could implement a IFragmentFilter interface to Starling 1.4 or at least change the private functions/vars to protected, which would also be working, but as I guess be less efficient. What ever you like best. That would be really awesome.\n\nThanks in advance\n\nMichael\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/391/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/390","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/390/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/390/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/390/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/390","id":19057146,"number":390,"title":"Resetting of index and vertex data implemented","user":{"login":"hamidhomatash","id":1932138,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1932138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamidhomatash","html_url":"https://github.com/hamidhomatash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamidhomatash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamidhomatash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamidhomatash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamidhomatash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamidhomatash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamidhomatash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamidhomatash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamidhomatash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamidhomatash/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-09-05T17:06:13Z","updated_at":"2014-06-24T19:36:50Z","closed_at":"2013-09-13T13:13:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pulls/390","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/390","diff_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/390.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/390.patch"},"body":"In the dispose call the index and vertex data is now reset.

is a minor feature request to possibly add in the future, but inspired by the idea of trying to implement 'packed' BitmapFonts as described and shown in the video here:\n\nhttp://forum.starling-framework.org/topic/does-starling-bitmapfont-not-support-bmfonts-multiple-channel-feature\n\nOne obvious core feature to consider supporting this might be to add an optional\n'channelMask' property to starling.display.DisplayObject\nwhich would offer the values:\nChannelMask.NONE (default)\nChannelMask.RED\nChannelMask.GREEN\nChannelMask.BLUE\nChannelMask.ALPHA\n\nwhich would essential filter/mask activate only the rendering of a specific channel of a texture during rendering. \nI would think this would work just like all the other state change checks meaning that a single state could be batched as long as objects share the same channel mask property.\n(not sure if a bitmask and multiple channels active at a time would work or be beneficial either...)\n\nOne could imagine this being the only required 'internal' feature of Starling for someone to implement the packed per-channel BitmapFont data as implemented.\n\nCould this end up being a fairly minimal impact addition if everyone current was just using the default ChannelMask.NONE?\n\nBesdies packed BitmapFont usage, could there be other benefits and uses of packing data within individual channels of a texture and selectively activating only certain channels during rendering?\n\nJust an idea and feature I wanted to throw out there if it were relatively easy to add to Starling and its AGAL uses.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/374/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/373","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/373/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/373/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/373/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/373","id":17437796,"number":373,"title":"BGRA_PACKED
