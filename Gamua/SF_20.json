I found a memory leak in the RenderTexture Class. Generally the rule is you should never use dynamic function calls as they eat up memory and have to each be dynamically created.\n\nNow personally i thought that this had been updated in recent versions of flash but apparently it has not.\n\nReproduction use drawBundled() function to draw a couple hundred objects to the world. (I've also seen it occur with even 5 objects though hundred is more apparent) now watch your memory climb.\n\nThe reason this is such a big problem is b/c every time the system on both pc and mobile clears away the junk memory the frames drop drastically. (on 30 fps game drops to 24) now that stutter ruins the entire gameplay.\n\nWhy i want you guys to fix this is b/c i like using the vanilla starling i don't want to have to make any changes to the engine and i want to be able to get the latest build without having to worry about custom code so it would appreciated if you fix this.\n\nProblem Code:\n\n<pre lang=\"as3\">\npublic function draw(object:DisplayObject, matrix:Matrix=null, alpha:Number=1.0,\n                             antiAliasing:int=0):void\n        {\n            if (object == null) return;\n \n            if (mDrawing)\n                render();\n            else\n                drawBundled(render, antiAliasing);\n \n            function render():void\n            {\n                mSupport.loadIdentity();\n                mSupport.blendMode = object.blendMode;\n \n                if (matrix) mSupport.prependMatrix(matrix);\n                else        mSupport.transformMatrix(object);\n \n                object.render(mSupport, alpha);\n            }\n        }\n</pre>\n\nMy Fix:\n\n<pre lang=\"as3\">\npublic function draw(object:DisplayObject, matrix:Matrix=null, alpha:Number=1.0,\n                             antiAliasing:int=0):void\n        {\n            if (object == null) return;\n \n            if (mDrawing)\n                render(object,matrix,alpha,antiAliasing);\n            //else\n                //drawBundled(render, antiAliasing);\n \n        }\n        //Fixed Memory Leak\nprivate function render(object:DisplayObject, matrix:Matrix=null, alpha:Number=1.0,\n                             antiAliasing:int=0):void\n        {\n            mSupport.loadIdentity();\n            mSupport.blendMode = object.blendMode;\n \n            if (matrix) mSupport.prependMatrix(matrix);\n            else        mSupport.transformMatrix(object);\n \n            object.render(mSupport, alpha);\n        }\n</pre>\n\nNow i know this only works for batch drawing the only way i could theoretically see around it is separate render calls for the non-batched draw should cache store vars temporarily and then use them in separate function call. Clear the cache at the end of the drawBatch Call if there is one...\n\nFeedback is always welcome.\nI thank you for your attention.\n\nA confirmation that it's been fixed would also be nice.\n\nBNNS \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/416","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/416/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/416/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/416/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/416","id":21569650,"number":416,"title":"TextField cannot rende unicode text with numbers in it","user":{"login":"ehudros","id":48473,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/48473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehudros","html_url":"https://github.com/ehudros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehudros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehudros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehudros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehudros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehudros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehudros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehudros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehudros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehudros/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2013-10-25T04:48:42Z","updated_at":"2014-04-25T10:48:36Z","closed_at":"2014-04-25T10:48:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello,\nI'm seeing a strange issue with textfields using embedded fonts.\nI'm trying to render the following text in Japanese: レベル.\nThis shows up well when using an embedded font like this:\n\n``` as3\n[Embed(source = \"../assets/fonts/impact.ttf\", advancedAntiAliasing=\"true\",fontName = \"Impact\", fontFamily=\"Impact\", embedAsCFF=\"false\", mimeType = \"application/x-font-truetype\")]\nprivate static const Impact:Class;\n\nvar LevelNameTF:TextField = new TextField(120, 20, \"レベル\", \"Impact\", 18, 0xffffff);\n```\n\nHowever, when I try to render the same text with a number in it (レベル 9) only the number shows up and the japanese characters are removed.

we all know, memory is precious, especially GPU memory.As I am trying to develop MovieClips using Starling, through SpriteSheets/TextureAtlases, I seem to run into a problem with tightening up my Atlases.\n\nWhen I play a MovieClip, it seems to get very angry if the texture atlas does not contain a sequence of subimages of the same size. Please Note, it is quite possible that I am doing something else wrong, not using the TextureAtlases and the MovieClip class correctly.\n\nFirst off, initially, the content of my MovieClips gets stretched if the Image (N+1) in the sequence is of a different size (lets say half of the width) than Image (N). \n\nI worked around that by subclassing the MovieClip class and overriding the \"set texture\" function, allowing me to call the Image class function \"readjustSize\" if the new texture is of a different size than the old texture.\n\nIt would be nice to hear Daniels opinion on this. \n\nWith this in place, I managed to get an animation of a rotating object (Wide in some frames, thin in some frames) to play without stretching while ensuring that the Texture Atlas does not have to have a lot of empty alpha pixels between the symbols (to make the individual subtextures are of equal width).\n\nThis saves me a lot of pixel space in the TextureAtlas, but maybe this is solved differently/better in other ways?\n\nDoes this make sense? Unfortunately, I am unable to provide the sprite sheets I'm using as they are for a upcoming game, but if my words aren't enough to explain what I mean, I'll try to provide something that helps to get this description across.\n\nThanks for reading! :)\n\nEDIT: OR, alternatively, this might just be a case of me not fully understanding the frameWidth and frameHeight values of the TextureAtlas XML... Hmm...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/412","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/412/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/412/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/412/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/412","id":21138889,"number":412,"title":"TextField htmlText support","user":{"login":"gevorg-gsar","id":2583416,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2583416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gevorg-gsar","html_url":"https://github.com/gevorg-gsar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gevorg-gsar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gevorg-gsar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gevorg-gsar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gevorg-gsar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gevorg-gsar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gevorg-gsar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gevorg-gsar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gevorg-gsar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gevorg-gsar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":130317,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2013-10-17T08:33:42Z","updated_at":"2014-11-21T10:00:53Z","closed_at":"2014-11-21T09:53:48Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pulls/412","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/412","diff_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/412.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/412.patch"},"body":"We needed htmlText support in TextField for TrueType fonts a lot.\nSo here is a small code modification will be great to see in the master branch.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/412/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/411","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/411/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/411/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/411/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/411","id":21031512,"number":411,"title":"Duplicated \"for each\" statement found in AssetManager.as","user":{"login":"william-wc","id":1434890,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1434890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/william-wc","html_url":"https://github.com/william-wc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/william-wc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/william-wc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/william-wc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/william-wc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/william-wc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/william-wc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/william-wc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/william-wc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/william-wc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-10-15T17:31:27Z","updated_at":"2013-10-16T20:12:02Z","closed_at":"2013-10-16T19:29:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"```\nelse if (rawAsset is Class) {\n    var typeXml:XML = describeType(rawAsset);\n    var childNode:XML;\n\n    if (mVerbose)\n        log(\"Looking for static embedded assets in '\" + \n            (typeXml.@name).split(\"::\").pop() + \"'\");

I have gone through the code and I cant see any difference in the output, ie the same input yields the same output.\n\nThis makes me want to cache the generated ByteArray in a Dictionary, store it with a unique identifier (maybe even the program string itself) and check for a cached version of the generated ByteArray and clone that one, instead of re-parsing the same program string in AGALMiniAssembler again and again.\n\nWhen I implemented this outside of Starling, through a variant of the BlurFilter class, the cost of creating the BlurFilters shrank dramatically.\n\nIs this a problem that others face?\n\nOf course, if applied at the correct level, it could be applied to all areas where programs are generated. For example, the code in QuadBatch.registerPrograms runs about twice as fast with the caching in place. It's a cheap method, sure, but it shows that the performance boost can be had across the board.\n\nIs this something worth digging deeper into? I wouldn't mind putting together a test case for comparison, if anyone would be interested, or I can come with some suggestions on how/where to implement it. BUt before I do anything, I'd like to hear if anyone thinks this is worth doing?\n\nThanks for a great

It is a book, and the pages are big textures. The user could move the pages fast, going to cancel the pages will not be visible.\n\nPossible solutions: \n*mAbortLoading will be checked here, but it could be a problem in my application too. \n*You can store timeoutID, and clearTimeout in purgeQueue method.\n\nKind Regards\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4748","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507250212","x-github-request-id":"D80A:572C:1668CA0:2C814EC:59D6C7D5","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/2097941/issues?state=all&page=21>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/2097941/issues?state=all&page=34>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/2097941/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/2097941/issues?state=all&page=19>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"de05c8d590e6d533efc2146d66a4b0ac\"","status":"200 OK"}}
