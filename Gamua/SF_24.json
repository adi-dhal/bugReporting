It seems that having a filtered object move on or off stage, produces flickering effect and on a less-than-high-end mobile device, the device may momentarily freeze or even crash and reboot.\n\nI've created a very small app to reproduce the problem. All it does is generate a 64x128 image, applies a glow filter (any filter will produce the same results, but it is most noticeable with glow) and moves it back and forth over the left edge of the stage. If you run this on the desktop, you can notice some flickering and minor distortion of the glow filter. If you run it on a mobile device (so far we've produced the bug on a Samsung Galaxy S, iPad 2, and iPhone 4) though, you will get very heavy distortion of the filter and flickering of the entire screen. This is a screenshot of the image as it is leaving the stage: http://onebyonedesign.com/junk/stage_intersect.png . Of course, what you can't see in the screenshot is that the app locks up at that point for a couple seconds and occasionally does not unlock and crashes the device. I've pasted the code for the small 'app' here: https://gist.github.com/devon-o/5253405 .\n\nWhat I suspect the problem is, is the excessive creation of textures as the image slides off the stage. The textures are created at the size of the rectangle that intersects with the stage and display object and then bumped to a power of two (meaning the closer the object is to the stage edge, the more often textures are generated).\n\nSo far, I've fixed the problem by replacing this bit of code in FragmentFilter.calculateBounds method:\n\nsStageBounds.setTo(0, 0, stage.stageWidth, stage.stageHeight);\nRectangleUtil.intersect(resultRect, sStageBounds, resultRect);\n\nwith this:\n\nsStageBounds.setTo(0, 0, stage.stageWidth, stage.stageHeight);\nif ( !(sStageBounds.intersects(resultRect)) )\n    resultRect.setEmpty();\n\nThis isn't an optimal solution though. It's sort of all or nothing (if the display object intersects the stage, the filter texture is the size of the disp. obj. - otherwise, the filter is removed entirely), and misses all the optimization that was supposed to be there. But this way is a start for anyone having a similar problem.\n\nIn any case, it deserves to be looked at. :)\n\nd.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/311","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/311/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/311/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/311/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/311","id":12497959,"number":311,"title":"Optimization

doing profiling with Scout, I noticed that hasEventListener and getChildEventListeners are taking a huge chunk of my CPU time, especially on iOS.\nI did some digging and with a slight change to getChildEventListeners line 385, to avoid parsing the whole tree for ENTER_FRAME:\n\n`if (container)`\nto\n`if (container && eventType != EnterFrameEvent.ENTER_FRAME)`\n\nI got a 10% performance increase on my iPhone 4.\nOf course, the drawback is that now, only the stage broadcast ENTER_FRAME, but from my quick check of feathers and starling, it's not really an issue for them (feathers just need 2 quick changes to listen to stage instead of a display object, but the rest of the code wont care).\nIn any case, since starling and feathers have no problem supporting it, it could be an opt-in flag on starling so nothing get's broken and a dev could choose to use the quick path if he wants to.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nSebastien\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/310","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/310/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/310/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/310/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/310","id":12445184,"number":310,"title":"TextField

Insertion sort doesn't have the best _theoretical_ runtime performance, but in practice it works very well for display object depth sorting: after the first sort of a given DisplayObjectContainer, subsequent sorts will generally be close to O(n) (because most displayObjects won't be out of order after just a single frame). It also does the sort in-place, so there's no extra allocations happening.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/303","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/303/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/303/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/303/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/303","id":11951623,"number":303,"title":"Add

as commented on and tested in this forum topic:\n\nhttp://forum.starling-framework.org/topic/latest-air-36-sdk-supports-mac-retina-hidpi\n\nAIR 3.6 SDK added support for hiDPI, and while they only documented the app descriptor code to turn this on, it seems one also needs to make the proper call to createBackBuffer for Context3D and pass in true to the new wantsBestResolution argument.\n\nIt does say this could affect shader code somehow, so not sure if this also requires more investigation on your part with an actual retina Mac (as well as some of the concerns Josh and I mentioned in the topic when you move the app window between hiDPI and non-retina screens related to possible context loss).\n\nI don't use any custom shaders, but would like to turn on hiDPI support with my 2x assets that I already use for retina iPads and iPhones.\n\nHopefully you will have time to officially add this and test it soon on real hardware.\n\nThanks\nJeff\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/303/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/302","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/302/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/302/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/302/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/302","id":11944381,"number":302,"title":"Optimizing
