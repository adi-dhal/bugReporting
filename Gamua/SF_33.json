from Aaron:\n\nHandle device loss. The CONTEXT3D_CREATE event could fire at any given time when the GPU context is lost (screensaver coming on, or another app taking it, or the OS itself taking it).  Starling should make this event invisible to the user so that they don’t have to re-upload all the resources manually.  Right now Starling will throw an error that Programs have already been registered, and rendering will stop.\n\nRemarks:\n\nDevice Loss: To simulate a device loss event, it is as easy as leaving the CONTEXT3D_CREATE eventListener on the stage3D, then calling context3D.dispose().  If the listener is attached when calling dispose() the event will immediately fire, simulating a device loss and device regain cycle.  To test the real thing is easy too.  On Windows all you have to do is do ctrl+alt+delete to enter the admin screen.  On Mac it's trickier, but should occur if you close the laptop lid or put the screen to sleep, or allow the screen saver to come on.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/23/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/22","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/22/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/22/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/22/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/22","id":1463869,"number":22,"title":"Allow

are some simple tips that can have a positive effect on performance:\n### for loops\n\nInstead of\n\n```\nfor (var i:int=0; i<container.numChildren; ++i)\n```\n\nit's more efficient to write\n\n```\nvar limit:uint = container.numChildren;\nfor (var i:int=0; i<limit; ++i)\n```\n\nBecause otherwise, the \"numChildren\" method will be called in every loop. \n### Array/Vector element access\n\nAs described in [this article](http://jacksondunstan.com/articles/1305), it's a good practice to cast any Vector/Array access to the expected type.\n\n```\nvar element:int = vector[3] as int;\n```\n\nFurthermore, the index operator should always be cast to int when it's the result of an operation:\n\n```\nmyArray[int(i+2)];\n```\n\nOtherwise, it might be converted to 'Number' and then back to 'int' before being used.\n### Use bitwise operations for division and multiplication by powers of 2.\n\n```\nx / 2 <=> x >> 1;\nx * 2 <=> x << 1;\n```\n### Misc\n\nUsing Fixed length vectors also helps, and to remove complex code from constructors.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/17/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/16","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/16/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/16/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/16/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/16","id":1381663,"number":16,"title":"Insert
