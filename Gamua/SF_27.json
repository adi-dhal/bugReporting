so have hacked it like this for now:\n\n```\nvar scaleX:Number = 1;//mViewPort.width  / mStage.stageWidth;\nvar scaleY:Number = 1;//mViewPort.height / mStage.stageHeight;\n```\n\nCould you please consider making the scaling optional in a future release?\n\nThanks!\nRob\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/205/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/204","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/204/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/204/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/204/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/204","id":8154359,"number":204,"title":"Object
