This is essential for certain keyCodes like Keyboard.BACK where you need to call preventDefault() to keep Android from handling the back button and leaving your app.\n\nStarling should expose this ability to cancel keyboard events. If, after broadcastEvent() returns, the new function isDefaultPrevented() returns true, preventDefault() can be called on the native event.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/365/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/364","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/364/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/364/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/364/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/364","id":16893058,"number":364,"title":"Include units more often in Tween.as ASDoc","user":{"login":"JKillian","id":1400151,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1400151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JKillian","html_url":"https://github.com/JKillian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JKillian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JKillian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JKillian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JKillian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JKillian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JKillian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JKillian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JKillian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JKillian/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2013-07-17T22:12:26Z","updated_at":"2013-07-21T19:44:12Z","closed_at":"2013-07-18T07:01:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pulls/364","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/364","diff_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/364.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/364.patch"},"body":"The ASDoc for Tween.as mentions that the times are in seconds in a few places but probably not in others where it would be helpful.

When loading multiple texture atlases, processing the xml part takes quite some time (specially with extensive xmls).

The onProgress callback is invoked as soon as the texture is loaded/added. But xmls are not processed at this point. As mentioned before, this can take quite a bit of time. I added a second parameter to the callback to indicate whether xmls are processed yet. \n\nWhat do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/343","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/343/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/343/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/343/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/343","id":15539008,"number":343,"title":"added reverse playback and \"bounce\" looping (back and forth)","user":{"login":"ericsoco","id":1127259,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1127259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericsoco","html_url":"https://github.com/ericsoco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericsoco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericsoco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericsoco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericsoco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericsoco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericsoco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericsoco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericsoco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericsoco/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":130317,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2013-06-14T01:41:23Z","updated_at":"2014-06-27T15:41:51Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pulls/343","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/343","diff_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/343.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/343.patch"},"body":"added functionality to `MovieClip` to allow reverse playback and \"bounce\" loop -- play forward and backward as a loop.\n\nboth are fully compatible with `MovieClip`'s existing features. setting `bounceLoop = true` will set `loop = false` and setting `loop = true` will set `bounceLoop = false`, since the two cannot both be true at once.  `reverse` works whether or not `loop` or `bounceLoop` are set.\n\nthere are two commits in this pull request because i implemented these changes against an out-of-date version of `MovieClip` and had to go back and reimplement them against the latest version.  better to look at the MovieClip.as diff than to look through the individual commits.\n\ni haven't tested with your unit tests as i don't have that test suite set up, but i manually tested all the permutations of `loop`, `bounceLoop`, `reverse`, and an `Event.COMPLETE` handler that i could come up with, and have been running with this code successfully for a couple of months now.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4746","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507250212","x-github-request-id":"9717:01FC:10892C3:2B1AFA1:59D6C7DD","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/2097941/issues?state=all&page=23>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/2097941/issues?state=all&page=34>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/2097941/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/2097941/issues?state=all&page=21>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"6200d89881e6ee4182ef8ccfe8f82013\"","status":"200 OK"}}
