not sure if this is considered a bug or just poor coding on my part, but this could be a potential issue for some starling users.\r\n\r\nI have been working with the Asset Manager and have kept an array of any texture/assets loaded into memory. I have discovered that, loading a bitmap font through the asset manager will actually register the bitmap font, and remove the bitmap font texture (as it's not longer needed).\r\n\r\nThe problem with this is that if I was to add that same font back in the asset manager again, it adds that bitmap font all over again, and the GPU memory of the application rises. It does not seem to remove the previous bitmap font of the same name.\r\n\r\nIs it possible that starling does not prevent re-registering fonts with identical names over and over again, or am I perhaps missing something? I changed my code to only ever add the bitmap fonts at the start of the application, instead of trying to add them whenever they may have been needed. This resolved a huge GPU memory increase as I was actually re-registering the same bitmap fonts over and over.\r\n\r\nOriginal post: https://forum.starling-framework.org/topic/accidentally-re-registering-bitmap-fonts-can-cause-gpu-memory-increase","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/989","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/989/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/989/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/989/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/989","id":245930379,"number":989,"title":"Adobe stops flash support in 2020","user":{"login":"Gargo","id":853345,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/853345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gargo","html_url":"https://github.com/Gargo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gargo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gargo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gargo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gargo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gargo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gargo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gargo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gargo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gargo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-07-27T05:34:05Z","updated_at":"2017-08-08T19:53:47Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"https://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2017/07/adobe-flash-update.html\r\n\r\ndo you plan still commit to this repository instead of for examjple Sparrow?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/989/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/988","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/988/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/988/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/988/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/988","id":244087419,"number":988,"title":"Can I get Starling.contentScaleFactorX and Starling.contentScaleFactorY?","user":{"login":"daicemirror","id":18619085,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/18619085?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daicemirror","html_url":"https://github.com/daicemirror","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daicemirror/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daicemirror/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daicemirror/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daicemirror/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daicemirror/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daicemirror/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daicemirror/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daicemirror/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daicemirror/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-07-19T15:46:49Z","updated_at":"2017-07-21T17:25:31Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"In fact, this is to solve the following issue of Feathers .\r\nhttps://github.com/BowlerHatLLC/feathers/issues/1596\r\nI can fix the feathers issue by extending the Feathers TextRender components with contentScaleFactorX and contentScaleFactorY that I calculated myself.\r\nAnd I also realize Starling does not seem to support this behavior, too.\r\nPlease give me some advice about this issue.

Daniel -\r\n\r\nHere's my situation: I need to obscure screen updates for my game for several frames while some calculations are made that update gamestate, but that the player should not be able to see.\r\n\r\nBORING BACKSTORY, FOR CONTEXT:\r\n\r\nMy original solution was to create a full-screen RenderTexture, draw the contents of the screen into it, and display that over all other content during this interval. However, occasionally this results in `Error #3691: Resource limit for this resource type exceeded.` errors. \r\n\r\nIn theory, unless I'm mistaken, this shouldn't be a big deal - my code was catching these errors immediately upon RenderTexture creation, and disposing the RenderTexture:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate function obscureScreen () :void {\r\n    var screenTex :RenderTexture = null;\r\n    var screenSprite :Sprite = new Sprite();\r\n\r\n    try {\r\n        screenTex = new RenderTexture(Flashbang.stageWidth, Flashbang.stageHeight, false);\r\n        screenTex.draw(this.mode.modeSprite);\r\n        screenSprite.addChild(new Image(screenTex));\r\n        this.mode.modeSprite.addChild(screenSprite);\r\n\r\n    } catch (e :Error) {\r\n        log.error(\"Failed to create screen texture\", e);\r\n\r\n        screenSprite.removeFromParent(true);\r\n        screenSprite.dispose();\r\n        screenTex.dispose();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in practice, hitting this limit and immediately disposing the offending texture results in further error 3691s in the next `Starling.render()` pass, which then crashes my game.\r\n\r\nTHE ACTUAL REQUEST:\r\n\r\nA much simpler solution is to simply tell Starling to stop rendering for the few frames that I need to pause screen updates: i.e., I set `Starling._rendering` to false and add an additional check in `Starling.nextFrame()` for the _rendering flag.\r\n\r\nIn its current incarnation, Starling doesn't support this - with `Starling.stop()`, you can stop Starling updates and continue rendering, or stop updates AND rendering, but you can't stop rendering and _continue_ updating, which is what I need.\r\n\r\nSo: I'm curious if you'd consider adding the ability to suspend rendering only.
