Feathers gets hover events and sets the hover skin and when the target changes on the hover event Feathers turns off the hovering skin on the button.\n\nHowever, there is one minor case where the hovering doesn't turn off as soon as it can, leading to a slightly annoying visual effect.\n\nIf you have a Feathers button on the very edge or slightly clipped from the desktop window, then hover over the button to trigger the hover skin, _but_ move the mouse and exit the desktop Stage3D window from the button _directly_ off the edge of the window, the hover skin stays active on the button.\n\nStarling will then not send any new 'changed target' for the hover event until the user moves the mouse back over the desktop window of the stage.\nSo eventually the hovered button skin fixes itself but only after the user moves the mouse back over the window.\n\nI notice that Starling doesn't listen at all for flash.events.Event.MOUSE_LEAVE on the native stage.\nhttp://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/display/Stage.html#event:mouseLeave\n\nWhile it might be possible for app code or even Feathers to listen for MOUSE_LEAVE on desktop and possibly try to clean up this stale hover state, I am thinking it might only be clean if Starling's touch processing system did something on desktop with MOUSE_LEAVE to somehow send an updated hover event (with either a changed target or null target or something) that could allow listeners of hover events to recognize what should be an immediate change in the current hover state?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/249/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/248","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/248/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/248/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/248/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/248","id":9810787,"number":248,"title":"Juggler

You might change it in the original code so nobody else will experience it. \n\nThanks again for all the good work!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/243","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/243/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/243/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/243/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/243","id":9629712,"number":243,"title":"Movieclip.fps setting performance issue","user":{"login":"radamchin","id":327007,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/327007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/radamchin","html_url":"https://github.com/radamchin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radamchin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radamchin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radamchin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radamchin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radamchin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radamchin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radamchin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radamchin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radamchin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2013-01-02T22:26:50Z","updated_at":"2013-01-10T04:17:51Z","closed_at":"2013-01-08T12:34:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm dynamically changing the fps of many MovieClips and it proving to be quite a bottle neck\n\n_(Project is a nature / tree simulation, eg. each leaf is a MovieClip slightly flapping in the wind, with more life like movement being achieved by altering the fps of each leaf periodically)_\n\nIt appears that the looped setFrameDuration calls and its subsequent calls to updateStartTimes are doing too many loops that they don't need to be.\n\nBelow is optimised version i'm using that solves the problem. \n\nI have inlined the setFrameDuration call and call updateStartTimes only once.  \n\nDoing so dropped the expense of the fps calls from 54% of frame time to 4% (in Adobe Scout)\n\n```\npublic function set fps(value:Number):void\n        {\n            if (value <= 0) throw new ArgumentError(\"Invalid fps: \" + value);\n\n          var newFrameDuration:Number = 1.0 / value;\n            var acceleration:Number = newFrameDuration / mDefaultFrameDuration;\n            mCurrentTime *= acceleration;\n            mDefaultFrameDuration = newFrameDuration;\n\n            var duration:Number = mDurations[i] * acceleration;\n\n            for (var i:int=0;

If I remember correctly, are not allowed on iOS.\n\nNot allowed external load in iOS app.\n\nUp to Air version 3.5.\n\nIn the new version, Air 3.6 beta, it has incorporated a new feature,\n\n\"Multiple SWF support\"\n\nhttp://labsdownload.adobe.com/pub/labs/flashruntimes/shared/air3-6_flashplayer11-6_releasenotes.pdf\n\nbut even so, still not permitted methods, Methods unload () and loadBytes ().\n\nYou use the \"Loader.loadBytes\" in AssetManager in line 478.\n\nWhen launch on device, in Fast mode, works well, (I guess that is a virtual air).\n\nBut when launch on device, in Standard mode, this hour in 57% progress, and never ends. It does not show error, but I guess it is because they are not allowed to use these methods?\n\nSomething similar here (reply 18):\nhttp://forums.adobe.com/message/4925884\n\nI use the FB 4.7 and Air 3.5 and sample mobile:\n\nhttps://github.com/PrimaryFeather/Starling-Framework/tree/master/samples/demo\n\nThe other demos I have in FB 4.7, work well.\n\nThanks for listening.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/235/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/234","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/234/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/234/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/234/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/234","id":9479268,"number":234,"title":"Scissor rectangles have a width/height of zero when using a shared context3D","user":{"login":"mikedotalmond","id":282299,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/282299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikedotalmond","html_url":"https://github.com/mikedotalmond","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikedotalmond/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikedotalmond/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikedotalmond/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikedotalmond/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikedotalmond/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikedotalmond/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikedotalmond/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikedotalmond/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikedotalmond/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2012-12-22T00:26:27Z","updated_at":"2013-01-09T02:00:02Z","closed_at":"2013-01-05T17:31:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, I had this issue using a shared context3D with Starling and some Feathers components that use masks to clip the content, like the PickerList and Toggle button.\n\nStarling doesn't call mSupport.configureBackBuffer from updateViewPort when using a shared context. That means mRenderTargetWidth and mRenderTargetHeight don't get set in the RenderSupport, and any rectangle passed to set scissorRectangle has it's width and height multiplied by zero...\n\nI tested commenting out the shared context check in Starling.updateViewPort, so configureBackBuffer is always called, and that solved the problem. It might be better if it were configurable though.\n\nHere's the test project/commit: https://github.com/mikedotalmond/feathers-shared-context3D/commit/6ae7edad84996d3fbea35167ddcc4225b742e028\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/233","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/233/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/233/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/233/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/233","id":9453294,"number":233,"title":"Text field auto size","user":{"login":"tconkling","id":709022,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/709022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling","html_url":"https://github.com/tconkling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2012-12-21T01:06:17Z","updated_at":"2014-06-15T08:09:26Z","closed_at":"2013-01-22T19:36:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pulls/233","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/233","diff_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/233.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/233.patch"},"body":"Hi Daniel,\n\nThis adds auto-sizing capabilities to TextField.

Making TouchProcessor more easily subclassable would be a big step towards easier extensibility. A more ambitious design might involve a touch processing interface that TouchProcessor implements but that other external classes could implement as well in order to have a first chance at processing touch events.\n\n(I've found that, for games that reach a certain complexity, having fine-grained control over input processing is the best way to contain what can otherwise become brittle, chaotic code.)\n\nIf you have any interest, I'd be happy to submit a pull request that implements either of these approaches. It'd almost certainly involve making some of the starling_internal components of the touch architecture public (like the ability to dispatch a TouchEvent on a bubble chain).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/230","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/230/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/230/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/230/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/230","id":9329754,"number":230,"title":"Error #2044: Unhandled IOErrorEvent -
