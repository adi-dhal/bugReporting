Creates a Image using a texture from Starling's asset manager.\n2. Applies a BlurFilter to the image.\n3. Adds the image as a child of a sprite.\n4. Flatten's the sprite and it's child.\n5. On a timer it removes the sprite, disposes it, and recreates it along with the child.  If a filter is used, the app leaks GPU memory.  No filter, no leak.\n\nAfter a few hundred iterations of the above, Scout reports GPU memory in the mid 500MB range and the app crashes.  No crash (or memory leak) occurs if I comment out the line where I apply the filter (image.filter = new BlueFilter...).\n\nThe below code demonstrates the leak.\n\n``` as3\n  private var _count:int = 0;\n  private var _image:Image;\n  private var _container:Sprite;\n\n  // Call the 'run' method to demonstrate the leak.\n  // Comment out the below filter line to make the leak go away.\n  public function run():void {\n    var timer:Timer = new Timer(500, int.MAX_VALUE);\n    timer.addEventListener(TimerEvent.TIMER, execute);\n    timer.start();\n  }\n\n  private function execute(event:TimerEvent):void {\n    // Remove and dispose container if it exists.\n    if (_container)\n      removeChild(_container, true);\n\n    // Create new container.\n    _container = new Sprite();\n    addChild(_container);\n\n    // Create new image.\n    var texture:Texture = AssetManager.instance.getTexture('main_menu_scene/border');\n    _image = new Image(texture);\n\n    // Filter for the image.\n    var filter:BlurFilter = new BlurFilter(1.5, 1.5, 2);\n    _image.filter = filter; // Comment out this line and the memory leak goes away.\n\n    // Attach the image to the container.\n    _container.addChild(_image);\n\n    // Flatten container and it's children.\n    _container.flatten();\n\n    // Monitor loop count.\n    trace(_count++);\n  }\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/726/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/725","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/725/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/725/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/725/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/725","id":88734529,"number":725,"title":"RangeError: Error #1125 at starling.display::DisplayObjectContainer/render()","user":{"login":"LvLynx","id":9196835,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/9196835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LvLynx","html_url":"https://github.com/LvLynx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LvLynx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LvLynx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LvLynx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LvLynx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LvLynx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LvLynx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LvLynx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LvLynx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LvLynx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48336470,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/labels/Waiting","name":"Waiting","color":"eb6420","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":13,"created_at":"2015-06-16T13:51:34Z","updated_at":"2016-04-14T10:10:30Z","closed_at":"2016-04-14T10:10:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Our users sometimes encounter a starling error, that we cant reproduce.

For example:\n\n<code>< textformat leading='10' >contents goes here< /textformat ></code>\n\nThat works fine and I get a textfield with extra space between lines.\n\nBut any subsequent starling textfields I create with also have the same leading, even if isHtmlText is to false.\n\nI think I can see what's causing it. When you create a new TextFormat object in the starling textfield renderText() method and apply it to the static flash textfield (sNativeTextField), the leading is not specified in the TextFormat constructor. According to the flash textfield documentation, null leading should default to '0', but it isn't. \n\nYou can replicate this by creating 3 starling textfields, one after the other, side by side, with the same text in each one. Add '< textformat leading='50' >' to the start of the second textfield so that extra linespacing appears between the lines. You should now see that the 3rd textfield has this extra spacing too.\n\nI think this could be a flash textfield bug, but can I suggest changing your TextFormat object as a workaround, and explicity setting the leading to '0'?\n\nFrom:\n\nvar textFormat:TextFormat = new TextFormat(mFontName, mFontSize \\* scale, mColor, mBold, mItalic, mUnderline, null, null, hAlign);\n\nTo:\n\nvar textFormat:TextFormat = new TextFormat(mFontName, mFontSize \\* scale, mColor, mBold, mItalic, mUnderline, null, null, hAlign, null, null, null, 0);\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/716/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/715","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/715/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/715/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/715/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/715","id":75911802,"number":715,"title":"[Request] Create something like TexturePool","user":{"login":"b005t3r","id":757150,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/757150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/b005t3r","html_url":"https://github.com/b005t3r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b005t3r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b005t3r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b005t3r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b005t3r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b005t3r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b005t3r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b005t3r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b005t3r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b005t3r/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":130317,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-05-13T09:15:18Z","updated_at":"2015-05-13T13:13:51Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"When doing custom rendering I often allocate temporary textures just to do some off-screen rendering and dispose them once they are rendered on screen - not the best approach, performance wise. I think Starling could provide something like a TexturePool class (something similar to AssetManager) for allocating temporary textures and returning them back to the pool when they are no longer needed.\n\nI know this sounds like something that an extension could do, but Starling's performance could benefit on this as well. Filters could use this class internally, so many filters which use textures of similar size could use a single Texture instance instead of allocating a new one each. Also RenderTextures which use a second texture internally could all use the same instance when preserving previously rendered contents.\n\nJust an idea, maybe not for the current version, but something to think about for Starling 2.0
