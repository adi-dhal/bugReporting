As we cannot know the destination PMA state (it can even vary from pixel to pixel), we came up with 2 solutions that would fix the bug.\n\nThe first solution is already discussed in another issue, we could alter the quadbatch fragment shader to alter the output color when not PMA to premultiply everything or the other way around, just to make sure everything is the same. Of course this is not without a potential performance impact since we add a MUL or a DIV in the shader for every pixel drawn from certain texture.\n\nThe other solution is simply to premultiply the source image supplied to the ATF converter and allow us to say wether the ATF is PMA or not (as right now you force the PMA flag to off when uploading an ATF). That way everything would be PMA and it will works flawlessly.\n\nSo my request would be for you to add a pma flag to TextureOptions and an additional argument to fromAtfData(..) plus the additional plumbing between AssetManager and Texture. It is transparent for existing users and it would fix all our issues with PMA / non PMA.\n\nHere is the same example where we did just that : manually premultiplied the png before submitting to png2atf then forced the pma to true in fromAtfData().\n![atfwithpma](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/24419/9738872/c7a3c152-564d-11e5-9f9b-d05d30d0787a.png)\n\nI can do the patch myself and submit it if you want.\nWhat do you think ?\n\nSeb\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/762/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/761","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/761/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/761/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/761/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/761","id":105229217,"number":761,"title":"TextField align behavior (autoSize & hAlign)","user":{"login":"Maligan","id":1263469,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1263469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maligan","html_url":"https://github.com/Maligan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maligan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maligan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maligan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maligan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maligan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maligan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maligan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maligan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maligan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":130316,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"e10c02","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/milestones/1/labels","id":1120809,"number":1,"title":"Starling 2.0","description":"This release will come with a much more flexible rendering architecture and some other changes I've been wishing to make for a long time.

Right after this I get the error witch lead to some strange rendering.\n\n```\nArgumentError: Error #3672\n    at starling.display::QuadBatch/createBuffers()\n```\n\nNow I have added following lines right before calling starling.start() and the bug is gone!\n\n```\nStarling.current.context.clear();\nStarling.current.context.present();\n```\n\nI know my story lacks details and a good example to reproduce, but may be it will help someone (this problem seams petty popular). And probably bugtracking system in not the place for this )\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/757/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/756","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/756/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/756/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/756/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/756","id":102711713,"number":756,"title":"m","user":{"login":"samao","id":13015125,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13015125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samao","html_url":"https://github.com/samao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-08-24T05:37:47Z","updated_at":"2015-08-24T05:38:16Z","closed_at":"2015-08-24T05:38:16Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pulls/756","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/756","diff_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/756.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/756.patch"},"body":"test\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/756/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/755","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/755/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/755/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/755/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/755","id":101366482,"number":755,"title":"help！Texture

To this end, we should check if the cursor is still touching the button when TouchPhase.ENDED fires.\n\n```\n public function isStillTouching(target:DisplayObject):Boolean \n { \n    if (target.hitTest(this.getLocation(target)) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n } \n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/748/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/747","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/747/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/747/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/747/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/747","id":99146723,"number":747,"title":"Button 'onTouch' event null reference","user":{"login":"cgascons","id":2189330,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2189330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgascons","html_url":"https://github.com/cgascons","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgascons/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgascons/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgascons/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgascons/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgascons/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgascons/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgascons/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgascons/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgascons/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":130316,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"e10c02","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2015-08-05T08:03:11Z","updated_at":"2015-08-05T09:57:55Z","closed_at":"2015-08-05T09:39:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi there Daniel,\n\nI'm facing a pretty random issue regarding the touch management on the Button.as class. My app in production is logging null reference errors at the 'onTouch' class. I only managed to generate this issue once, \"spamming\" a button and moving it at the same time. It crashed me at the line 166 of this class. The mTriggerBounds variable was null, which makes me think that somehow, it \"skipped\" or didn't get into the previous BEGAN/DOWN condition where this variable gets filled. I spent quite a while yesterday trying to get a 100% repro steps, but wasn't lucky at all. I guess a security check could easily solve the issue, but to be honest I'm intrigued on what could be happening here!\n\nThanks for the
