Starling is easy to use, simple and fast framework.\nBut, unfortunately, in some games, where I need to control over 5000 objects (only Starling, no physics engine), starling becomes a bit slower. I get stable ~30fps. And I ported my game to SpriteKit. I'm currently using SpriteKit the first time. I would like to see some of advantages of it and my requests in Starling in future versions.\n1. By default, touch handler is disabled.\n2. Calling functions instead of dispatching events:\n   for example\n\n``` actionscript\nclass MySprite extends Sprite {\noverride public function touchBegan(touches:Vector.<Touch>):void {...}\noverride public function touchMoved(touches:Vector.<Touch>):void {...}\noverride public function touchEnded(touches:Vector.<Touch>):void {...}\noverride public function enterFrame(time:int):void {... }\noverride public function addedToStage(parent:DisplayObject):void {...}\n...\n```\n\nor using interfaces\n\n``` actionscript\ninterface ITouchCalls {\nfunction get touchable():Boolean;\nfunction touchBegan(touches:Vector.<Touch>):void;\nfunction touchMoved(touches:Vector.<Touch>):void;\nfunction touchEnd(touches:Vector.<Touch>):void;\n}\n\ninterface IRenderCalls {\nfunction enterFrame(time:int):void;\n}\n\ninterface IStageCalls {\nfunction addedToStage(parent:DisplayObject):void;\nfunction removedFromStage():void;\n}\n```\n\nI think using interfaces makes  objects more flexible and customizable. So I can add only functions that I use.\n\n``` actionscript\nclass PlayButton extends Image implements ITouchCalls { ... }\nclass Enemy extends Image implements IStageCalls, IRenderCalls { ... }\n```\n\n3 . `addChild()` must throw error if displayobject has a parent. For sorting the hierarchy use `zIndex`\n4 . Default settings architecture:\n\n``` actionscript\nclass TextureMipMapping {\nstatic const DEFAULT:int = -1;\nstatic const FALSE: 0;\nstatic const TRUE:int = 1;\n}\n\nclass TextureScale {\nstatic const DEFAULT:Number = Number.NaN;\n}\n```\n\n``` actionscript\n...\n//Setting default variables\nStarling.TextureMipMap = TextureMipMapping.FALSE;\nStarling.TextureScale = 3.0;\nstarling = new Starling(...);\n...\n\n//Image texture has no mip and scaled to 1/3;\nvar image = new Image(Texture.fromEmbeddedAsset(SomeClass));\n\n//image2 texture has no mip and scaled to 1/2;\nvar image2 = new Image(Texture.fromEmbeddedAsset(SomeClass, TextureMipMapping.DEFAULT, 2));\n\n//image3 texture has mip and scaled to 1/3\nvar image3 = new Image(Texture.fromEmbeddedAsset(SomeClass, TextureMipMapping.TRUE, TextureScale.DEFAULT));\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/773/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/772","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/772/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/772/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/772/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/772","id":109257129,"number":772,"title":"Starling pause","user":{"login":"Pandan","id":1301344,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1301344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pandan","html_url":"https://github.com/Pandan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pandan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pandan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pandan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pandan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pandan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pandan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pandan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pandan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pandan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":130317,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":13,"created_at":"2015-10-01T08:59:45Z","updated_at":"2015-10-07T12:21:10Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi!\n\nI am having a problem with performance in an ANE on iOS when running Starling(and Feathers).\nI partially solved it setting Starling.current.nativeStage.frameRate = 1 when the ANE is active.

problem.\nhttp://forum.starling-framework.org/topic/how-to-pause-starling\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/772/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/771","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/771/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/771/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/771/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/771","id":107926275,"number":771,"title":"travis:

However, I discovered that removeEventListener() can allocate a new Vector even when the listener hasn't been added. It checks if numListeners is > 0, but not that the listener is currently stored in the Vector.\n\nIn a Feathers List, new textures may be created frequently as the List scrolls. All of these allocations will cause garbage collection, which will affect performance negatively.\n\nA quick fix for ConcreteTexture would be to remove the event listener only when required:\n\n```\npublic function set onRestore(value:Function):void\n{\n    if (Starling.handleLostContext && value != null)\n    {\n        mOnRestore = value;\n        Starling.current.addEventListener(Event.CONTEXT3D_CREATE, onContextCreated);\n    }\n    else if (mOnRestore != null)\n    {\n        Starling.current.removeEventListener(Event.CONTEXT3D_CREATE, onContextCreated);\n        mOnRestore = null;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, I also think that this Vector.<Function> allocation in removeEventListener() should be addressed. It's likely to affect performance in other places.\n\nAdditionally, using indexOf() may allow you to skip some of the iterations in the for loop. Instead of creating a new empty Vector, you could use slice() to include all of the items before the listener in a copy. I didn't test this code, but it should give you an idea of what I have in mind:\n\n```\nif (numListeners > 0)\n{\n    // we must not modify the original vector, but work on a copy.\n    // (see comment in 'invokeEvent')\n\n    var index:int = listeners.indexOf(listener);\n    if (index != -1)\n    {\n        var restListeners:Vector.<Function> = listeners.slice(0, numListeners);\n\n        for (var i:int=index+1; i<numListeners; ++i)\n        {\n            restListeners[i-1] = listeners[i];\n        }\n\n        mEventListeners[type] = restListeners;\n    }\n}\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/767","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/767/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/767/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/767/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/767","id":107514192,"number":767,"title":"Small changes","user":{"login":"gabrielPeart","id":194588,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/194588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielPeart","html_url":"https://github.com/gabrielPeart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielPeart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielPeart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielPeart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielPeart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielPeart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielPeart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielPeart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielPeart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielPeart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-09-21T13:38:50Z","updated_at":"2015-09-23T09:08:00Z","closed_at":"2015-09-23T09:01:58Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pulls/767","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/767","diff_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/767.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/767.patch"},"body":"Hi Daniel,\n\nThanks for doing an amazing job.

Daniel,\n\nI tried to be a little invasive as possible and to follow your \"style\".\nI added a flag on starling to request the non PMA texture to be converted to PMA, false by default so it should keep the old code exactly as fast as before.\nIf the flag is set to true, then It'll convert the non PMA texture to PMA in the shader and force blending to consider everything as PMA (regardless of the original texture format).\n\nIt fix all our blending issues.\n\nThanks for your time (Simas told me that v2-beta is across the corner, can't wait!)\n\nSeb\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/764/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/763","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/763/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/763/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/763/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/763","id":105973163,"number":763,"title":"Allow
