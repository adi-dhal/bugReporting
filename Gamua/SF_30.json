Normally the suggestion is to store and keep a reference to the original bitmapData.  That is reasonable, but on many platforms we also might have to turn on handleLostContext which means Starling concrete textures will also end up keeping around a reference to the source bitmap data.\n\nIt would be great if we know we are using handleLostContext = true to just rely and use Starling's existing reference of the bitmapData in ConcreteTexture if we could get at it with a getter.\n\nHowever, you might initially think that there is no difference to externally keeping a reference to the bitmapData since Starling is only just going to keep a reference to that same original bitmapData and so there is no memory cost savings, but in general this might not be the case.\nInside Texture, if the incoming bitmapData is not a POT texture, Starling internally creates a new BitmapData instance and will use this new POT sized bitmapData as its reference.\nWe would then be keeping around two copies of bitmapData instances for any nonPOT data with handleLostContext = true.\n\nIf we could just always ask for the stored mData from Starling's ConcreteTexture we would only ever have one bitmapData instance per ConcreteTexture.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/125","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/125/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/125/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/125/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/125","id":5016980,"number":125,"title":"use more then one of Starling instance.","user":{"login":"Lepozuk","id":1825851,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1825851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lepozuk","html_url":"https://github.com/Lepozuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lepozuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lepozuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lepozuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lepozuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lepozuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lepozuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lepozuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lepozuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lepozuk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2012-06-12T03:20:05Z","updated_at":"2012-07-29T03:41:52Z","closed_at":"2012-07-19T10:38:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"If I want use more then one of Starling instance.

My understanding is that Starling will probably implement a filters system similar to native at some point anyway - but that will be applicable to all DOs. I think TF's can be an exception as they are already being rendered using native anyway (bitmap excluded), so I have added a 'nativeFilters' property accordingly.\n\nThis gives a nice way to quickly get the same effects we had during design time in the IDE - something that's often critical on mobile devices for readability anyway. Glow Filters and Drop Shadows in particular are great for readability.\n\nAny applied filters that increase the size (i.e. Glow Filters) would still need room inside the TF to render - but as this also applies to specifying the text size anyway (autoScale aside) I don't think this is an issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/124/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/123","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/123/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/123/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/123/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/123","id":4963782,"number":123,"title":"Set

using the sample mobile project to develop in a coordinate space of 480x320 and let Starling handle the scaling to 960x640 (iOS retina display).\n\nTake the following code:\n\n``` actionscript3\nprivate function _initGraphics():void\n{\n    _body = new Image(Assets.getTexture('myTexture'));\n    _body.width = 100; // Dimensions relative to 480x320 coordinate space\n    _body.height = 100;\n    addChild(_body);\n\n    _body.pivotX = 50;\n    _body.pivotY = 50;\n    addEventListener(EnterFrameEvent.ENTER_FRAME, onFrame);\n}\n\nprivate function onFrame(e : EnterFrameEvent):void\n{\n    _body.rotation += 0.1;\n}\n```\n\nClearly this should rotate about the centre of the image and it works fine when run at 480x360. However, when I run it at 960x640 or on my iPhone 4 it clearly pivots around another point entirely, closer to the bottom right of the Image. I tried changing pivotX/pivotY to 100 each and it displays correctly at the high resolution but incorrectly at the low resolution. This leads me to believe that perhaps Image wasn't updated properly when contentScaleFactor came out.\n\nI should note that if I wrap the Image in a Sprite and set pivotX/pivotY on the Sprite instead, it works fine it both resolutions.\n\nI'd just like to say that apart from this, the framework is absolutely amazing. Thanks so much for everyone's hard work!\n\nEdit: I'm using the SWC from May 07, 2012 by the way.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/114/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/113","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/113/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/113/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/113/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/113","id":4584436,"number":113,"title":"MovieClip
