feature request, but related to discovering that with the latest 3.8 SDK beta one can only use RectangleTexture with Context3DProfile.BASELINE and Context3DProfile.BASELINE_EXTENDED, and as another example, 4096 textures are only available with Context3DProfile.BASELINE_EXTENDED.\n\nOne might want to design a cross-platform app (desktop + iOS + Android) and might want to both conditionally support 4096 textures (if the device supports it), or separately also use RectangleTexture (if the device supports it).\n\nSo instead of designing my Starling app to pick one universal profile choice, I'd like to be able to tell Starling, try using Context3DProfile.BASELINE_EXTENDED, if it fails to create a Context3D, fallback to Context3DProfile.BASELINE, and finally if it doesn't support either of those fallback to Context3DProfile.BASELINE_CONSTRAINED.\n\nThen knowing which profile at runtime was used I can easily deal with conditionally creating RectangleTextures or 4096 textures because I now know the active profile at runtime.\n\nIf you aren't keen at allowing an ordered array of optional profile choices for the Starling constructor, maybe you could at least show or provide a minimal implementation of a profile supported util function like:\n\npublic function supportsProfile(profile:String):Boolean that at least developers could optionally call at startup to externally run fallback code if their app desired it and then pass a pofile to the Starling constructor in the existing way.\n\nThanks\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/337/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/336","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/336/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/336/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/336/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/336","id":14631401,"number":336,"title":"New

I've just added below code above the mRawAssets.pop() as a quick fix:\n\n``` as3\nif(mRawAssets.length == 0)\nreturn;\n```\n\nIs this a valid issue or am I doning something wrong with the AssetManager?\n\nRegards!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/335/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/334","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/334/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/334/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/334/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/334","id":14416097,"number":334,"title":"EventDispatcher: optimized access of listener[i] in removeEventListener()","user":{"login":"joshtynjala","id":141885,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/141885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala","html_url":"https://github.com/joshtynjala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtynjala/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-05-16T17:03:16Z","updated_at":"2013-05-17T16:24:02Z","closed_at":"2013-05-17T16:23:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pulls/334","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/334","diff_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/334.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/334.patch"},"body":"Saved listener[i] into a variable so that you don't need to access it twice while looping.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/334/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/333","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/333/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/333/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/333/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/333","id":14318627,"number":333,"title":"DisplayObjectContainer dispose does dispose children but do not wipe the mChildren","user":{"login":"Fraggle","id":24419,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/24419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fraggle","html_url":"https://github.com/Fraggle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fraggle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fraggle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fraggle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fraggle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fraggle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fraggle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fraggle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fraggle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fraggle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2013-05-14T16:29:29Z","updated_at":"2013-05-17T16:26:24Z","closed_at":"2013-05-17T16:26:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\n\nIn the dispose method of DisplayObjectContainer, dont you think you should nullify the mChildren array (or at least empty it) to avoid potential circular reference issue (displayObjectContainer is the mParent of it's children) ?\n\nBecause at the moment we do removeChildren(0, -1, true); then dispose.

may be a minor issue/feature request for most apps, but I wanted to at least mention it in case it could/would be part of any more significant refactoring for Starling 1.4+ changes.\n\nWhat I notice in my app, where I sometimes have to load a lot of active simultaneous content, or sometimes switch to not very much active content, (especially with using Feathers controls where clipping rects and lists are active, and then not shown) is that my active draw counts (== use of active mQuadBatches length in RenderSupport) can jump around from 1-3 and then sometimes temporarily up to around 50-60 active mQuadBatches in RenderSupport, but then fall back down to a steady use of 1-5 draw counts.\n\nI notice internally in RenderSupport it uses an mQuadBatches vector and pushes as needed, new QuadBatch instances as more are needed.\n\nNow I understand the need to not reset the length of mQuadBatches.length = 1 inside nextFrame() as this would cause a crazy new amount of QuadBatch instances to be made and slow things down greatly, but then my understanding is that the length of mQuadBatches will always stay as large as the most active draw count an app will ever get to, and then never dispose of any of the QuadBatch instances in this vector (even if the app rarely, or never, returns to that active peak draw count).\n\nProfiling the app seems to show these extra QuadBatches (and corresponding vertex and index buffers) taking up memory.\n\nWould it be possible to offer some sort of trim() on Starling (and thus RenderSupport) that could do a trimming of the current mQuadBatches length (as well as calling dispose() on the extra QuadBatches removed)?\n\nOf course a developer wouldn't want to call this trim() very often, but if we knew we just closed a very active screen that was an abnormal amount of draw counts, could we not then clean up/release extra QuadBatch memory use?\n\nThanks\nJeff\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/329/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/328","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/328/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/328/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/328/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/328","id":13761918,"number":328,"title":"render

`bounceLoop = true` will set `loop = false` and setting `loop = true` will set `bounceLoop = false`, since the two cannot both be true at once.  `reverse` works whether or not `loop` or `bounceLoop` are set.\n\nthere are two commits in this pull request because i implemented these changes against an out-of-date version of `MovieClip` and had to go back and reimplement them against the latest version.  better to look at the MovieClip.as diff than to look through the individual commits.\n\ni haven't tested with your unit tests as i don't have that test suite set up, but i manually tested all the permutations of `loop`, `bounceLoop`, `reverse`, and an `Event.COMPLETE` handler that i could come up with.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/323/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/322","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/322/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/322/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/322/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/322","id":13175749,"number":322,"title":"added

With the fix, it behaves perfectly.\n\nThe alternative (which I suspect many people have implemented) is to detect this flip condition after setting the transformation matrix, but that's cumbersome at every assignment.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/317","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/317/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/317/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/317/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/317","id":12873455,"number":317,"title":"hitarea will misplace when set pivortX/Y","user":{"login":"HiWill","id":1683805,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1683805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiWill","html_url":"https://github.com/HiWill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiWill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiWill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiWill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiWill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiWill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiWill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiWill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiWill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiWill/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2013-04-06T07:46:56Z","updated_at":"2013-06-04T10:55:59Z","closed_at":"2013-06-04T10:55:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"hitarea will misplace when set pivortX/Y\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/317/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/316","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/316/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/316/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/316/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/316","id":12873447,"number":316,"title":"Filter will cause render issue","user":{"login":"HiWill","id":1683805,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1683805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiWill","html_url":"https://github.com/HiWill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiWill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiWill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiWill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiWill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiWill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiWill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiWill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiWill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiWill/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":130316,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"e10c02","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2013-04-06T07:45:15Z","updated_at":"2013-06-27T07:56:59Z","closed_at":"2013-06-27T07:56:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Filter will cause render issue , when use filter with flatten\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/315","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/315/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/315/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Gamua/Starling-Framework/issues/315/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Gamua/Starling-Framework/pull/315","id":12791865,"number":315,"title":"bug Fix.
