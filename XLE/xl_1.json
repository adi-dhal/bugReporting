There are a few issues, mostly related to the following points:\n- VS2015 is more compliant to the standard for generating implicit copy constructors/operators (where VS2013 was more lenient).\n  - in VS2015, if any of the copy/move operators are explicitly defined, then the implicitly generated operators will be marked \"= delete\". This is the correct standard behaviour. But in these cases, VS2013 will generate them (possibly because the \"= default\" mark wasn't implemented).\n  - we predicted this problem, and tried to explicitly mark operators as \"= delete\" to prevent VS2013 from generating them\n  - but some cases slipped through... \n  - Unfortunately the compiler errors related to these problems are difficult to read\n- VS2015 adds extra warnings\n  - the new warnings will have to be disabled for now (because we compile with warnings as errors)\n- VS2015 deprecates some functions/headers (like hash_map), some of which are used by foreign libraries\n- some changes to managed compiler behaviour \n- some foreign libraries are compiled for VS2013\n- there are some other cases were code at the very edge of the standard needs to be adjusted\n\nHowever, working with VS2015 would be useful, because the VS2013 community edition is no longer available (!!). Plus, in some cases fixing these problems could improve overall performance or robustness.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xlgames-inc/XLE/issues/5/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xlgames-inc/XLE/issues/4","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xlgames-inc/XLE","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xlgames-inc/XLE/issues/4/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xlgames-inc/XLE/issues/4/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xlgames-inc/XLE/issues/4/events","html_url":"https://github.com/xlgames-inc/XLE/pull/4","id":124759697,"number":4,"title":"Merge

is currently used for compiling shaders in the background.\n\nThis is complicating the build process, because it requires the correct version of the DXSDK included (as D3DX isn't included in the Windows SDK).\nIt would be better to not use D3DX. This will avoid the dependency on the DXSDK, and only the Windows SDK would be required.\nHowever, this requires a new \"thread pump\" type solution for compiling shaders in the background.\n\nRecently textures were moved to the \"BufferUploads\" thread pump, and use the DirectXTex library -- so only shaders are now using D3DX. The D3DX implementation was useful, but it had some problems... It was just a \"stepping stone\" solution to more complete implementation.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xlgames-inc/XLE/issues/1/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4990","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507320744","x-github-request-id":"D7D2:2B9B:10BC75:236605:59D7D5AD","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","etag":"\"cef13a02f6e3fef7a13583f2c742e9ce\"","status":"200 OK"}}
