It would help for incorporating into my own project build system, so I can just take the parts I want. It is also cool because it keeps the whole codebase in a single language, so it's easier to switch between tasks, for me. Another strength of this approach is that you could keep all dependencies outside of version-control (using npm package.json.) Is there interest in converting python tool stack to node/grunt things?  If so, is there a succinct list of all tools that people use?\n\nI notice these, that may be candidates for js/grunt equivs:\n\n`Makefile` - this could be handled by grunt\n\n`manage.py` - this could be handled by grunt, with similar targets to flag.  I might recommend grouping targets, because that is really easy in grunt:\n\ngrunt dev (clean, typescript-compile, lint, test)\ngrunt dev-nolint (clean, typescript-compile, test)\n\ngrunt lib (clean, typescript-compile, lint, uglify, test)\ngrunt nolint (clean, typescript-compile, uglify, test)\n\nWith some sub-targets for doc, samples, & tools\n\nIt might be nice to also do live-reloading with watch, and incorporate a dev server for file:// URL issues.\n\ntools/cgfx2json - not sure, but this might be accomplished with [node-cuda](https://github.com/kashif/node-cuda), and integrated as a grunt task, if needed\n\nI have experience with all but the last, and would need to do a bit of research to see if [node-cuda](https://github.com/kashif/node-cuda) would do what is needed.
