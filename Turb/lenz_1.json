It, and all of it's children should become transparent, multiplying opacities down the scene graph.\n2. It's content should become transparent but not that of its descendants.\n3. Same as (1), but the whole object should be flattened into a plane.\n\nThe reason I want your opinion is because the new specs for CSS 3D (css-transforms) [state here](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transforms/#grouping-property-values) that the answer is (3).\n\nTo see what I mean, view these two examples in Chrome 53 or higher:\n- https://jsfiddle.net/trusktr/ymonmo70/16\n- https://jsfiddle.net/trusktr/ymonmo70/17\n\nThe second example has opacity applied to the node that contains all the sub-nodes which compose the car. The opacity, according to spec, flattens the car into a plane (turns it into paper!).\n\nI'm asking various 3D engine authors for opinions of what the correct or most expected behavior should be.\n\nAll the best,\n~ Joe\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/turbulenz/turbulenz_engine/issues/55/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/turbulenz/turbulenz_engine/issues/54","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/turbulenz/turbulenz_engine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/turbulenz/turbulenz_engine/issues/54/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/turbulenz/turbulenz_engine/issues/54/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/turbulenz/turbulenz_engine/issues/54/events","html_url":"https://github.com/turbulenz/turbulenz_engine/issues/54","id":162954447,"number":54,"title":"May

This causes problems with [this line](https://github.com/turbulenz/turbulenz_engine/blob/master/tslib/webgl/graphicsdevice.ts#L4916) because `Float32Array.prototype.map` won't be undefined and the custom methods map, unmap, and setData won't be defined. \n\nThere are two possible fixes I can see: rename your custom map method to something that doesn't conflict, or a more local fix is that you can override the built-in map by checking `Float32Array.hasOwnProperty('map')` instead of `Float32Array.prototype.map === undefined` (the built-in map is defined on `Float32Array.prototype.__proto__`, the shared prototype of all the typed arrays, so you'd be overriding the built-in map only for Float32Array instances).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/turbulenz/turbulenz_engine/issues/43/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/turbulenz/turbulenz_engine/issues/42","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/turbulenz/turbulenz_engine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/turbulenz/turbulenz_engine/issues/42/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/turbulenz/turbulenz_engine/issues/42/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/turbulenz/turbulenz_engine/issues/42/events","html_url":"https://github.com/turbulenz/turbulenz_engine/pull/42","id":55681019,"number":42,"title":"Update

Upon running the file, I get the error message listed below.\n\nWhen I use sudo (even though there was no permission denied) everything is installed. I run source start_env. In the virtual environment, I try to run ./start_local.sh and get the following error:\n\n``` bash\n(env)jelle@ubuntu:~/Turbulenz/SDK/0.27.0$ Error running local server\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/jelle/Turbulenz/SDK/0.27.0/env/bin/local_server\", line 4, in <module>\n    import pkg_resources\nImportError: No module named pkg_resources\n```\n\nWith sudo it works and I can access localhost:8070, but then finally when I try to run dae2json from within the virtual environment, it gives the error:\n\n``` bash\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/jelle/Turbulenz/SDK/0.27.0/env/bin/dae2json\", line 4, in <module>\n    import pkg_resources\nImportError: No module named pkg_resources\n```\n\nThis time sudo dae2json doesn't save me:\n\n``` bash\nsudo: dae2json: command not found\n```\n\nAll of this leads me to suspect that using sudo all this time was a mistake that bypassed the virtual environment, and even though the paths are set up correctly inside the environment, it doesn't have the pkg_resources module.\n\nHelp!\n\n``` bash\n// FIRST ERROR MESSAGE\nUnzipping the Turbulenz SDK ...\nCreating a virtualenv in /home/jelle/Turbulenz/SDK/0.27.0 (this isolates the Turbulenz\ntools from your system Python installation) ...\nRunning virtualenv with interpreter /usr/bin/python2.7\nCreating env/lib/python2.7\nSymlinking Python bootstrap modules\n  Symlinking env/lib/python2.7/config\n  Symlinking env/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload\n  Symlinking env/lib/python2.7/os.py\n  Ignoring built-in bootstrap module: posix\n  Symlinking env/lib/python2.7/posixpath.py\n  Cannot import bootstrap module: nt\n  Symlinking env/lib/python2.7/ntpath.py\n  Symlinking env/lib/python2.7/genericpath.py\n  Symlinking env/lib/python2.7/fnmatch.py\n  Symlinking env/lib/python2.7/locale.py\n  Symlinking env/lib/python2.7/encodings\n  Symlinking env/lib/python2.7/codecs.py\n  Symlinking env/lib/python2.7/stat.py\n  Symlinking env/lib/python2.7/UserDict.py\n  Symlinking env/lib/python2.7/copy_reg.py\n  Symlinking env/lib/python2.7/types.py\n  Symlinking env/lib/python2.7/re.py\n  Symlinking env/lib/python2.7/sre.py\n  Symlinking env/lib/python2.7/sre_parse.py\n  Symlinking env/lib/python2.7/sre_constants.py\n  Symlinking env/lib/python2.7/sre_compile.py\n  Ignoring built-in bootstrap module: zlib\n  Symlinking env/lib/python2.7/warnings.py\n  Symlinking env/lib/python2.7/linecache.py\n  Symlinking env/lib/python2.7/_abcoll.py\n  Symlinking env/lib/python2.7/abc.py\n  Symlinking env/lib/python2.7/_weakrefset.py\nCreating env/lib/python2.7/site-packages\nWriting env/lib/python2.7/site.py\nWriting env/lib/python2.7/orig-prefix.txt\nWriting env/lib/python2.7/no-global-site-packages.txt\nCreating parent directories for env/include\nSymlinking env/include/python2.7\nCreating env/bin\nNew python executable in env/bin/python2.7\nChanged mode of env/bin/python2.7 to 0775\nAlso creating executable in env/bin/python\nChanged mode of env/bin/python to 0775\nTesting executable with env/bin/python2.7 -c \"import sys;out=sys.stdout;getattr(out, \"buffer\", out).write(sys.prefix.encode(\"utf-8\"))\"\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site.py\", line 562, in <module>\n    main()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site.py\", line 544, in main\n    known_paths = addusersitepackages(known_paths)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site.py\", line 271, in addusersitepackages\n    user_site = getusersitepackages()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site.py\", line 246, in getusersitepackages\n    user_base = getuserbase() #
