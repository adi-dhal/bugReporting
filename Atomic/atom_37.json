Regenerating the cache generates errors in the log about the missing resources, but wading through the logs to pick these up is inefficient.\n\nWhat would be really useful is a window that pops up when such missing dependencies are detected, with a tree view showing the dependency route. So for example, if a model is loaded and one of the textures are missing:\n\nPath\\To\\Model.fbx\n|-Path\\To\\Material.material\n  |-Path\\To\\Texture.png (Highlighted/red)\n\nHaving a menu option

made a bare Ubuntu VM to see if I could compile Atomic, and I ran into quite a few pitfalls. The first few of those are documented in AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine#555 . The last few were related to node and libcurl not being present on my bare Ubuntu machine, although they are (or should be) available in the Atomic repo itself. I added node, and linked the correct libcurl. There were also some linker errors due to NETCore and NETScript not being linked in Linux. We could (probably should) automatically set the CMAKE variable LINUX to TRUE in cache if the CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME is \"Linux\" instead of requiring it to be set on the cmake command line.\n\nAll of that is fixed with this PR, so hopefully this will help the Linux build along.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/555","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/555/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/555/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/555/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/555","id":124605532,"number":555,"title":"Linux

WebRequest class uses libcurl to make http/https requests.\n\nIt has planned support for Emscripten, which is not included, but it's partially done (I needed to make some of it to make sure that the

Assimp and libcurl now use a common zlib static library.\n\nAlso, some of libcurl's CMake build system was added. I plan to make iOS, OSX, and Windows use their own TLS implementations eventually _(Update: This is now done, see commits and comments below.)_, but for now, they all use OpenSSL, which would be needed for new platforms, and is useful to have around for hashs and signatures.\n\nThere is an AtomicExamples pull request for example
