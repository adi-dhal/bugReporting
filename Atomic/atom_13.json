There is a check added to the play event handler, which looks to see if the current project is c#, then does a check for out of date sources. If the sources are ok, then no further action is needed, it simply plays the project. If the sources are out of date, then the BuildAndPlay processing starts and it returns out of the play event handler.  The BuildAndPlay function then compiles the project, and in the compile completed event handler, if successful, issues a Play event and the project is played after a short pause. If the compilation fails, only an error is put in the console, and the project is not played. Because of the fine work someone did when c# is compiling, the play button greys out while this compile happens also, giving the user an indication something is happening.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1280","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1280/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1280/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1280/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/1280","id":195659195,"number":1280,"title":"Updates","user":{"login":"JoshEngebretson","id":376203,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/376203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshEngebretson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/milestones/1/labels","id":2135079,"number":1,"title":"Atomic

has the ability to have enums and with a compiler flag, the generated ```js``` will automatically be replaced with the constant ```int``` value when transpiled.  \r\n\r\nso in ```Atomic.d.ts``` you would have\r\n```\r\n  export const enum CurveType {\r\n      INSTANT = 0,\r\n      LINEAR = 1,\r\n      QUADRATIC = 2,\r\n      CUBIC = 3\r\n  }\r\n```\r\ninstead of\r\n```\r\n   export type

up when migrating to this:\r\n* The generated ```js``` code would have these variables replaced with ```ints``` so the js will be slightly less readable, however a comment will be added that indicates the name of the enum.\r\n* development in vanilla js would not be able to use the enums.  The internal enum name would need to be used so instead of using ```CurveType.INSTANT```, you would need to use ```Atomic.INSTANT```\r\n\r\nThe pro side to this though is that intellisense and readability in TypeScript scripts/components will be improved.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1267","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1267/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1267/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1267/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1267","id":194430590,"number":1267,"title":"[Editor]
