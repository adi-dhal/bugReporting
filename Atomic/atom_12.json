would be good to be able to extend the core engine API with JavaScript (in addition to the native API exposed by duktape).  This will allow us more flexibility and extend classes/marshalling like we currently can do in C#.  Core engine extensions should (at least initially) be in pure JS with TypeScript ambient declarations.\r\n\r\nJS class prototypes are challenging to layout using custom duktape stack manipulation, though hotspot methods can still be dropped native code with this strategy. \r\n\r\nThe source for the core engine extensions in JS will reside in a subfolder in CoreData and be available to all applications.  The core engine JS extension import mechanism should initialize with the rest of the JS system and be fault tolerant if the source files are missing.\r\n\r\nA motivation on this feature is to have math classes like Vector2/Vector3/Quat that are consistent with the C++ and C# API's instead of adding modules like gl-matrix to projects. (Math classes in JS are represented as number arrays and this remains an important performance/marshalling consideration when considering how to factor in more common X/Y/Z/W properties)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1317/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1316","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1316/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1316/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1316/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/1316","id":198621705,"number":1316,"title":"Fixed all occurrences of `typscript` typo, and reverted #1309.","user":{"login":"rosshadden","id":669012,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/669012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosshadden","html_url":"https://github.com/rosshadden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosshadden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosshadden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosshadden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosshadden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosshadden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosshadden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosshadden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosshadden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosshadden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/milestones/3","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/milestone/3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/milestones/3/labels","id":2177423,"number":3,"title":"Atomic Build 3","description":"","creator":{"login":"JoshEngebretson","id":376203,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/376203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshEngebretson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":42,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-12-05T22:09:39Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T14:36:53Z","due_on":"2017-01-20T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2017-01-23T14:36:53Z"},"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-01-04T03:14:42Z","updated_at":"2017-01-20T19:33:13Z","closed_at":"2017-01-04T03:54:27Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pulls/1316","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/1316","diff_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/1316.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/1316.patch"},"body":"Reverted #1309 for the reasons explained [here](https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/1309#issuecomment-270283241).

physics scripting API is missing various casting methods due to PhysicsRaycastResult not being available to scripting.  PhysicsRaycastResult needs to inherit from RefCounted and be added to the physics package.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Ray class needs to be added.  This should not extend RefCounted and instead use a blittable struct C# side (which we already have in the AtomicNET math module). It should use a custom JS type (defined in duktape API) for JS/TS side.  *This could be an opportunity to add \"raw\" classes to JSBind*, which would be used in bindings though with no (or little) generated implementation details.

Having Pro Builder/CSG-style level building would certainly make it even more attractive for me, since in many cases when you can create and manipulate geometry directly in the editor, 3D modeling software would only needed to be used to do either entities or more detailed versions of parts of the environment such as houses if needed. For indie projects, CSG is often what you only need since art budgets in indie teams are so low that we could as well build maps with CSG - would be easier and result would be about the same.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1310/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1309","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1309/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1309/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1309/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/1309","id":198295029,"number":1309,"title":"Added `include` block to tsconfig.","user":{"login":"rosshadden","id":669012,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/669012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosshadden","html_url":"https://github.com/rosshadden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosshadden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosshadden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosshadden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosshadden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosshadden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosshadden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosshadden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosshadden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rosshadden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/milestones/3","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/milestone/3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/milestones/3/labels","id":2177423,"number":3,"title":"Atomic Build 3","description":"","creator":{"login":"JoshEngebretson","id":376203,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/376203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshEngebretson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":42,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-12-05T22:09:39Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T14:36:53Z","due_on":"2017-01-20T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2017-01-23T14:36:53Z"},"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-01-02T04:26:27Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T02:49:16Z","closed_at":"2017-01-02T19:48:12Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pulls/1309","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/1309","diff_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/1309.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/1309.patch"},"body":"This makes typescript only scan the relevant directories, which should make it faster to build.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1309/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1308","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1308/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1308/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1308/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1308","id":198282061,"number":1308,"title":"[C#] -

looks like a new version of the TS compiler changed the way it handles internal object literals.  Previously:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nclass Foo extends Atomic.JSComponent {\r\n   inspectorFields = {\r\n      speed: 1.0\r\n  };\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwould work and would get converted in the JS to ```this.inspectorFields = ...```.\r\n\r\nNow, it gets converted to ```_this.inspectorFields = ...``` which means it's no longer seen by the inspector.\r\n\r\nThere are some options:\r\n1. Do not allow the ```inspectorFields``` to reside in the component and instead define it outside the component, but within the same module.  Need to update all the examples and project templates to handle it this way.\r\n2. Specifically look for ```_this.inspectorFields``` in addition to ```this.inspectorFields```\r\n3. Make the process that looks for the inspector fields actually instantiate the component and use normal JS methods to grab the contents of the inspector fields -- new issue #1332\r\n\r\nI'm opting for either 2 or 3.  3 would be more robust to future changes, but may require more work.  The quick fix would be 2 and then follow up with 3 for the long term solution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1301/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1300","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1300/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1300/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1300/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/1300","id":197310787,"number":1300,"title":"Fixes
