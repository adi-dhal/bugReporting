variable replaced with `ATOMIC_SOURCE_DIR` (which is alias to `Atomic_SOURCE_DIR` provided by cmake). `ATOMIC_SOURCE_DIR` points to root directory of Atomic project just like `CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR` does.\r\n\r\nIntroduced three internal cache variables that provide information to c++ projects that use engine through `add_subdirectory()`:\r\n  * ATOMIC_INCLUDE_DIRS - list of Atomic include directories.\r\n  * ATOMIC_DEFINITIONS - list of Atomic build definitions.\r\n  * ATOMIC_LINK_LIBRARIES - list of Atomic link libraries.\r\n\r\nIntroduced three macros:\r\n  * include_directories_exported() - behaves like `include_directories()`, also appends included directories to `ATOMIC_INCLUDE_DIRS` cache variable.\r\n  * add_definitions_exported() - behaves like `add_definitions()`, also appends added definitions to `ATOMIC_DEFINITIONS` cache variable.\r\n  * add_link_libraries_exported() - appends libraries to `ATOMIC_LINK_LIBRARIES` cache variable. Targets still have to manually link to libraries specified in `ATOMIC_LINK_LIBRARIES` variable.\r\n\r\nMacros are to be used when includes/definitions/libraries should be exposed to game projects linking to engine.\r\n\r\n\r\nSample CMakeLists.txt of project that embeds engine through `add_subdirectory()`:\r\n\r\n    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.6)\r\n    project(AtomicTest)\r\n    \r\n    add_subdirectory(AtomicGameEngine)\r\n    include_directories(${ATOMIC_INCLUDE_DIRS})\r\n    add_definitions(${ATOMIC_DEFINITIONS})\r\n    \r\n    set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS \"${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=c++11\")\r\n    \r\n    set(SOURCE_FILES main.cpp)\r\n    add_executable(AtomicTest ${SOURCE_FILES})\r\n    target_link_libraries (AtomicTest ${ATOMIC_LINK_LIBRARIES})\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. Turns out i slipped in silencing `find_package()` warnings because they were annoying to me. I think these changes are worth having because some of packages are mutually exclusive and project would generate projects no matter configuration. If you think these changes have no place in this PR then let me know and i will fix this

This facilitates a consistent assembly referencing between custom external solutions and generated ones.  It also is a consistent assembly reference for both projects opened by a development build of the editor, as well as a redistributable one.\r\n\r\nIt also cleans up absolute paths being used in csproj, which should make solutions portable across machines.  *Note**: There may still be some cases of absolute paths to flag, I did not test moving the solution across machines.\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty core change, Windows, OSX, Android, iOS, have been tested.  Linux should also work once past CI. \r\n\r\nOne issue introduced by the change to binary references + dependencies instead of project references where they were possible, is that source navigation between the dependent and the project no longer works and instead, since it is now a binary reference, navigation brings you to the binary assembly explorer and not the source.   It is still however possible to trace and setup breakpoints in the development build AtomicNET sources.\r\n\r\nThe external solution test was changed to reference the AtomicNET binary and works both when AtomicNET is available (with debugging) in a development build and when opened from a binary editor installation.  AtomicTool is also able to build the external solution project.\r\n\r\nCloses #1142 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1162","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1162/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1162/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1162/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1162","id":189868059,"number":1162,"title":"[C#] -
