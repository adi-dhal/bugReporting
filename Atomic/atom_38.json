I was sitting on these changes until the Linux PR merged in so I could take those into account.  \n\nThere are some significant changes to the node modules on here though, so take note...some of them may need to be thought about and if they are too invasive it may just be that TSLint doesn't need to be part of the editor build.  A less invasive option would be just to store a tslint.json file in the root and have the Atom editor configured to read it during development, but not throw errors on build.\n\n**Changes**\n- in node 5, the node modules are flattened out to the top level, so now individual modules no longer contain deep hierarchies of duplicate nodes under nested node_modules directories.  This ultimately saves space, but makes your root node_modules much larger.  Pulling in the tslint and typescript modules added to the root of node_modules.  Ideally, `jake` and `fs-extra` should also be updated to do the same.\n- Although you don't want to require npm to build, it might be something to contemplate to reduce the source control size.  There is a way to lock in particular versions of a package via `npm shrinkwrap` and that could be an option to lock down dependencies to the version that you know works ( https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/shrinkwrap )\n- TSLint has a dependency on TypeScript and requires that it be located in the node_modules directory so it can be resolved, so now there is a TypeScript folder under node_modules  as well as in the build directory.  Ideally, the one in node_modules would stay and the other one would be removed.  `BuildCommon.js` has been updated to use the tsc in node_modules.\n- Added a `tslint ignore` option to the generated .d.ts files since they have spacing and content that TSLint doesn't like.  These _should_ be addressed in the future.  The spacing shouldn't be difficult to fix in the generator, but there are a couple instances where the same variable names are used and that will take some analysis. `HTTP-ERROR` `HTTP-INITIALIZING` `HTTP-OPEN` and `HTTP-CLOSED` are duplicates.\n\nLet me know if this is the direction you would like to proceed, or if you would rather a more minimalistic approach.\n\n-Shad\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/544/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/543","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/543/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/543/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/543/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/543","id":123355841,"number":543,"title":"Enable/Disable
