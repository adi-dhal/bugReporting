The new option is AXIS_X, which moves the titlebar to the left side, the closer 'X' moves to the top of the titlebar, and what's left of the title string is at the bottom, though since Turbobadger can't display rotated text, it quickly clips the string.

is a small collection of recent fixes and few additions. Lets go through them:\r\n\r\nCMake version requirement bumped to 3.3. Why you ask? Because noone noticed, but we already depend on that version since we started using `$<$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CXX>:-std=gnu++11>`. `COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CXX` thingy was introduced in 3.3. Older distros may get recent prebuilt CMake binaries from CMake website and they run. Tested with CMake 3.9 on ubuntu 14.04 on travis.ci.\r\n\r\nSeveral build fixes for android NDK 13b. Namely must not link to `pthread` because it does not/no longer exists on android. Also wrapped `-std=gnu++11` into generator expression because otherwise compiler fails building c files due to unknown flag. Also excluded profiler tool from build on android in a way that does not cause any warnings.\r\n\r\n`ImGui::Text(messageText_.CString());` -> `ImGui::TextUnformatted(messageText_.CString());` because again on android it fails to build due to printing user-supplied text as format string being insecure. Clang is really nice, isnt it? ;)\r\n\r\nAdded `IntVector2` constructor taking in float array. No explanation needed here.\r\n\r\nAdded `SetBlockEvents(bool)` and `GetBlockEvents()` to `Object`. This allows us to block certain objects from sending and receiving events. I found it very convenient for implementing game states, but i am sure there are other useful applications. Blocking events is easier than unsubscribing and resubscribing after all.\r\n\r\nAdded `SendEvent(StringHash, const VariantMap&)` overload which allows us to use initializer lists for sending events. For example `SendEvent(\"foo\", { {Foo::P_BAR, \"bar\"}, {Foo::P_FOO, 1} })`. While using this method variant causes extra copy i think there should be a convenience method for cases where speed does not matter.\r\n\r\nThis is a mix of various things, but i think they should be acceptable. If not, and if you think i should split PR up or get rid of some changes please let me know.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1622","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1622/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1622/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1622/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/1622","id":249682703,"number":1622,"title":"Move imgui ui assembly and rendering to END_RENDERING event.

PR adds an Atomic UIButtonGrid widget. This \"widget\" is special. It creates a regular grid of buttons, these buttons will remain in a grid organization, even if the container is resized. It will ellipse \"...\" the text in the buttons if there is not enough room to fully display the text.  This will make it easy to create game menus, and sudoku, tic-tac-toe boards :smile_cat:  There are two methodologies to enter the button text, either by specifying a row and column address, or the \"floodfill\" add text, which tiles in the text sequentially. The embedded UIButtons can be retrieved by both indexing methodologies, so you can assign event handlers to process the button clicks, or by IDs assigned at creation, using the spreadsheet like scheme, having A1 as the first id, and row incrementing letters, and columns incrementing numbers.\r\nI had to do a little plumbing in Turbobadger to get access to the resize information, otherwise, I'd have to make a TB widget and wrap it.\r\n\r\nThis is what it can do for the feature examples ...\r\n```\r\n#if ATOMIC_DESKTOP || ATOMIC_MOBILE  \r\n            var buttonGrid = new UIButtonGrid( 6, 4, 6 );\r\n            buttonGrid.SetLayoutHeight( rootLayout.Rect.Height - 32 );\r\n            buttonGrid.SetLayoutWidth( rootLayout.Rect.Width - 32);\r\n            rootLayout.AddChild( buttonGrid );\r\n            var sampleTypes = typeof(Sample).Assembly.GetTypes().Where(t => t.IsSubclassOf(typeof(Sample)) && t != typeof(Sample) ).ToArray();\r\n            foreach (var sample in sampleTypes)\r\n            {\r\n                int got = buttonGrid.AddGridText ( sample.Name );\r\n                var button = buttonGrid.AtGridWidget(got);\r\n                button.SubscribeToEvent<WidgetEvent>( button,  e => \r\n                {\r\n                    if (e.Type != UI_EVENT_TYPE.UI_EVENT_TYPE_CLICK)  return; // We're only interested in clicks\r\n```\r\n![featuredcs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19511757/28803071-bfe76cf6-760e-11e7-930d-65ecab0916f1.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1617/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1616","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1616/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1616/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1616/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/1616","id":246749617,"number":1616,"title":"MingW-w64 support","user":{"login":"rokups","id":19151258,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/19151258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups","html_url":"https://github.com/rokups","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-07-31T13:06:29Z","updated_at":"2017-08-03T14:18:01Z","closed_at":"2017-08-01T19:36:24Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pulls/1616","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/1616","diff_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/1616.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/1616.patch"},"body":"Engine can now build with MingW-w64.

**OK the Impostors are usable already, this is pretty much the only tasks that matters at this point:**\r\n- [ ] **Make an ImpostorManager component that creates/manages the ImpostorChunk Drawables and get rid of all the statics and the other bullshit! Expose the hardcoded settings, and maybe try to make it a subsystem and expose in the editor (maybe... *maybe* :trollface:)**\r\n\r\n# Generation\r\n- [x] **POSTPONED** ~~generate imposter verts with correct boundaries for object (use aabb proj @ (1,1,1)*thres for max bbs)~~\r\n- [x] generate scaled impostors at the center of the mesh aabb\r\n- [ ] provide alternative projections to maximize texture utilization: no correction, pythagoras, naive\r\n- [ ] render using real alpha (not bg color) and anti-aliasing\r\n- [ ] generate normal maps (how to get normals gbuffer to convert to cam space)?\r\n- [ ] generate shadow maps\r\n- [x] check whether cache exists and skip generation\r\n- [ ] skip ~~top and~~ bottom rows, overflow uv in the shader to compensate - related to the proj from below task\r\n- [ ] 'solidify'/'bleed' imposter textures so it doesn't ipo to black on the borders\r\n- [ ] optionally bake pbr maps like metalness and albedo and use true pbr rendering for imposters (depends on some tasks above)\r\n\r\n# General\r\n- [ ] use a separated frustum for the imposters, so we can decrease the normal view frustum far plane distance considerable, so we have less nodes in the frustum to check their distance\r\n- [ ] make it easy to configure draw distance, transition range, uv tiles qty, chunk size (hard coded)\r\n- [ ] optionally pass uv tile qty in the vbo to allow varying tiles in a single texture array\r\n- [ ] provide independent impostor systems for different resolutions because texture arrays aren't jagged, so if object sizes vary a lot, small objects could use smaller textures, e.g: buildings and props like crates\r\n- [ ] temporal transition?\r\n- [ ] provide a better way to configure ambient light and to pass the main light that doesn't require you to pass them for each node\r\n- [ ] check if caches are updated/relevant and not just if they exist\r\n\r\n# Aligned\r\n- [x] create discrete chunks of vbos (static)\r\n- [x] pass x, y, z, yangle to the shader TODO: do this properly\r\n- [x] calculate vertices positions in the vertex shader\r\n- [x] calculate uv tile in the vertex shader\r\n- [x] zero vbo vertices of billboards that shouldn't be displayed\r\n- [x] create and dispose vbos\r\n- [x] cull vbos using aabbs\r\n- [x] fix dumb mistake in which we're calculating the imposter rot from the camera quaternion thus causing problems with things like camera shake... either pass a quat specifically for imposter orientation, calculate a y ord quat in the shader (camPos->impPos vec)... or maybe correct camera local z rot\r\n- [x] ~~fix projection directly from below (UV flips, prolly low prior)~~\r\n- [x] **WORKAROUNDED - CUTOUT** fix alpha problem - alpha of impostors is clearing other impostors on the same chunk\r\n- [x] dithered blending so we don't have to deal with sorting\r\n- [x] pass imposter rotation on y in ~~radians~~ *revolutions* in the vbo\r\n- [x] bake object uniform scale in the vbo data\r\n- [x] store and shift origin of the imposter to match object and use aabb to save texture space\r\n- [x] pass texture array layer in the vbo ~~(mask with the above in 32bit)~~\r\n- [x] correct rotation based on euler y angle input so we don't pass a quat in the vbo\r\n- [x] use a 'faderange' or 'fadestart' shader constant in the vertex shader and calculate a 'transition' amount\r\n- [x] use the transition amount in the pixel shader to apply a dither effect\r\n\r\n# Planar\r\nPlanar billboards for billions of trees seen approximately from the same height (or at least from relatively shallow view angles)\r\n- [x] planar imposter orientation with as few math ops as possible\r\n- [ ] render multiple trees on the same texture, one for each row\r\n- [ ] allow some extra projection heights and skew the top vertices accordingly\r\n- [ ] study advantages of passing a start index for the UV tile so you don't have to map one row per object... maybe use a 'objectColumns' variable instead\r\n\r\n# Free Billboards\r\nTODO\r\n- [] **POSTPONED**~~shift quads origins (y) in the vbo static data to correct origins when they're not centered (we need this to use as much space from the texture as possible... generally objects origins are on the center-bottom so if we don't do this we'd lose about half the texture area... there's no correction for X/Z though, so if say the origin of a cube is at one of its vertices it still won't be terribly efficient in terms of texture space.~~\r\n- [] **POSTPONED**~~origin shift in the shader to correct local origin as passed in the vbo~~\r\n\r\n# Optimization / Extras\r\n- [] ~~for special usages when chunks should be smaller, merge them together to have a min/max number of imposters (very low priority since it's a very unlikely scenario)~~ UPD: dyn batch works\r\n- [] make sure dynamic batching won't ruin it, some scenarios to check: large vbos being merged, TODO\r\n- Research using sparse virtual textures instead of just texture arrays and page

chunk","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1601/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1600","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1600/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1600/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1600/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1600","id":242069386,"number":1600,"title":"[Build]
