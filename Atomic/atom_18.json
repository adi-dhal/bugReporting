an editor built from source on Windows (CMake_VS2015.bat, followed by building Atomic.sln), when generating an AtomicNET solution for a C# project will:\r\n-Generate AtomicNET.* source projects into the project\r\n-Generate AtomicProject.* projects, including AtomicProject.Desktop which has a dependency on AtomicNET.Desktop and will output artifacts to a /Debug directory, including the AtomicNET.dll generated by AtomicNET.Desktop\r\n-Generate a solution with both projects\r\n\r\nA distributable editor built with Build_AtomicEditor.bat on the other hand will:\r\n-Generate AtomicProject.* projects, including AtomicProject,Desktop, with a dependency on a precompiled AtomicNET.dll in the editor install location, using an absolute path and will output artifacts to a /Release directory, including the referenced AtomicNET.dll\r\n-Generate a solution with just these projects\r\n\r\nThis inconsistency makes moving between editor builds problematic, and also makes it impossible to have external projects that reliably reference the same AtomicNET.dll as AtomicProject.*, complicating commandline build processes.\r\n\r\nTo solve this I'd like to suggest the following:\r\nFor an editor build from source:\r\n-Still generate AtomicNET.* source projects into the project, but have them output to a consistent location such as AtomicNET/Lib, regardless of build configuration (Debug/Release)\r\n-Have generated AtomicProject.Desktop project reference the dll in AtomicNET/Lib, instead of directly referencing the project, but set AtomicNET.Desktop as a build dependency\r\n-Still generate a solution with all projects\r\n\r\nFor a distributable editor:\r\n-When generating AtomicNET projects, copy AtomicNET.dll to AtomicNET/Lib within the project\r\n-Have generated AtomicProject.Desktop project reference the dll in AtomicNET/Lib, instead of directly referencing the the dll in the editor install location\r\n-Still generate a solution with just

you start the AtomicEditor, a mono + AtomicNETService.exe is also started, this is expected. On linux, when you close the editor, the AtomicNETService.exe is not stopped, so they hang around. Subsequent AtomicEditors start another AtomicNETService.exe and so on. \nOSX and Windows do not appear to have this problem. Im hoping @CTrauma can test this on linux distros other than Mint, to see how big the problem really is. \n   In diagnosing the problem, I'm finding that AtomicNETService.exe process is never told to send the event to engine it is running, to exit. It has a case in it's command loop to do this. Perhaps the process that is suppose to send this dies quicker on linux than other platforms, or they are suppose to be stopped some other
