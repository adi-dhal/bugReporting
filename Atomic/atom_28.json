Also testing in Windows (and Linux when the webviews work) since I've pretty much been doing this in OSX land.\n### Changes\n- New menu item Developer->Plugins->TypeScript->Compile on Save: on/off\n  Clicking on this will toggle compile on save on or off which will compile the currently edited file when you save.  This value is persisted in your project preferences file.\n- New menu item Developer->Plugins->TypeScript->Compile\n  Clicking on this will compile all of the TypeScript in your project directory and display the results\n- Updated the Web View command: EDITOR_SAVE_FILE to allow the web view to pass up a fully qualified path/filename and file contents and it will get saved to the filesystem.  I added in protections that will ignore the request if the filename/path does not reside within the project directory, or the filename/path contains \"..\" which could allow saving a file outside the directory.  Since theoretically, the web view could be pointed to an editor on the internet, it just adds a little safety\n- The TypeScript compiler will first look for an Atomic.d.ts in the project directory and if it doesn't find one, will use the one in the app data folder.  This opens up the ability to have projects that are always up to date with the Atomic.d.ts.  However, if you want to use an external editor, you will still need to copy the Atomic.d.ts in\n- If there is a tsconfig.json file in the root of the project, the extension will pull it in and add any additional files within the [files] section that the editor isn't aware of.\n### Open issues\n- Currently the Compile menu will only work if a web view editor is open since the TypeScript language service lives inside a web worker attached to the web views.  I experimented around with dynamically instantiating a web view from the editor script, but it doesn't appear the AtomicQuery is available from those dynamic web views.  The idea would be that if there isn't a web view open, an off-screen one could be loaded and used to compile\n- For compiler errors, there isn't a way to click on the error and open and jump to that line...maybe as an enhancement in a later PR\n- Currently you will need to compile your typescript prior to building/running.  It should be pretty easy to hook into the Project Start Player event to do that, but it would be nice to have the off-screen compiler working first\n- A nice to have would be a menu that allows you to update your in-project copy of Atomic.d.ts with the latest from the app.\n\nPhew!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/835/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/834","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/834/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/834/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/834/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/834","id":158184342,"number":834,"title":"Document setting up QtCreator4 for Atomic development on Windows","user":{"login":"maconbot","id":1652115,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1652115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maconbot","html_url":"https://github.com/maconbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maconbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maconbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maconbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maconbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maconbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maconbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maconbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maconbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maconbot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":17,"created_at":"2016-06-02T16:29:42Z","updated_at":"2016-06-08T20:05:12Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Bookending issue with the relevant details for easy on eyes.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1652115/15770732/1d891b28-2923-11e6-8085-11b87b5d2ffe.png)\n\nthankfully, QtCreator gave me the correct location of the c/cpp compiler as seen in picture above.\nC:\\Dev\\Atomic32Bit\\AtomicGameEngine>call \"%VS140COMNTOOLS%....\\VC\\bin\\amd64\\cl.\nexe\"\n\nthe bat file references \"amd64\\vcvars.bat\" which errors out.\n\n**Similar issues** and concerns on user experience and building from source has been mentioned on _5 counts: **709, 555, 556 and forum comments 764, 731**_\n\nnote below several posts is a fantastic list of common cmake woes, i suggest we copy paste give credit and drop in a Troubleshooting area.
