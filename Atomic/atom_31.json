It was needed because of the problem when adding planar models to the scene. \n\nHow it Works:\n1. Create an Import.json file in the Settings Folder of your project.\n2. The Import.json allows you to set each of the postprocess flags to true or false. This is what it looks like:\n\n```\n{\n  \"desktop\": {\n\n    \"aiFlagsDefault\" : {\n      \"convertToLeftHanded\" : true,\n      \"joinIdenticalVertices\" : true,\n      \"triangulate\" : true, \n      \"genSmoothNormals\" : true,\n      \"limitBoneWeights\" : true,\n      \"improveCacheLocality\" : true,\n      \"fixInfacingNormals\" : false,\n      \"findInvalidData\" : true,\n      \"genUVCoords\" : true,\n      \"findInstances\" : true,\n      \"optimizeMeshes\" : true\n    }\n  }\n\n}\n```\n\nNB: If there isn't an Import.json in the Settings folder of the game, the engine will set the flags to its default behaviour (where everything is true).\n\nIs this okay? Please let me know if there is anything you'd like to be different. \n\n-Raheel\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/746","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/746/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/746/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/746/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/746","id":146295449,"number":746,"title":"Issue #691 Profiler should exclude data from profiler output","user":{"login":"weinandvv","id":16757017,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/16757017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinandvv","html_url":"https://github.com/weinandvv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinandvv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinandvv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinandvv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinandvv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinandvv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinandvv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinandvv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinandvv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weinandvv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-04-06T12:10:50Z","updated_at":"2016-09-17T15:16:13Z","closed_at":"2016-09-17T15:16:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pulls/746","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/746","diff_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/746.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/746.patch"},"body":"Divided the triangles into categories \"All pass\", \"Single pass\" and \"Editor\" (D3D9Graphics.cpp & h, DebugHud.cpp & h, Renderer.cpp & h, View.cpp)\n\nCreated a profiler widget to be added to the scene that lets you view the information easier when a scene is open (DebugHud.cpp & h, ResourceEditor.cpp & h, SceneEditor3D.cpp & h, SceneView.cpp, skin.tb.txt, UI.cpp)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/745","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/745/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/745/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/745/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/745","id":146087835,"number":745,"title":"Editor -
