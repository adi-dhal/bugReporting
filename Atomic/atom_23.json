is a pretty major update to JS object lifetime, which cleans up a number of systems most notably UI widgets and Nodes  I have tested with existing projects and examined lifetime using the new JSVM:: DumpJavascriptObjects() method.  Though, script lifetimes are tricky and there are likely bugs which will need fixing.\n\nThere are a number of bugs also addressed with the recent Urho 1.6 update. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/965","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/965/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/965/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/965/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/965","id":171491209,"number":965,"title":"Joystick Rumble support 954","user":{"login":"JimMarlowe","id":19511757,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/19511757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimMarlowe","html_url":"https://github.com/JimMarlowe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimMarlowe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimMarlowe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimMarlowe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimMarlowe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimMarlowe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimMarlowe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimMarlowe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimMarlowe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimMarlowe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-08-16T18:57:00Z","updated_at":"2016-08-17T00:51:21Z","closed_at":"2016-08-17T00:51:21Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pulls/965","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/965","diff_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/965.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/965.patch"},"body":"This PR adds rumble support for joysticks and game controllers. It also enables user configuration of unhandled game controllers to make them behave in a standardized way.\nThe rumble support is self initializing, the user does not have to make any calls to use the rumble. There is one convenience call to ask if rumble is supported on the joystick/controller. The main call is :\nvoid JoystickRumble(unsigned int id, float strength, unsigned int length); /// produce rumble\n    The id argument is what gets passed into the event handlers as the JoystickId, not the index, though they are often the same.\n    The strength argument is a float from 0.0 to 1.0 and is the magnitude of the rumble event.\n    The length argument is the number of milliseconds to play the rumble event.\n\nThe test program and example usage are delayed until the joystick event handlers stabilize.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/965/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4395","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507250212","x-github-request-id":"DDC4:572C:16949B4:2CD8216:59D6CDD7","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/29790707/issues?state=all&page=24>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/29790707/issues?state=all&page=56>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/29790707/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/29790707/issues?state=all&page=22>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"284d79635508720c1e87a7f9137dc8b5\"","status":"200 OK"}}
