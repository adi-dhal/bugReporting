@JoshEngebretson, \n\n@raheelx and I have implemented a solution to issue #497: Provide a way to jump to objects referenced in the inspector.\n\nThese are our concerns:\n- EditField Components trigger events onFocusChanged --> We would prefer it onClick.\n- The ScrollTo implementation in the ProjectFrame.ts might be unnecessarily complicated.\n- Animation components in array widget are not referencing.\n\nBesides these concerns our solution is functional. :) Please let us know what you

converts the editor code that lives inside the WebView to typescript to set the stage for further work. \n\n In order to do this, Typescript needed to be upgraded to version 1.8 in order to bundle the code into a single file.  There is also a dependency on https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs which is a module loader for the web that is supported by the typescript configuration option: `module: \"system\"`\n\nThe code has a single entrypoint called interop.ts which sets up the functions on `window` that the host needs to be able to reference.  Any api calls the client can call or the host can call should be placed into that interop file and wired up to the `window` object as necessary.\n\nAdditionally, since CEF now supports the ES6 spec, the code that is being emitted is emitted as ES6 javascript.  This allows for native support of some of the es6 features such as fat arrows, promises, etc.\n\nFinally, TS 1.8 detected some errors in the editor that were not caught in 1.7x, so those were
