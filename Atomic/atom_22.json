Documentation on the debugger api can be found at https://github.com/svaarala/duktape/blob/master/doc/debugger.rst\n\nThe API is built in, but needs some setup in order to use it.  There is an example of exposing this through a socket interface, allowing a remote debugger to attach and walk through the code.  An example transport can be found here: https://github.com/svaarala/duktape/tree/master/examples/debug-trans-socket\n\nIn addition, there is currently a plugin for VSCode that will consume this socket interface and allow for stepping through your code through VSCode.  The plugin is located at https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HaroldBrenes.duk-debug\n\nI believe this should be broken out into a couple of tasks:\n- [ ] Implement the duktape socket transport debug interface into the player so that it can be attached to by either the node.js based debugger provided by Duktape, or the VSCode plugin\n- [ ] Determine if it's beneficial to bring the ability to debug into the core editor and then determine the best way to wire it up to the embedded Monaco editor.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/999/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/998","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/998/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/998/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/998/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/998","id":175601412,"number":998,"title":"Updated
