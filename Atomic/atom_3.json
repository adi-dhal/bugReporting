Since we had no common commits with Urho3D merges were done manually. This changes now. git 2.1.0 introduced feature that allows us to fake parents of commits. We merged with upstream last time at commit 404afffddfa02a77101af6c6c4f9b534db12e66c. Commit message says we merged with upstream commit `129205a9b1fd94573c81feba76f897990990e8ec` and this commit does not exist in atomic repo. Using `git replace --graft 404afffddfa02a77101af6c6c4f9b534db12e66c c0a700c2b428a22a92cac18e473c68c180730f63 129205a9b1fd94573c81feba76f897990990e8ec` i faked parent of 404afffddfa02a77101af6c6c4f9b534db12e66c to point to `129205a9b1fd94573c81feba76f897990990e8ec`. Now git has a reference point for merges.\r\n\r\nHow to merge from upstream (after this merges):\r\n\r\n1. Configure git repository: `git config merge.renameLimit 1000000`. This sets rename detection limit high as atomic repository exceeds default limit. Do it once per repository, new checked out repositories need that set manually. If you forget it - no big deal as you will get error reminding of it.\r\n2. Add new git remote pointing to Urho3D repository, lets call it `upstream`.\r\n3. Fetch `upstream/master`.\r\n4. Check out any atomic branch. ⚠️ Do not check out Urho3D branches ⚠️ \r\n5. Merge from `upstream/master`, `git merge --squash upstream/master`.\r\n\r\nThis will merge changes as usual. Only new changes since last common commit will be merged. You will have to solve some conflicts in case same code was modified in atomic and upstream. Git figures out renames automatically as well, you do not have to care about it. This even removes need of `// ATOMIC BEGIN|END` comments as atomic changes are preserved and diffs from upstream are replayed on atomic code.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to try this method on your own do this:\r\n\r\n1. Check out a new branch.\r\n2. Run `git replace --graft 404afffddfa02a77101af6c6c4f9b534db12e66c c0a700c2b428a22a92cac18e473c68c180730f63 129205a9b1fd94573c81feba76f897990990e8ec`, it inserts fake parent for previous sync with upstream.\r\n3. Follow steps in the list above.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1586/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1585","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1585/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1585/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1585/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1585","id":239312041,"number":1585,"title":"[Web Player] Failing build for web_player on windows.","user":{"login":"Mustard867","id":7064305,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7064305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mustard867","html_url":"https://github.com/Mustard867","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mustard867/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mustard867/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mustard867/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mustard867/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mustard867/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mustard867/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mustard867/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mustard867/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mustard867/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"JoshEngebretson","id":376203,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/376203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshEngebretson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"JoshEngebretson","id":376203,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/376203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshEngebretson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-06-28T22:07:38Z","updated_at":"2017-06-30T13:25:00Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"OS: Windows 10 Build 16215.rs_prerelease\r\nAtomicGameEngine version: master branch (as of 06/28/2017)\r\n\r\nI managed to get the webplayer building a few days ago on Windows.

With this, you can make a menubar enabled program with ease.\r\nIt also exposes two embedded functions for Typescript usage, onChanged() and onEvent().  Others (@Nyt0x, un PR'd) have defined onChanged as `onChanged: (data:any) => void;`, but I don't see anywhere actually filling in the event structure, so I left it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## UIPulldownMenu\r\nThis is a simplified Pulldown menu widget for user applications. It can be programmed by a .ui.txt layout file, or thru api, with a UISelectItemSource. It is designed to use the EVENT_TYPE_CHANGED event to inform when a menu entry has been selected. This event can be utilized in Javascript/Typescript code with the onChanged() function, and with C#,C++,  subscribe to the WidgetEvent, and check for EVENT_TYPE_CHANGED event type. You don't get the selected entry directly (for many reasons), so you have to ask the UIPulldownMenu which entry(ID) caused the CHANGED event. And, remember to fill out the id fields on the menu entries, or there won't be any ids to retrieve.\r\n\r\nJJ/TS snippet\r\n```\r\n// in JS/TS\r\nvar filemenu = layout.getWidget(\"FileMenu\");\r\nfilemenu.onChanged = function () \r\n{\r\n    Atomic.print ( \"FileMenu selected = \" + filemenu.getSelectedId() ); \r\n    if ( filemenu.getSelectedId() === \"FileExit\" ) Atomic.engine.exit();\r\n};\r\n\r\n```\r\nC# snippet\r\n```\r\n// and with C#\r\nAtomicEngine.UIPulldownMenu filemenu = (AtomicEngine.UIPulldownMenu)layout.GetWidget(\"FileMenu\");\r\nfilemenu.SubscribeToEvent<WidgetEvent>(filemenu, ev =>\r\n{\r\n    if (ev.Type == UI_EVENT_TYPE.UI_EVENT_TYPE_CHANGED)\r\n    {\r\n        string myitem = filemenu.GetSelectedId();\r\n        Log.Info(\"FileMenu selected = \" + myitem);\r\n        if ( myitem == \"FileExit\" ) GetSubsystem<Engine>().Exit();\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nsample_layout.ui.txt file\r\n```\r\n\r\n# UIPulldownMenu demo layout file\r\nTBLayout: axis: y, size: available, distribution: available\r\n\tTBLayout: axis: x, id: Menubar, margin: 5, size: preferred, distribution: gravity, distribution-position: left right, skin: TBWindow\r\n\t\tTBPulldownMenu: text: \"File\", skin: 0, id: \"FileMenu\"\r\n\t\t\titems:\r\n\t\t\t\titem: text: \"Open...\", id: FileOpen\r\n\t\t\t\titem: text: \"Save...\", id: FileSave\r\n\t\t\t\titem: text: \"-\"\r\n\t\t\t\titem: text: \"Exit\", id: FileExit\r\n\t\tTBPulldownMenu: text: \"Edit\", skin: 0, id: \"EditMenu\"\r\n\t\t\titems:\r\n\t\t\t\titem: text: \"Cut\", id: EditCut\r\n\t\t\t\titem: text: \"Copy\", id: EditCopy\r\n\t\t\t\titem: text: \"Paste\", id: EditPaste\r\n\t\t\t\titem: text: \"Delete\", id: EditDelete\r\n\t\t\t\titem: text: \"-\"\r\n\t\t\t\titem: text: \"Select All\", id: EditAll\r\n\t\tTBPulldownMenu: text: \"View\", skin: 0, id: \"ViewMenu\"\r\n\t\t\titems:\r\n\t\t\t\titem: text: \"Scale\", id: ViewScale\r\n\t\t\t\titem: text: \"Rotate\", id: ViewRotate\r\n\t\t\t\titem: text: \"Translate\", id: ViewTranslate\r\n\t\tTBPulldownMenu: text: \"Help\", skin: 0, id: \"HelpMenu\"\r\n\t\t\titems:\r\n\t\t\t\titem: text: \"Help...\", id: HelpHelp\r\n\t\t\t\titem: text: \"About this program...\", id: HelpAbout\r\n\tTBWidget\r\n\tTBWidget\r\n\tTBWidget\r\n\tTBWidget\r\n\tTBButton: text: Press me!\r\n\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1570/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1569","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1569/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1569/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1569/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1569","id":236720105,"number":1569,"title":"[C#] Add Color to initial Component field initialization","user":{"login":"JoshEngebretson","id":376203,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/376203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshEngebretson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-06-18T13:07:48Z","updated_at":"2017-06-18T13:08:47Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The Color type is missing from the initial C# Component initialization.
