is just a combination of small changes that I discovered while trying to put together a tutorial for creating a menu extension.\r\n- Updated the service locator sendEvent method signature to use the new event system\r\n- Changed the extensions to all descend from Atomic.ScriptObject so that they can be event listeners/senders (which effectively deprecates the sendEvent method in the service locator)\r\n- Modified the extension loader to clear any previously loaded extensions from the ```require``` cache when closing and re-opening a project.  Otherwise it was not loading the changes and required you to exit the editor entirely.\r\n- fix for not trying to compile previously transpiled js files.  JS files will only be put into the TS transpiler if they are true js files and not transpiled from ts.\r\n- Send notifications to the status bar when transpiling typescript. Thanks @JimMarlowe! 👍 \r\n- modified the output of the TS transpiler so that it looks good in both dark theme and light theme.\r\n- fixed an issue where clicking an error in the transpiled output wouldn't always navigate to the line in the editor\r\n- fixed an issue where the file extension was not automatically being appended to a new file if the filename had dots in it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1450","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1450/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1450/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1450/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/1450","id":208328571,"number":1450,"title":"Add

It will automagically provide the thumbnail tooltip for .png, .jpg assets in a project's Texture directory.  There is also support for using thumbnails for .prefab, .mdl and .fbx assets.   To add a thumbnail for an asset is \"easy\". The user can create a new directory in the project root directory (where Resources and Cache are) called Support.   A (png) thumbnail for an asset is named assetname.ext.png, where assetname.ext is what you would see in the Project browser. Then, when you hover over assetname.ext, the thumbnail tooltip will appear. If no thumbnail is created for the asset, then nothing will appear.\r\nNormal text tooltips are unaffected, for a thumbail tooltip, the 1st character in the string is a  \"#\" character, followed by a pathname to the image to display. The Texture based images in the project will show the actual image files, as defined by the asset. The other type assets are redirected to the Support directory to look for custom thumbnail images.\r\nThe reason the Project/Support directory is selected to hold the thumbnails, is so they don’t effect the asset system, they are not needed for deploying the game, but they are relevant to the project.\r\n\r\nOH NO 35 lines
