The editor player is passed the flag thru the command line, so that is transparent to the user. \n   For the linux standalone player, the user will have to change the Settings/Engine.json file manually to set the ForceGL2 flag, there is no way to do that automatically, since the user has to know that they need the Settings directory.\n   This processing is automatic, so the user does not have to do anything, whether they have the problem or not. If they upgrade their Mesa Libs to a version that does not have the problem, it will fix itself, with the one execution lag.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/910/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/909","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/909/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/909/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/909/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/909","id":163972557,"number":909,"title":"Expose fontFamily to the monaco editor prefs","user":{"login":"shaddockh","id":2951562,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2951562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh","html_url":"https://github.com/shaddockh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-07-06T00:04:42Z","updated_at":"2016-07-06T01:23:01Z","closed_at":"2016-07-06T01:23:01Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pulls/909","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/909","diff_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/909.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/909.patch"},"body":"@JoshEngebretson , I've quickly exposed `fontFamily` to the monaco prefs.
