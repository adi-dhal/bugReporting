currently try to compile the source on linux (Mint 17/Ubuntu 14.10) and I am documenting what is needed to compile on linux.\n\nAs far I have done following changes(and in this order) to succesfully build:\n- _libCpuId_ `typedef redefinition with different types ('long' vs 'long long')`\n  I removed their definition(libcpuid_types.h) of int64_t as sys/types.h already has this type. \n- _TurboBadger_ `use of undeclared identifier 'nullptr'`\n  Definitely a missing -std=c++11. Added in the generated flags.make\n- _Atomic/Graphics/_ `'d3d9.h' file not found`\n  I do not know why it was choosen to work on DirectX so I added a -DATOMIC_OPENGL in the corresponding flags.make.\n- _Atomic/Environment/ProcSky.cpp_ `unknown type name 'uint8_t'`\n  I added the commented lines\n\n```\n#if defined(_MSC_VER)\n#include \"stdint.h\"\n// #else\n// #include <stdint.h>\n#endif\n```\n- _Several kNet header_ `error: unknown type name 'sockaddr_in'`\n  Add some points the `#if defined(KNET_UNIX)` seemed not the be taken although in the flags.make it is defined. So I changed to no condition.\n- _JSBind/cplusplus_ `no template named 'unordered_map' in namespace 'std'; did you mean 'std::tr1::unordered_map'?` and `'auto' type specifier is a C++11 extension`\n  Added a missing -std=c++11 to the flags.make\n\nBut now I stuck at the following point: Linking CXX executable JSBind\nIt lacks on several linkings against the following libraries: \n- GL\n- GLEW\n- DL\n- pthread\n- rt\n\nI tried to add these as CXX_FLAGS but it did not change anything. Same undefined reference errors on gl_*, glew_*, sem_*, pthread_*, dl_*\n\nCan anyone help me to fix these linkings?\n\nFYI: I am not used to configure cmake makefiles so I do not know whether I change things at the right point. C(++) compiler is clang(++).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/56/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/55","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/55/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/55/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/55/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/55","id":66215298,"number":55,"title":"Adjust/Fix
