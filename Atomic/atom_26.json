Namely:\n\n```\nResourceCache.getResource<T>\nResourceCache.getTempResource<T>\nResourceCache.getExistingResource<T>\nUI.getWidgetAt<T>\nUIWidget.getWidget<T>\n```\n\nThe other thing this PR does is allow for `export default <classname>` which is used in `ES6` and `TypeScript` which closes #845.  The project templates have been updated to use `export default` for the `TypeScript` projects as this is a cleaner and more preferable way of doing things.\n\n@JoshEngebretson can you double check the C++ changes?  They work, but I'm still getting my bearings in C++ and there could be a better way of handling that.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/877/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/876","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/876/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/876/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/876/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/876","id":160784972,"number":876,"title":"Adding
