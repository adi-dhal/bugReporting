provides a dropdown on the new project / clone example project dialog to specify which source code language to generate the project for.  Associated with #495.\n\nNotable changes:\n- Added a dropdown to the create project dialog that is fed from entries in the JSON configuration for the template\n- created a JSON configuration file for the standard templates (2d, 3d, empty)\n- updated the JSON configuration file for the examples to use the new structure \n- specified that the Roboman3d example can have a JavaScript and TypeScript target\n- created TypeScript versions of the 3 standard project types\n- modified the way that the templates get copied.  Now, instead of just the resources folder getting copied, the entire folder gets copied and a cache folder generated.  The .atomic file then gets renamed\n- More languages can easily be added by just updating the template configuration in the JSON (ie, C#, C++, etc)\n- The TypeScript example projects store the .ts files alongside the .js files instead of storing them in a separate source directory.  When the TypeScript gets compiled, it will just overwrite the .js file of the same name.\n\nQuestions:\nThere are a few things that may need to be discussed\n1) the *.d.ts files for the typescript examples are just stored in the template.  Would it be better to auto-update them on editor build?\n2) the editor currently doesn't view .ts files, just .js files.  When the editor pulls in the Chromium framework, would it be possible to display different languages or should the editor go ahead and allow display of .ts files as is?\n3) Once number 2 is resolved, that opens up the ability to have the New Component/New Script menu item generate a stub file in the appropriate language.\n4) Is there a format for the .atomic project file?  I would like to store the source code language for the project in that file so other elements of the editor can get at it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/498","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/498/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/498/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/498/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/498","id":121757270,"number":498,"title":"Adding

For example if a diffuse texture is missing, the last set diffuse texture is used. On some objects this may not be obvious as the missing settings may still fit in the scene.\n\nIdeally, a standard \"something is wrong\" set of render settings should be used when something is incorrectly set up. Either a bright untextured material with a solid colour vertex unlikely to be used in a normal object (magenta, lime green) or a simple unlit diffuse material with a material that includes text indicating what is wrong.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/492/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/491","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/491/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/491/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/491/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/491","id":121182373,"number":491,"title":"No \"Material\" label next to material selection in submesh inspector","user":{"login":"mattbenic","id":278871,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/278871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic","html_url":"https://github.com/mattbenic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"rsredsq","id":5163918,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5163918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsredsq","html_url":"https://github.com/rsredsq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsredsq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsredsq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsredsq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsredsq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsredsq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsredsq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsredsq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsredsq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsredsq/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"rsredsq","id":5163918,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5163918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsredsq","html_url":"https://github.com/rsredsq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsredsq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsredsq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsredsq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsredsq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsredsq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsredsq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsredsq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsredsq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsredsq/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-12-09T07:55:02Z","updated_at":"2015-12-11T21:26:48Z","closed_at":"2015-12-11T21:26:48Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"There is no label for the material selection field when viewing a list of submeshes.
