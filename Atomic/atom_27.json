This could be accomplished by having a new var type called: `Atomic.VAR_CUSTOM` or `Atomic.VAR_JSON` that could be defined with a key that indicates which custom editor to use.\n\nAn example might be something like\n\n```\ninspectorFields = {\n  jsonField: [Atomic.VAR_JSON, \"{}\"],\n  customField: [Atomic.VAR_CUSTOM, [\"MyEditorName\", \"{}\"]]\n}\n```\n\nFor a `VAR_JSON` a free-form text entry field could pop up to be edited and then saved back into the object.  For a `VAR_CUSTOM`, an inspector registered with the provided editor name could pop up.  If that editor doesn't exist, then maybe the JSON editor could pop up.  Both of these editors would read and write JSON data to/from the field.\n\nIn order to provide custom inspectors, the logic that determines which inspector widget to use for each field would need to be tweaked to use some kind of registry or locator and then this could be exposed to editor extensions that could add additional widgets to this registry.\n\nWhen instantiating these fields on a custom JSComponent, the stored JSON would need to be parsed back into object form and attached to the field on the JSComponent.  This would allow the component at run-time to be able to interact with a fleshed out object and not need to parse the values beforehand.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/870/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/869","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/869/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/869/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/869/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/869","id":160544630,"number":869,"title":"Basic editing key bindings for Linux","user":{"login":"JimMarlowe","id":19511757,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/19511757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimMarlowe","html_url":"https://github.com/JimMarlowe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimMarlowe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimMarlowe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimMarlowe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimMarlowe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimMarlowe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimMarlowe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimMarlowe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimMarlowe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimMarlowe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-06-15T23:12:44Z","updated_at":"2016-06-15T23:47:59Z","closed_at":"2016-06-15T23:47:59Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pulls/869","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/869","diff_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/869.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/869.patch"},"body":"Add the arrow, backspace, delete to the Linux Ace editor, making for an enjoyable editing experience.\nTo say CEF support for linux is a little weak would not be an understatement.

been working on getting a headless build working on Windows using a clean Windows10 VM and then installing git, cmake, and vcbuildtools with Chocolatey as a way of having a relatively lightweight way to build in Windows.\n\nThe build fails because atlbase.h is included in AtomicGameEngine/Source/ThirdParty/nativefiledialog/nfd_win.cpp. Which use to be in the PSDK then removed, and then use to be in the DDK then removed and now it isn't in the vcbuildtools or VS Express either.\n\nSo after spending way more time than I would like to admit trying to find a clean way to pull the 1mb of files out of a 650mb iso of the old DDK from microsoft downloads I got frustrated and commented it out to see what the 'actual' dependencies were... and there aren't any, the file is just dependency rot.\n\nI can either submit a PR back to the original project, which already has a healthy list of forgotten PRs or submit a PR to the ThirdParty sources here.\n\nI think removing it is worth doing so there can be a lightweight build alternative for folks who don't need the full visual studio space hog install, and also makes it easy to automate the creation of a build environment which might help on-boarding with people new to building.\n\nThoughts..?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/868/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/867","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/867/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/867/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/867/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/867","id":160469223,"number":867,"title":"[NEW

Until there is a dedicated extensible user settings dialog, this is going to need to be hand-edited for now (I'll add an issue for creating a settings dialog)\n\nCurrently the following settings are exposed in `userprefs.json`\n\n``` json\n  \"codeEditorSettings\": {\n    \"theme\": \"ace/theme/monokai\",\n    \"keyboardHandler\": \"ace/keyboard/textinput\",\n    \"fontSize\": 12,\n    \"showInvisibles\": false,\n    \"useSoftTabs\": true,\n    \"tabSize\": 2\n  }\n```\n\nI reworked the way settings are exposed to the web view and instead of having the web view request the settings through an AJAX call, the settings are placed onto the WebHost global properties.  This allows them to be available as soon as possible so that when the editor configures itself, it can get the settings.  I also modified the notification for preferences changes and just send a simple notification message that the values in the WebHost global have been updated.  This is a lot less chatty and actually feels like a cleaner implementation.\n\n@JimMarlowe - this should give you the ACE configuration part of the skin updates you are looking at.\n\nI contemplated having editor settings for each file type, but I think until there is dedicated UI for it, it could get too complex.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/856/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/855","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/855/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/855/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/855/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/855","id":159577924,"number":855,"title":"New features request: Mesh Painter","user":{"login":"JimSEOW","id":8244633,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8244633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimSEOW","html_url":"https://github.com/JimSEOW","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimSEOW/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimSEOW/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimSEOW/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimSEOW/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimSEOW/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimSEOW/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimSEOW/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimSEOW/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimSEOW/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-06-10T07:46:49Z","updated_at":"2016-06-10T07:46:49Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I found a series of youtube videos on Mesh Painter.
