PR makes the UISelectList a little more useful. There is a lot of data hiding going on between the UISelectList and the UISelectItemSource, as far as I can tell you can only program a UISelectList with a UISelectItemSource. Once the UISelectItemSource is created and then leave the scope, you cant get the UISelectItemSource back out of the UISelectList. But, there is an internal TBSelectItemSource that the UISelectList uses to do the drawing and stuff, and I can find that, and return the strings that you can _clearly_ see... \r\nThe added methods are :\r\n``const String& UISelectList::GetItemString(int index);``\r\nand\r\n``const String& UISelectList::GetSelectedItemString();``\r\nand they pass thru the script bindings without issue. Example code snippet :\r\n```\r\nif ( ev.target.id == \"myselectlist\") {\r\n   var selectlist = <Atomic.UISelectList>this.mahWindow.getWidget(ev.target.id);\r\n   var selected = selectlist.getValue();\r\n   Atomic.print ( \"Atomic.UISelectList selected item = \" + selected );\r\n   Atomic.print ( \"Atomic.UISelectList selected string = \" + selectlist.getSelectedItemString());\r\n   Atomic.print ( \"or Atomic.UISelectList selected string = \" + selectlist.getItemString(selected));\r\n   }\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1541","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1541/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1541/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1541/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1541","id":229863467,"number":1541,"title":"[Scripting] Setting graphics subsystem mode doesn't work as expected - can't make window resizable","user":{"login":"Alan-FGR","id":8399299,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8399299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR","html_url":"https://github.com/Alan-FGR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-05-19T03:46:34Z","updated_at":"2017-05-19T03:47:15Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I couldn't find a way to make the window resizable after it's created, this call for example:\r\n    `GetSubsystem<Graphics>().SetMode(1280,720,false,false,true,false,false,true,0);`\r\nwhere I'm passing 'true' for the resizable parameter doesn't make it resizable.\r\nOn a related note, you may want to provide SetSize() and SetResizable() or setters to easily manipulate those values.
