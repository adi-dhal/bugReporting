investigation on why @toddgibson wasn't being able to switch scenes, I tried to achieve that and failed miserably; ended up discovering some problems:\r\n\r\nRef: https://files.gitter.im/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/tLTP/blob\r\n\r\nAs reported by @toddgibson, LoadScene() doesn't discard the current scene, but I'm not sure if that's the intended behavior. Since he wanted to effectively 'switch' scenes, I started looking for a way to manually remove the previous scene in a component.\r\n\r\nCadaver said somewhere that Scene.LoadXML should remove all previous data, but that also doesn't happen. I've also tried storing the previous scene and calling Clear(), Remove(), GetNode().Remove(), SetEnabled(false) and all of these simply crash the engine. Either when called before or after loading the next scene, cached or not.\r\n\r\nI thought that was because the Viewport wasn't switching scenes properly but even just a `GetSubsystem<Viewport>().SetScene(yourScene)` also crashes the engine.\r\n\r\nEven if you just disable the camera on your first scene and call LoadScene() to load another scene, the engine will also crash.\r\n\r\nConfirmed for loading scenes from C# component on Build 1. Need confirmation for other languages.\r\n\r\nReproduction steps: Create a new project in the editor, in the default scene disable the camera, create another scene and try to load it from a component in the first scene, compile and play. Optionally, re-enable the camera in the first scene, if you play now everything works, but the first scene can't be removed no matter what.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1245/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1244","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1244/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1244/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1244/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1244","id":193729683,"number":1244,"title":"[Graphics] Physically Based Rendering and More","user":{"login":"dragonCASTjosh","id":3044415,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3044415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragonCASTjosh","html_url":"https://github.com/dragonCASTjosh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragonCASTjosh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragonCASTjosh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragonCASTjosh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragonCASTjosh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragonCASTjosh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragonCASTjosh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragonCASTjosh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragonCASTjosh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragonCASTjosh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-12-06T10:02:17Z","updated_at":"2016-12-07T18:43:38Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"## Overview\r\nPBR is something I have been working on for some time and there are a few blocking features and ideas on what I'm going to implement.
