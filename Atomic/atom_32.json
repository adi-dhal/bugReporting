there are allot of level creation tools out there for Quake. Most of which are free, open source and/or are cross platform. All of them support the .map format.\n\nOpposed to writing a custom BSP/CSG tool for the atomic game engine why not create a importer for .map format levels for atomic game engine?\n\nWhat are the benefits?\n1. Level Designers and artists can create levels quickly with out a 3D modeling application and get them inside atomic quickly and easily.\n2. Time saved by using existing tools and battle tested technology used to ship games that is already open source.\n3. The format is well documented and can be easily implemented [link](http://www.gamers.org/dEngine/quake/QDP/qmapspec.html)\n4. We get a bunch of robust level editing toolsets for free that people are already familiar with.\n\n**So what should this \"Importer\" do?**\n1. Import level geometry / Brushes from the .map file\n2. Preserve UV Coordinates and texture placement within the map.\n3. Import the textures that are in use inside the .map file\n4. It should remove faces with \"no draw\" on them. (Optimization)\n\n**What should the \"Importer\" _NOT_ do?**\n1. Import game play specific entities (These can be defined in the atomic game editor)\n2. Import game play specific volumes (These can be defined in the atomic game editor)\n\nTo finish this feature request off I am posting an image of something that I am made with the Hammer Level Editor. I am a novice level designer an I made a some what good looking replica of the Lincoln Memorial as a test for this feature request. I have used hammer once or twice in the past and I am no pro with it. But this should show you how beneficial such tools can be.\n\n![Image](http://i.imgur.com/1Pqw88I.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/714/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/713","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/713/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/713/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/713/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/713","id":141988686,"number":713,"title":"[LINUX] Segmentation fault when running some of the sample projects","user":{"login":"guzzard","id":9007314,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/9007314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guzzard","html_url":"https://github.com/guzzard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guzzard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guzzard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guzzard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guzzard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guzzard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guzzard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guzzard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guzzard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guzzard/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-03-18T22:00:34Z","updated_at":"2016-08-24T20:00:08Z","closed_at":"2016-08-24T20:00:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Opening Basic2D and BunnyMark example projects works fine, but they crash on play with \"Segmentation fault (core dumped)\".
