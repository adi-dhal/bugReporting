needs to be some improvements to the TypeScript integration to make working with vscode a little easier\r\n* The ```allowNonTsExtensions``` setting is not compatible with the command line tsc, so need to either determine if this is no longer needed for the in-editor compiler, and don't emit this when generating an external ```tsconfig.json```\r\n* when generating the ```tsconfig.json```, don't specifically use the ```files``` block.  Instead, use the ```include``` block.  When consuming the ```tsconfig``` in the editor, ignore that block and re-generate the ```files``` block.  This will keep from needing to manually add files to the tsconfig in vscode.\r\n* possibly give the option to build out a tasks.json that will allow the TypeScript compilation step from vscode\r\n* relook at the ```typings``` folder.

PR introduces a command to AtomicTool that allows a directory of images to be compressed for later use by the engine (eg by adding it as a Resource directory)\r\n\r\nusage: AtomicTool compress \"Path/To/Directory\"\r\n\r\n@JoshEngebretson I'm in two minds on this. We definitely need it for external resource directories as I've mentioned before. However given that it also generates a cache directory (useful for the same reason), just calling it \"compress\" seems incorrect. It _could_ just be part of the project command, but it doesn't actually require a project to be loaded. It kind of feels like something we should just keep to our side, then we don't need to worry about issues like that. I PR'd it for your ease of comparison.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1212","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1212/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1212/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1212/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1212","id":191885621,"number":1212,"title":"[Wiki]
