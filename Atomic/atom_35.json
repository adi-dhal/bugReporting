PR is more of an experimental dive into trying to provide the ability to transpile TypeScript on save of a .ts file in the editor as well as playing with an editor extension type of architecture.  \n**TypeScriptLanguageService.ts**\nThis shows two ways of handling typescript. Either a simple single file transpile, which is very fast, but will only catch blatant syntax issues, or a full compile which loads all the TS files in the project and runs through full type checking etc.  This second option runs pretty slowly, and maybe either that can only be done on request, or during the build process.\n\n**Typescript.js**\nthis is a customized version of typescript.js that fixes a regex issue that duktape doesn't like.  The BuildCommon.js copies this file into the modules folder on build.\n\n**Extension Services**\nBasically what is happening is that there is ServiceLocator that extensions can register with.  When editor events occur, they notify the ServiceLocator that the event happened and the ServiceLocator delegates to anything registered for that event that can handle it.   Right now only the SaveResource method is hooked in, but this could be hooked into menu rendering, inspector creation, even filetype resource editors if it got robust enough.\n\nSome thoughts behind this were that you could have a Resources/EditorExtensions folder that could dynamically be queried by the editor to register new extensions.  In this example, the TypeScript resource extension is manually loaded in.  Also, it might be better to somehow hook into the normal event subscription model to notify these extensions of changes.\n\nAnyway, this is definitely a WIP and needs some discussion and iteration to make it better.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/614/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/613","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/613/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/613/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/613/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/613","id":127028102,"number":613,"title":"UI render to texture support","user":{"login":"Type1J","id":413028,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/413028?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Type1J","html_url":"https://github.com/Type1J","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Type1J/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Type1J/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Type1J/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Type1J/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Type1J/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Type1J/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Type1J/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Type1J/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Type1J/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":307350094,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/labels/difficulty:%203","name":"difficulty: 3","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":307350671,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"fbca04","default":false},{"id":170012522,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/labels/type:%20enhancement","name":"type: enhancement","color":"bfdadc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-01-16T14:20:24Z","updated_at":"2016-01-17T19:17:47Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"As per http://atomicgameengine.com/forum/#/discussion/182/atomic-development-thread\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/612","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/612/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/612/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/612/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/612","id":127016693,"number":612,"title":"Import assets option in menu with keyboard shortcut","user":{"login":"brunosxs","id":1557903,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1557903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunosxs","html_url":"https://github.com/brunosxs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunosxs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunosxs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunosxs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunosxs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunosxs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunosxs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunosxs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunosxs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brunosxs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-01-16T11:02:58Z","updated_at":"2016-01-16T16:11:26Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"There should have a proper option on the menu to import assets to add to the drag-and-drop approach, preferably top-level and with a standard shortcut like CTRL+I or something.\nSome kind of reimport/force reimport assets is also needed and could be put as a submenu of this new Import option.
