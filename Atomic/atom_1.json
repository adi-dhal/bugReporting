quick implementation in C# (extension):\r\n```C#\r\npublic static Vector2 ClampMagnitude(this Vector2 v, float maxMagnitude)\r\n    {\r\n        if (v.Length <= maxMagnitude)\r\n            return v;\r\n        return Vector2.Normalize(v) * maxMagnitude;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Vector Operations\r\nIt's somewhat confusing the fact that something like `MyVector3.Normalize()` is valid but won't work, and apparently the correct usage is `Vector3.Normalize(MyVector3)`... imho we should provide instance methods for these unary operations\r\n\r\n## Expose/port the entire Math API to Scripting\r\nWe don't have the API to raycast AABBs and some types are lacking too\r\n\r\n## Easy Eulerian angles rotation API\r\nProvide a way to rotate and set rotation that takes Eulerian angles, ~~and also a way to easily build a Quaternion from them~~\r\n\r\n## 2D Direction Setter\r\nbasically:\r\n```C#\r\npublic static void SetDirection2D(this Node n, Vector2 direction)\r\n{\r\n    n.Rotation2D = (float)(Math.Atan2(direction.X, -direction.Y) / Math.PI) * 180;\r\n}\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1638/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1637","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1637/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1637/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1637/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/1637","id":252834492,"number":1637,"title":"Optional

are 2 classes that enable the UISelectList to have multiple columns.  There is API to set the column type, column width, data for the column and fixing the column height, if necessary. Once set into the UISelectList, it operates the same way, to get which row is selected.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of column types that can be used\r\n  TEXT = which is a TextField, with left justified text, the column data is the text that will be displayed.\r\n  TEXTC = a TextField, with center justified text\r\n  TEXTR = a TextField with right justified text\r\n  IMAGE = an ImageWidget, the column data is the resource name (or pathname) to the file to display\r\n  COLOR = a ColorWidget, the column data is the hex color string, like \"#228800\", to display.\r\n  ICON = a SkinImage, the column data is the skin name for the icon to display.\r\n  \r\nIf the column height is left as 0, the content will determine the height of the row. If you need it to be a fixed size, the column height field can be used.\r\nThe columm widths must be programmed, and are needed to keep alignment for the widget, the content will not exceed the programmed value.\r\n\r\nExample Javascript code\r\n```\r\n    var mis = new Atomic.UIMultiItemSource();  // new itemsource\r\n\r\n    var columnHeight = 0;   // 0 = let content determine column height\r\n    var  = \"item1\";   // RefId string returned when list entry is selected\r\n\tvar aumi1 = new Atomic.UIMultiItem( columnRefId, \"ICON\", \"LogoAtomic\", 32, columnHeight );\r\n\taumi1.addColumn ( \"TEXT\", \"a new kind of list...\", 210 );\r\n\taumi1.addColumn ( \"TEXTC\", \"RW\",  20 );\r\n\taumi1.addColumn ( \"COLOR\", \"#33FF33\", 20 );\r\n\taumi1.addColumn ( \"TEXT\", \"moar\", 66 );\r\n\taumi1.addColumn ( \"TEXT\", \"moar text is fine, in multiple columns.\", 266 );\r\n    mis.addItem( aumi1 );\r\n    \r\n    mylist.setSource(mis);\r\n\r\n```\r\n![multilist](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19511757/29592631-3054227a-875a-11e7-8ba7-c4fcd1ba309c.png)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1629","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1629/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1629/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1629/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/1629","id":251965906,"number":1629,"title":"Merge with upstream","user":{"login":"rokups","id":19151258,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/19151258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups","html_url":"https://github.com/rokups","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rokups/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Alan-FGR","id":8399299,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8399299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR","html_url":"https://github.com/Alan-FGR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Alan-FGR","id":8399299,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8399299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR","html_url":"https://github.com/Alan-FGR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alan-FGR/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":14,"created_at":"2017-08-22T13:55:42Z","updated_at":"2017-08-25T11:55:22Z","closed_at":"2017-08-23T19:52:57Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pulls/1629","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/1629","diff_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/1629.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/1629.patch"},"body":"Merge with upstream.
