Before the urho changes, the events would fire off in order and the first one wouldn't fire off until everything in the scene loaded.  After the change, I'm noticing that events fire off before all the components have been loaded and I have been consistently hitting an issue where an event hits an infinite loop and keeps calling it's event handler even after it's already fired off (note, these are custom events, not built-in events such as update).

Events are orange, resource loading is blue\r\n* Profiler tool is using Qt5. On systems where Qt is not available cmake will display warning but engine will still build\r\n* C# support, requires projects to define `ATOMIC_PROFILING`.\r\n* Profiler is enabled automatically for debug builds\r\n* Command line parameters to set profiler port and enable/disable application listening for profiler connections\r\n\r\nIn the future easy_profiler maintainers plan support for dx11/12, opengl, vulkan and cuda profiling. Maintainers were very helpful and implemented non-scoped profiler blocks on my request. Tracking arbitrary values (my request as well) is already in the works, this will be useful for tracking c#/js object counts and what not.\r\n\r\nI found a way to do reasonably low-overhead c# code block profiling using lambda. There is still a chance to optimize a little by defining custom bindings to `Profiler::BeginBlock()` which takes `const char*` as parameter. It looks like this:\r\n```cs\r\nProfiler.Block(\"BlockName\", () => {\r\n    // Code here\r\n});\r\n```\r\nI did not add js support, however it is trivial. Is there a spot somewhere we could add some extra code for typescript to use much like `Script/AtomicNET/AtomicNET/Core/Profiler.cs`? In js it would look like so:\r\n```js\r\nProfiler.block(\"BlockName\", function() {\r\n    // Code here\r\n});\r\n```\r\nCan we set `engineParameters_` from c#/js applications? If we can - how? We need this in order to make listening for profiler connections opt-in instead of opt-out.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [x] js support\r\n- [x] Add `ATOMIC_PROFILING` to debug configurations of C# projects\r\n- [x] Make profiler not listen by default\r\n- [x] Add manual optimized bindings for `Profiler::BeginBlock()`\r\n\r\nPlease

Adds ```bool AtomicNET.IsMainThread();``` for telling if currently on main engine thread\r\n+ Adds ```AtomicNET.RunGC();``` method which runs a system GC cycle, waits for finalizers, and disposes of native instances\r\n+ Adds support for throwing managed exceptions from native code\r\n+ Improves managed RefCounted caching with support for strong and weak references\r\n+ Managed RefCounted now implements the IDisposable interface, SafeHandles are used to avoid needing cleanup code in C# finalizers themselves (finalizers unfortunately look like C++ destructors, though are not, and can be run in any thread)\r\n+ Adds support for C# native bindings to specify managed interfaces for classes (for example, IDisposable)\r\n+ Fix for PhysicsRayCast result when RigidBody is null\r\n+ Scenes are automatically Disposed when unloaded from Player submodule\r\n+ Fix for RenderSurface when parent texture has been deleted\r\n+ Optimizations to Metrics profiler also JS/C# components will use their component type name, so can track specific components\r\n+ Added support for printing active node names through Metrics, helps track down node leaks\r\n+ Metrics must now be enabled with ```Metrics.Enable();```, this avoids inadvertently enabling them, which impacts performance\r\n+ Added method for printing loaded resources to ResourceCache\r\n+ Fixed issue with binding generation when source root or package folder didn't end with a trailing slash\r\n+ Optimization for Vector return values from generated binding code, lazy init upon method call instead of at Object instantiation\r\n+ Updated C# FeatureExamples to dispose of scenes and resources when cycling
