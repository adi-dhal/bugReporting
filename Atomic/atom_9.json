PR adds new JS object literals to the Atomic namespace that allows for more proper enums instead of having to use constants.  Now, in both TS and JS, instead of using:\r\n```\r\nAtomic.BT_STATIC\r\n```\r\n\r\nyou can use\r\n```\r\nAtomic.BodyType2D.BT_STATIC\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe original constants are still present in the Atomic namespace so existing code doesn't break, but it is flagged to be removed.  I also left the existing constants in the ```d.ts```, but am contemplating removing it.  The repercussions would be that existing TS that uses the constants would have transpilation errors and would have to be converted to use the enums, but the JS would work fine.  Also, it would clean up the auto-generated documentations and not have all those extra constants.  Thoughts?\r\n\r\nEach of the existing legacy constants has a comment stating that it is deprecated and points to the corresponding enum.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1389/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1388","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1388/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1388/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1388/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/1388","id":201450551,"number":1388,"title":"Adding
