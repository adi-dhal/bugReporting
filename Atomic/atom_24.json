#700 and #356 \n\nThis PR provides the following enhancements to the UIEditField\n- If you tab into it from another field, the contents get auto selected so you can quickly type a new value\n- If you click-select the field, the contents get auto selected so you can quickly type a new value\n- If a field is already focused and auto selected and you click into it again, the auto-selection will disappear and the caret will appear where you clicked\n\nSome issues I ran across:\nIt appears that the `OnFocusedChange` event in the UIEditField does not get called when the widget is getting created and when the `autofocus:1` value is specified in the `tb.txt` field.  The `OnFocusedChange` event **is** getting fired by the underlying TB widget, but may be getting triggered too early and the UIEditField doesn't capture it.  \n\nTo get around this, I made a modification to the new project dialog to remove the `autofocus` tag and programmatically set focus to the field in the code on creation.  This behaves as expected.  Let me know if this is an acceptable solution and I can look at other places where the auto-focus is being used or if there needs to be some low level research into why that event isn't getting bubbled up.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/955/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/954","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/954/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/954/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/954/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/954","id":170722102,"number":954,"title":"Haptic

be able to keep our code in separate libraries, we're working in a custom .sln, with the Atomic-generated AtomicProject.csproj added to it. Working like this we've run into the following:\n\nAdding a .cs file to the project from the AtomicEditor opens the AtomicProject.sln without updating the .csproj first. This means having to go back to the editor and manually regenerate the project first. \n- [x] Project should first regenerate when a file is added, before opening the solution\n- [x] Ideally, only the .csproj should be regenerated, not the .sln, allowing devs to add projects to the solution which would be opened by the editor\n\nAdding new files to the project in VS adds them to the AtomicNET directory tree, instead of to Resources. Combined with the above workflow issues adding through the editor this makes adding new files awkward.\n- [ ] If the .csproj was kept in the atomic project root, files could rather be generated in /Resources/Scripts, with binaries still being generated to /Resources/AtomicNET if necessary\n\nWhen generating the .csproj, source files are added using absolute, instead of relative paths. While this is not an issue if the .csproj is regenerated by every developer on the project, the need to do that means losing references added to the project.\n- [x] Files should be added using relative paths.\n\nWhen regenerating the .csproj, both dependencies and NuGet settings are lost. This means every time the AtomicProject.csproj is regenerated (whenever a file is added), all dependencies must be re-added.\n- [x] Automatically adding all .dlls under /Resources or /Resources/Plugins to the AtomicProject.csproj's  dependencies when regenerating would be one way to solve the dependencies problem.\n- [ ] I'm not sure if there's a way to regenerate a .csproj while preserving some aspects :/ We use a <name>.vcxproj.user in other solutions. This can be copied into the same directory as the <name>.vcproj and its content will be added to project settings when loading, adding the auto-generated aspects to this file instead of the .vcproj might be a solution.\n- [ ] A minor one, but naming the .csproj and .dll according to the project itself would be nice, as well as setting the .csproj's default namespace to the name of the project.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/952/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/951","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/951/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/951/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/951/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/951","id":170524973,"number":951,"title":"Color
