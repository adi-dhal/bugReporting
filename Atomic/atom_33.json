uses around 1.2Gk memory (I don't get lags while moving in the level). When I close the window that is playing the game this process end and the first Atomic process stay at 36k memory\n\nIf I open a map/scene, the first process rise to 1.2Gk since it load the map, but when I close the map the process does not go back to 36k memory it stays at 1.2Gk. When I play the game (with the map/scene close in the background) I have both Atomic process at 1.2 Gk memory which makes the game lag a lot, even so I still have 8Gm of free Ram.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/670/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/669","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/669/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/669/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/669/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/669","id":135482019,"number":669,"title":"Enable Chrome dev tools for WebView","user":{"login":"JoshEngebretson","id":376203,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/376203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshEngebretson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-02-22T17:19:04Z","updated_at":"2016-02-22T17:19:04Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Chromium comes with tooling for inspecting pages and debugging, look into enabling the tooling with the Atomic WebView (a top level window would be good, though will require API additions)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/669/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/668","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/668/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/668/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/668/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/668","id":135468575,"number":668,"title":"Investigate TypeScript API doc generation with TypeDoc","user":{"login":"JoshEngebretson","id":376203,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/376203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshEngebretson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-02-22T16:32:04Z","updated_at":"2016-05-10T04:26:27Z","closed_at":"2016-05-10T04:26:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Once initial TS API doc generation is hooked up, can integrate with build so available in Atomic Editor binary distro.
