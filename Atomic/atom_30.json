PR migrates some of the events that were on the native side into the typescript side.  Namely ProjectUnloaded and DeleteResource.  Unfortunately, the HandleWebMessage event can't be migrated yet because there is no way for the Typescript to handle the E_WEBVIEWMESSAGE.HANDLER->Success() message, so the engine throws an error that the message has been unhandled.\n\nThis also refactors the way editors are instantiated by having an Editor Builder service that editor builders can register with.  The ResourceFrame then passes a path to this service and is returned a builder for that type of editor.  Each builder is also in charge of hooking in and responding to the appropriate events for that editor.  This could probably be expanded in the future to allow user provided editors and also migrate more out of the ResourceFrame.ts, but it's a start.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/780","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/780/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/780/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/780/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/780","id":153184415,"number":780,"title":"[Prefabs 2.0] Changes to objects based on prefabs are lost when saving/loading a scene","user":{"login":"mattbenic","id":278871,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/278871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic","html_url":"https://github.com/mattbenic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":307349922,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/labels/difficulty:%205","name":"difficulty: 5","color":"f7c6c7","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/milestones/5/labels","id":2242346,"number":5,"title":"Issue Staging","description":"A staging area for milestones, while we work through the backlog","creator":{"login":"JoshEngebretson","id":376203,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/376203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshEngebretson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":70,"closed_issues":3,"state":"open","created_at":"2017-01-11T00:50:23Z","updated_at":"2017-07-07T18:59:07Z","due_on":"2017-12-31T08:00:00Z","closed_at":null},"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-05-05T07:42:46Z","updated_at":"2017-01-12T23:03:09Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Repro:\n*Create an empty scene\n*Create a simple object with a StaticModel component\n*Make a prefab of that object\n*Drag a prefab version into a scene\n*Change a simple value like LOD Bias on both the original and prefab copy objects, do NOT apply changes back to the prefab\n*Save the scene\n*Close and reopen the scene.

These preferences are also propagated to the web client so that editor extensions can retrieve the settings.  Additionally, whenever preferences are changed from the host, a preference change event is sent to the web client so the web client can respond appropriately.\n\nThe other changes here are some lint whitespace changes and also refactoring of the webview client extension names and structure to more closely match the changes made the host extension naming done in a previous PR.\n\nI did have a question on the user preference file.  I'm using: \n\n```\nToolCore.toolSystem.project.userPrefsFullPath \n```\n\nto store the preferences in and this points to a file called `projectname.userpreferences`.  It appears that the Snap Settings dialog stores settings in a different file called `UserPrefs.json` .  Should't those also be stored in the `projectname.userpreferences` file?  \n\nI updated the routine that saves the Snap Settings to not overwrite the file, but to retain any extraneous settings that may also be in there and just update with the known settings, so switching over to the `projectname.userpreferences` file should be seamless if that's the way you would like to go.  Either that or have `ToolCore.toolsSystem.project.userPrefsFullPath` point to the `UserPrefs.json` file.\n\nI'm going to be using this to coordinate some settings in the TypeScript extension, but thought I would break out just the user settings piece into it's own PR so it's easier to digest.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/778/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/777","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/777/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/777/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/777/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/777","id":151915616,"number":777,"title":"Automatically generate getter/setter for script bindings which throws for read/write only member properties","user":{"login":"JoshEngebretson","id":376203,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/376203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshEngebretson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-04-29T16:40:06Z","updated_at":"2016-04-29T16:40:06Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please see https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/772#issuecomment-215409668 for some discussion\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/777/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/776","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/776/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/776/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/776/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/776","id":151851473,"number":776,"title":"Turbo badger editor settings","user":{"login":"shaddockh","id":2951562,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2951562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh","html_url":"https://github.com/shaddockh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-04-29T12:07:24Z","updated_at":"2016-04-29T16:48:43Z","closed_at":"2016-04-29T16:45:58Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pulls/776","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/776","diff_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/776.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/776.patch"},"body":"added new language handler for turbobadger files in the webview editor.

I do expose opacity here, but not color, which would be useful. It seems that text color might be exposed, but not a filtered (diffuse-style) color that affects the whole widget as opacity does.\n\nHere's my test file, just so you can see how these might be used:\n\n```\n'atomic component';\n\nrequire(\"GSAP\");\n\nvar particleEmitter;\nvar buttons = [];\n\nfunction createButton(self, peffectName) {\n    var button = new Atomic.UIButton();\n    button.fontId = \"Vera\";\n    button.fontSize = 30;\n    button.text = peffectName;\n    button.gravity = Atomic.UI_GRAVITY_RIGHT;\n    button.layoutWidth = 350;\n    button.layoutHeight = 50;\n    button.opacity = 0.50;\n    button.tl = new TimelineLite();\n    button.tl.to(button, 0.25, {fontSize: 40, layoutWidth: 370, opacity: 1.0});\n    button.tl.stop();\n    buttons.push(button);\n    button.onClick = function() {\n        particleEmitter.effect = Atomic.cache.getResource(\"ParticleEffect\", \"Particles/\" + peffectName + \".peffect\");\n        buttons.forEach(function(button) {\n            button.tl.reverse();\n        });\n        button.tl.play();\n    }\n    var current = particleEmitter.effect.name.match(/^Particles\\/(.*)\\.peffect$/)[1];\n    if (peffectName === current) {\n        button.tl.progress(1.0);\n    }\n    return button;\n}\n\n//UI component\nexports.component = function(self) {\n    var UI = Atomic.getUI();\n\n    particleEmitter = self.getComponent(\"ParticleEmitter\");\n\n    self.uiView = new Atomic.UIView();\n\n    var layout = new Atomic.UILayout();\n    layout.rect = self.uiView.rect;\n    layout.axis = Atomic.UI_AXIS_Y;\n    layout.layoutPosition = Atomic.UI_LAYOUT_POSITION_GRAVITY;\n    self.uiView.addChild(layout);\n\n    layout.addChild(createButton(self, \"Disco\"));\n    layout.addChild(createButton(self, \"Fire\"));\n    layout.addChild(createButton(self, \"Smoke\"));\n    layout.addChild(createButton(self, \"SmokeStack\"));\n    layout.addChild(createButton(self, \"SnowExplosion\"));\n};\n```\n\nIt's based on the ParticleEmitter3D example. I'm not doing anything special with the particles; I'm only tweening the button properties. Each button is given a timeline, and it tweens the font size, width (layout based width, since it's in a layout), and opacity when it's selected, so unselected buttons are translucent, have a smaller font size, and a smaller width, while the selected button is fully opaque, has a slightly larger font size, and a slightly larger width. Those 3 properties are tweened on a button press.\n\nHere's a (unfortunately unanimated)

One main culprit of this is to be able to bring in the latest *.d.ts files on each new update.  I'm thinking that this could be delegated to the extension subsystem.  What I'm thinking is that the editor can execute a method on the extension ServiceLocator:\n\n```\nServiceLocator.upgradeHandler.isUpgradeAvailable({editor version});\n```\n\nIf any extensions subscribed to this event return `true` then either an upgrade menu item appears or a dialog box pops up stating : \"Project Upgrades Available.  Do you want to apply them?\"\n\nIf the answer is yes, then the editor calls\n\n```\nServiceLocator.upgradeHandler.applyUpgrades\n```\n\nAnd then it is up to each extension to upgrade the relevant files as necessary.  For instance the TypeScript extension could have the latest _.d.ts files somewhere and it could overwrite the files in ```ProjectRoot/typings/Atomic/_```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/757/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/756","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/756/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/756/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/756/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/756","id":148224790,"number":756,"title":"Refactoring the extension interface names to make more sense","user":{"login":"shaddockh","id":2951562,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2951562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh","html_url":"https://github.com/shaddockh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaddockh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-04-14T01:22:43Z","updated_at":"2016-04-14T13:47:59Z","closed_at":"2016-04-14T13:47:55Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pulls/756","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/756","diff_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/756.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/756.patch"},"body":"This PR attempts to make the extension interfaces make more sense.
