1901271 Expose mouse position manipulation api in Input class\n- d4039d5 Add functions for mipmap manipulation to Image.\n- 90efa3b Specify high precision for water shader varyings on GLES to fix shaky reflection/refraction texture sampling. Closes #1593.\n- 5b67d28 Let Box2D world stay at default values for continuous (true) & substepping (false), since substepping enabled leads to erratic behavior under load. Closes #1592.\n- 97eba58 Fix implicit conversion in normal offset shadow calculations. Closes #1586.\n- 9c6e607 Fix memory leak in Dictionary.\n- 00f0a87 Stop existing weight fade when AnimationController::SetWeight() is called, to ensure the set weight is not overridden one frame later. Closes #1583.\n- 7c72c36 Fix LookAt Mixed rotation mode.\n- b227682 Possibility to enable alpha-to-coverage in either pass or material (all passes). Requires D3D11 or OpenGL and hardware multisampling enabled. Seems to look slightly different on D3D / OpenGL. Fixed depth bias not being copied in Material::Clone(). Closes #1578.\n- 90d7d22 Do not make a value copy of the VariantVector inside the attribute in SceneResolver. Closes #1576.\n- 32ef767 Make a value copy of the node IDs when resolving. Potential solution for #1576.\n- 9114141 Add missing enum string name for serialization.\n- 83acf5b Optional per-texture specifiable max. anisotropy level. Closes #1563.\n- 6323aed Add NavigationPushiness::NAVIGATIONPUSHINESS_NONE\n- 5f7ef27 fix skydome glsl error\n- 19300a3 Add note that ResetTarget() doesn't stop automatically. Do not debug draw a \"velocity\" target for CrowdAgent. Closes #1572.\n- 6895a51 Pass-level mechanism for eliminating unnecessary shader compilation defines. Closes #1567. Use this mechanism to eliminate PACKEDNORMAL define from depth & shadow pass in normalmapped techniques.\n- 4e5f83a Make it safe to remove CrowdAgent during the reposition event. Closes #1570.\n- 6be0d71 Fix keeping track of RigidBody2D constraints. Closes #1569.\n- 02fae13 Update face camera mode name and add script bindings.\n- d344cae Add new face camera mode to BillboardSet and Text3D.\n- 2b2f12f Added porting note related to light max extrusion parameter.\n- 2fe4cb0 Add max extrusion parameter for directional lights. Default to 1000. This prevents large far clip causing poor shadow map depth resolution and too strong effect of depth bias parameters, but can be increased if very tall shadows are needed.\n- 623639c Add note of example use of render order.\n- 695f750 Remove specific AlphaMask & NormalPacked techniques, in favor of adding the necessary shader defines in the material instead.\n- dc90a2d Remove ambiguous weak ptr constructor call.\n- 48f779e Add possibility for materials to define vertex & pixel shader compilation defines, like techniques & passes. Related to #1566. As a consequence, removed the \"alphamask\" hint from techniques (render order can be used instead) and automatic determination if material should occlude. Fixed bugs in Material JSON save. Allow JSONValue::Size() to also work in object mode. Added porting notes as necessary.\n- 3dfb4a4 Find navigation mesh from the scene in a delayed manner. Plus other codepath consistency fixes for CrowdManager. Closes #1565.\n- 1dbb990 Convert double to float when assigning a shader parameter (possible danger when setting material parameters from Lua)\n- 0201718 Add missing assert to PODVector.\n- 2d59e72 Guard against self-assignment clearing the containers.\n- 7a600be Refactor Vector and PODVector implementation.\n- 000b1af Check for obstacle node moving and update navigation mesh appropriately. Needs a hack to skip this during scene deletion to avoid crash. Closes #1558.\n- b7c7568 Add to/from string conversions for JSONValueType & JSONNumberType. Minor code cleanup and missing JSONValue script bindings. Closes #1546.\n- ab40958 Detect Push / Insert to Vector or PODVector from inside itself and make a value copy in that case. Closes #1556.\n- 8bef941 Fix slowed down navigation crowd agent when node dirtied in E_CROWD_AGENT_NODE_REPOSITION. Send the event only after position has been updated. Check for only rotation changing when node dirtied, and do not update position / reset state in that case. Closes #1548.\n- d72de15 Add note that GetNextLevel() will keep returning 1x1x1 image if necessary. Closes #1554.\n- 5b70c5d Restore earlier method of defining camera frustum when a custom projection matrix is not in use, to improve deferred depth reconstruction accuracy. Related to #1551.\n- b3964e2 Demonstrate Z fighting elimination by depth bias in 10_RenderToTexture sample. Closes #1543.\n- 79f1a1b added a check for invalid boneIndex caused by geometry key animation\n- a1aa049 fixed geometry having animation key problem\n- 489f759 Fix slope-scale depth bias potentially not creating new rasterizer state on D3D11 due to poor hashing. Remove mistaken adjustment of slope-scale bias on OpenGL. Now behavior should be uniform between D3D9/D3D11/OpenGL. Closes #1547.\n- 9d5380b Remove extraneous f from GLSL code to satisfy the compiler.\n- 6a72b70 Fix copypaste error in attribute accessor.\n- 273a3ac Add support of free functions as attribute accessors.\n- 6c4a112 Add note on camera projection matrix API change.\n- d9c0ce7 Send also node-specific 2D collision events. Closes #1535.\n- 341f2d9 Normalize slash / backslash when AnimationController queries for existence of an animation state. Closes #1537.\n- bc8074a Added SetProjection() to camera, which sets custom projection matrix. This is reset by modifying any of the standard projection parameters (farClip, FOV etc.) Make sure camera's actual far & near clip are based on the projection matrix.\n- 871e52f Base frustum calculation on the projection matrix.\n- 3af3c2b fixed channelIndices[] indexing in ExpandAnimatedChannelKeys() func.\n- 48cd15b Store camera projection matrix as API-independent and convert as necessary (preparation for allowing the user to define a custom projection matrix.) Camera GetProjection() API changed; GetGPUProjection() is now used to get the API-specific projection for use as a shader parameter.\n- bef8df2 Support defining neighbor terrains to avoid LOD level discontinuities at the edges.\n- d3cc011 Handle flipping of normals in collision event sending if body pointers were swapped. Do not discard contact results from the \"other\" manifold, rather concatenate them into the same collision event. Thanks to Enhex for highlighting the issue.\n  ecfa732 Workaround GCC issue producing shared lib containing undefined symbol. Close #1519.\n- 9bbec4b Explain why normal offset is not saved for materials. Closes #1518.\n- 7b5da66 Skip adding a deferred light volume batch when the light has low 8 bits of lightmask cleared; it would not have effect due to the stencil test. Skip shadow map render when there are no forward & deferred batches using it.\n- 2c8ed38 Capitalize CrowdAgent enum attributes for consistency with other components. Loading is case-insensitive so this does not break existing scenes.\n- 3fe5024 Remove deprecated autoRemove bool from SoundSource. Replace with a more generic AutoRemoveMode enum which is now used by both SoundSource & ParticleEmitter.\n- a2d86f1 Get screenshot as RGBA on OpenGL ES to fix Android black screenshot.\n- a76fc0a Undefine GetObject in TileMapLayer2D.h to prevent it getting confused with Win32 API function define. To help, the header should be included after Windows.h is included. Related to #1512.\n- 0991c8e Ensure node's components are properly marked for network update in case node is late added to the scene. Make it impossible for a NetworkState to exist without properly allocated currentValues & previousValues. Fix erroneous comment in C++ version of SceneReplication sample. Code cleanup & minor optimization. Closes #1511.\n- 2f25c3b Add note to discourage use of AddComponent(). Prevent attempting to assign model resource on StaticModel / AnimatedModel when no node set.
