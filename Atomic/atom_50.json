rather than post everything in gitter for suggestions and not put it in my own list of wishes - this is better. these are just my own thoughts about what i would like to see. im not begging for these, these are just my views on what would be cool for atomic.\nthese are either cosmetic or actual features of use\ni am using the repo version also, if you are wondering ;)\n\n• after running a project. a window pops up saying what has happened. this should go into console instead.\n• key layouts other than QWERTY need to be addressed. such as the camera/scene movement. you can move the camera with WASD, but for others without a QWERTY layout, this is problematic. arrow keys instead?\n• to be able to minimive/maximize views, such as the sidebars and move things to your liking\n• saves your layout\n• to be able to make text in the editor bigger/smaller\n• move the top bar 'play' options away and put them either next to the actual top bar, next to file-edit etc. or above the 'project' name on the top left, or put it to the top right above 'inspector'. this leaves room for the tabs to move up and take that space, giving more for scene view\n• take away the cartoony tick boxes in the inspector. they are out of sync with atomic. i would go for a blue/color box that lights when on, grey when off. a bit like the dropdown markers in inspector\n• also the cartoony 'x' for closing files are out of place. plus are a little hard to see. \n\ni had some more. but really thats good for now.\nill add as and when i think of them. but something just thats on my mind when i first use atomic\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/158","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/158/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/158/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/158/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/158","id":100074912,"number":158,"title":"slow
