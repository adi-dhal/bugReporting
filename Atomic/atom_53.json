It would be very helpful to have support for dynamically included libraries.\n\nFrom the current engine source, it appears the appropriate way to do this would be to modify JSVM::js_module_search to load .dll (/.so/whatever per deployment platform) libraries and register their exposed methods to the duk_context. \n\nSome challenges here:\n*While there is extensive discussion of a simple \"standard\" dynamic library loader for duktape [here](https://github.com/svaarala/duktape/issues/52) it doesn't seem to be available yet. Would likely need to be implemented from scratch.\n*library loading and exposing would need implementation per platform\n*would not be able to support this in iOS, perhaps a different approach would be in order-maybe introducing a requirement for static lib versions that could then be linked against when building the player?\n*Current editor distribution does not include any headers for such libraries to include. Could the build process be modified to include headers for such plugin libraries to be able to make use of Atomic objects\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/77/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/76","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/76/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/76/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/76/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/76","id":72656969,"number":76,"title":"Expose Log subsystem to JS as other subsystems","user":{"login":"JoshEngebretson","id":376203,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/376203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshEngebretson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshEngebretson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-05-02T14:55:52Z","updated_at":"2016-11-14T19:16:25Z","closed_at":"2016-11-14T19:16:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The Log subsystem is not currently exposed to JS as Input, etc.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/76/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/75","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/75/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/75/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/75/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/75","id":72474239,"number":75,"title":"AtomicEditor high CPU usage on Linux","user":{"login":"CTrauma","id":943437,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/943437?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTrauma","html_url":"https://github.com/CTrauma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTrauma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTrauma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTrauma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTrauma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTrauma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTrauma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTrauma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTrauma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CTrauma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-05-01T17:00:28Z","updated_at":"2015-07-27T01:44:25Z","closed_at":"2015-07-27T01:44:25Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"When I start the Editor on linux ( Linux 3.19.0-15-lowlatency #15-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT Fri Apr 17 00:03:20 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux ) it looks like it uses of 50 % of both my cores with no project loaded.
