This doesn't have the Emscripten part, yet.\n\nI have to apologize:\n\nI realized that the WebSocket that I've been using and testing for a while now is not actually compatible with what I sent to you the first time. I cleaned up the code, and made this pull request to fix those incompatibilities.\n\nBasically, this version does a lot less copying of messages. I'd like to get it to no copies, but it still might copy here or there. One main difference is that it doesn't copy a message into JavaScript space until it's requested. (An ID int could be at the beginning of a message, and the JS code could choose not to read it, which prevents an unnecessary copy. This is done be making the message a Deserializer instead of a String or PODVector (Yes, JavaScript PODVector<unsigned char> support is on it's way from me as well, but not in this pull.). Specifically, it uses a BufferQueue instance, even though messages would probably only ever be 1 buffer. I made the BufferQueue class for a better HTTP interface, not really for WebSockets, but because I had to bind it in JSIO, I wanted to keep the number of mixins necessary down for simplicity.\n\nI promise to never make another incompatible change unless it's really necessary. Just to be clear, the only breaking change is with the WebSocket \"message\" event handler. Instead of \"data\" with a String object, you get \"message\", which is a Deserializer, and from that you can read a String or a Uint8Array, if you want the binary version. It's not present in JS memory until it's read from the Deserializer.\n\nA corresponding AtomicExamples change is on it's way as well. It's only a 1 line change from:\n\n```\nconsole.log(\"WebSocket Message: \" + event.data);\n```\n\nto:\n\n```\nconsole.log(\"WebSocket Message: \" + event.message.readString());\n```\n\nAgain, I'm sorry for not sending this change sooner, since it does require existing code to make a similar change in their \"message\" event handlers, but I know how the Atomic Game Engine works much better now, and I feel pretty strongly that this is a good change.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/450/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/449","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/449/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/449/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/449/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/449","id":117309242,"number":449,"title":"FileSystem.ScanDir only filters by extension","user":{"login":"mattbenic","id":278871,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/278871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic","html_url":"https://github.com/mattbenic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbenic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":307350094,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/labels/difficulty:%203","name":"difficulty: 3","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":307350829,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/labels/priority:%20low","name":"priority: low","color":"0052cc","default":false},{"id":307353247,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/labels/type:%20feature","name":"type: feature","color":"bfdadc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-11-17T08:47:05Z","updated_at":"2016-01-07T00:36:02Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"On Windows, FileSystem.ScanDir does not supoort arbitrary file filters, it only looks for files with a matching extension to the provided filter.
