This just includes the minimal amount of code required to use the recently released version of the VSCode Duktape debugger from: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HaroldBrenes.duk-debug\r\n\r\nI have been working on a PR for that extension to ensure that it works with the way we are utilizing the duktape 1.5 require system and those changes have just been pulled in and he also released a version that works with Duktape 2.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, you can now kick off the player and attach to it from vscode.  The extension also properly handles sourcemaps.\r\n\r\n- Point vscode to your project root\r\n- Install the VSCode duktape debugger extension in vscode\r\n- Then set up a task in vscode: **tasks.json** (You will need to point command to your editor location)\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\r\n    \"tasks\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"taskName\": \"Run Player\",\r\n            \"command\": \"${env.HOME}/Development/Atomic/AtomicMaster/AtomicGameEngine/Artifacts/AtomicEditor/AtomicEditor.app/Contents/MacOS/AtomicEditor\",\r\n            \"args\": [\r\n                \"--player\",\r\n                \"--debug\",\r\n                \"--project\",\r\n                \"${workspaceRoot}\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"isBackground\": true\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen set up a debugger configuration:\r\n**launch.json**\r\nnote: set sourceMaps to true if using TS and make sure you turn on sourcemaps in the tsconfig\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\r\n    \"configurations\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"name\": \"Attach\",\r\n            \"type\": \"duk\",\r\n            \"request\": \"attach\",\r\n            \"address\": \"localhost\",\r\n            \"port\": 9091,\r\n            \"localRoot\": \"${workspaceRoot}/Resources\",\r\n            \"sourceMaps\": true,\r\n            \"outDir\": \"${workspaceRoot}/Resources\",\r\n            \"stopOnEntry\": false,\r\n            \"debugLog\": true\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Launch the editor task ( ctrl/cmd+shift+p > Tasks: Run Task) then select the \"Run Player\" task\r\n- go to debug in vscode and attach (the player will be paused waiting until you attach)\r\n- now you can pause, set breakpoints, view variables, etc.\r\n\r\n@JoshEngebretson \r\nThe idea behind this is to get this functionality out there while work continues on trying to embed a debugging interface into the editor itself.  The functionality in the editor may not be as advanced, but will be available w/o any third party software needed.  The question I have at this point is would having the debugger built into the Atomic Editor even be necessary anymore?  We could follow the lead of how the C# debugging story is working and just require a 3rd party piece.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Configure duktape 2.x to enable debugging\r\n- Migrate debug socket hooks from @JimMarlowe in IPCPlayerApp.cpp/h\r\n- Updates to jsrequire to set the module filename correctly\r\n- cleanup\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1489","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1489/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1489/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/issues/1489/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/pull/1489","id":215571521,"number":1489,"title":"Adding
