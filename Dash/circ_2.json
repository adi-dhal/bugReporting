If it is to be loaded, and not created when added to an object, it should specify a loader as a template parameter like this: `@yamlComponent!(q{name => Assets.get!Mesh( name )})()`. If no loader is specified, then the object is to be created. For an example of yaml component with a getter, see [Mesh](https://github.com/Circular-Studios/Dash/blob/feature/ObjectRefresh/source/components/mesh.d#L60-L61), and for one that is created, see [RotateThing in Sample-Game](https://github.com/Circular-Studios/Sample-Dash-Game/blob/feature/ObjectRefresh/Scripts/testobject.d#L39-L40).\n- Each Yaml-able field should have an `@field` attribute on it. Loaders can also be specified on fields as well using the same syntax. The YAML tag can be overridden on either using a non-template function parameter (ex: `@field( \"Field\" )` ).\n- Behaviors are no more. Scripts should now override `Component` and `YamlComponent`.\n\nRequires
