Things must be changing. Here's the big bad list of what happened:\n1. All imports of `gl3n` were moved to `dash.utility.math`. This is so that in the future, the transition to `gfm:math` is as smooth as possible. There are also aliases to more desirable type names, so that we can get away from using `vec3` and the like.\n2. Assets: The asset system has been better defined. All actual assets only extend `Asset` (not `Component`), and some assets reference types that extend `AssetRef(T)`. This is so that the code is cleaner in general, and for serialization purposes, so that we're not serializing entire textures/meshes.\n3. Serialization/Components: There should no longer be anyone accessing Yaml nodes directly. The new standard is to deserialize directly into a `struct`/`class`, and access from there. `GameObject` and `Component` have both been rewritten to live by this rule, and the resulting code is much simpler. No more ensuring yaml nodes are maps, no more doing `tryFind`s, just straight accessing of a description.\n\nFeedback welcome! While there are a butt load of changes in this PR, most of them are the `vec3`->`vec3f` swap, so it's not as scary as it looks.\n\nDestroy!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Circular-Studios/Dash/issues/224/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Circular-Studios/Dash/issues/223","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Circular-Studios/Dash","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Circular-Studios/Dash/issues/223/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Circular-Studios/Dash/issues/223/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Circular-Studios/Dash/issues/223/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Circular-Studios/Dash/pull/223","id":43674904,"number":223,"title":"Feature: Audio","user":{"login":"ScrappyOrc","id":1704122,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1704122?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrappyOrc","html_url":"https://github.com/ScrappyOrc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrappyOrc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrappyOrc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrappyOrc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrappyOrc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrappyOrc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrappyOrc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrappyOrc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrappyOrc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrappyOrc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-09-23T19:50:05Z","updated_at":"2014-09-25T17:21:48Z","closed_at":"2014-09-25T02:47:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Circular-Studios/Dash/pulls/223","html_url":"https://github.com/Circular-Studios/Dash/pull/223","diff_url":"https://github.com/Circular-Studios/Dash/pull/223.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Circular-Studios/Dash/pull/223.patch"},"body":"I implemented Audio!
