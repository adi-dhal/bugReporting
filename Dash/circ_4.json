Maybe make a GameObject.disable(), and then it will not draw if it has a mesh, not light things if it contains a light, etc?  Feel free to suggest.\n\nCurrent Use Case:  There are pipes on the walls in a current project.  Because of that, when viewing from outside, we'd like to clip the walls.  The flat surface of the wall is clipped by backface culling, but since the pipes are round, you see them through the walls.
