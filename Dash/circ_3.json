moves game object logic out of `GameObjects` children, and into children of `Behavior`. This does a number of things for us:\n- `GameObject.createFromYaml` becomes much much simpler.\n- An object can have multiple `Behavior`s on it.\n- A `Behavior` can be added to an object after it is initialized.\n- Scripts that don't take `onInitialize` arguments can now actually have an `onInitialize` method that is called after all yaml loading is complete.\n- Decoupling scripts and objects paves the way for a polymorphic scripting system.\n\nDown sides:\n- This is very much a code breaking change.

All content can now be consolidated to a single `Content.yml` file. This is good for preparing for releases, as well as small games with little content.\n2. The single YAML file can be embedded in the executable. This is done by adding `\"versions\": [ \"ImportContent\"]` to the `dub.json` file, and making sure to set `stringImportPaths` to the location of `Content.yml`. The advantage of this is that it means only art assets (textures and meshes) need to be distributed along side the game. This means that modding will become very difficult (unless purposefully left easy).\n\nSee the [`feature/SingleYamlDocument`](https://github.com/Circular-Studios/Sample-Dash-Game/compare/feature;SingleYamlDocument) branch in sample game for more info.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Circular-Studios/Dash/issues/159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Circular-Studios/Dash/issues/158","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Circular-Studios/Dash","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Circular-Studios/Dash/issues/158/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Circular-Studios/Dash/issues/158/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Circular-Studios/Dash/issues/158/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Circular-Studios/Dash/issues/158","id":31923826,"number":158,"title":"[Input] Remove key events","user":{"login":"PxlBuzzard","id":512416,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/512416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PxlBuzzard","html_url":"https://github.com/PxlBuzzard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PxlBuzzard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PxlBuzzard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PxlBuzzard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PxlBuzzard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PxlBuzzard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PxlBuzzard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PxlBuzzard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PxlBuzzard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PxlBuzzard/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":94619807,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Circular-Studios/Dash/labels/ready","name":"ready","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"ColdenCullen","id":1354824,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1354824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ColdenCullen","html_url":"https://github.com/ColdenCullen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ColdenCullen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ColdenCullen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ColdenCullen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ColdenCullen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ColdenCullen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ColdenCullen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ColdenCullen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ColdenCullen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ColdenCullen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"ColdenCullen","id":1354824,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1354824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ColdenCullen","html_url":"https://github.com/ColdenCullen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ColdenCullen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ColdenCullen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ColdenCullen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ColdenCullen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ColdenCullen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ColdenCullen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ColdenCullen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ColdenCullen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ColdenCullen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-04-21T20:47:06Z","updated_at":"2014-09-07T21:30:38Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"Right now you can only add key events.
