we would consider sampler state in D3D is stored per-texture in GL, so you have to have the correct active texture unit & texture bindings active before you call glTexParameter within SamplerState.Activate().\n\nThis change stores the \"last SamplerState used\" on the Texture instance, to avoid redundant glTexParameter calls.\n\nIt's possible this might make some redundant glActiveTexture parameters in cases where you use a single texture with frequently changing sampler states, maybe there is a better way to design this... it would be nice if it was somehow integrated with the related loop in

At least on the devices I've tested, `audioManager.GetStreamVolume(Stream.Music);` returns the value you've set the device volume to using the hardware buttons. The end result was that sound effects had the device volume multiplied in again making them very quiet in comparison to the music, particularly when the device volume was low.\n\nIt's probably a good idea if some other people test this. Perhaps there was some reason the code was there, ie different behaviour in an old API or particular device.

But, one major issue I ran into when building it though was a bunch of errors that showed up in the Windows Framework, under Windows/Audio/Sound.cs which seemed to be namespace issues between OpenTK.Audio and OpenTK.Audio.OpenAL.\n\nIt basically ended with me manually putting in either of the specific namespaces in front of all the variables causing the errors (so like, OpenTK.Audio.\"variable\" or OpenTK.Audio.OpenAL.\"variable\").\n\nHaving only been looking at this for like... two days in my spare time, I have no idea what either of these specific namespaces contribute to or how they work, I basically just did this until I had no errors.

Windows 8 Metro, MonoGame is not firing the MediaPlayer.PlaybackEvent which is used to detect a song has paused or stopped (finished) playing.\n\nLooking at the code that sets up this event in MonoGame (MediaPlayer.cs) we can see that it is using SharpDX's MediaEngine wrapper:\n\n``` C#\n        static MediaPlayer()\n        {            \n            MediaManager.Startup(true);\n\n            using (var factory = new MediaEngineClassFactory())\n            {\n                var mediaEngine = new MediaEngine(factory, null, MediaEngineCreateflags.Audioonly);\n                _mediaEngineEx = mediaEngine.QueryInterface<MediaEngineEx>();\n            }\n\n            _mediaEngineEx.PlaybackEvent += MediaEngineExOnPlaybackEvent;            \n        }\n```\n\nSo it is trying to new up an instance of MediaEngine and then hook the PlaybackEvent which is used to route to the XNA MediaPlayer's version of PlaybackEvent that XNA devs can hook into.\n\nThis all seems correct.  However, the event doesn't actually fire due to what I consider a quirk of SharpDX's event.\n\nThe MediaEngine constructor can also take in a playbackEvent callback.  I assume this maps directly to setting PlaybackEvent internally.\n\nSure enough, changing the new MediaEngine(...) line in the code snippet above to pass MediaEngineExOnPlaybackEvent as the 4th argument (and then skipping the manual event hook at the bottom) fixes the issue.\n\nThere may be more that is needed to understand why += doesn't work, but passing it in the constructor does.\n\nEither way, on Windows 8 Metro the event does not fire today and above is the workaround, if someone could get that into the main branch I would appreciate it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/866/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/865","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/865/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/865/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/865/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/865","id":7555528,"number":865,"title":"ColorWriteChannels is in wrong namespace","user":{"login":"bquintero","id":2547865,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2547865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bquintero","html_url":"https://github.com/bquintero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bquintero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bquintero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bquintero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bquintero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bquintero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bquintero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bquintero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bquintero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bquintero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/3","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestone/3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/3/labels","id":90740,"number":3,"title":"3.0 Release","description":"","creator":null,"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":98,"state":"closed","created_at":"2012-03-01T08:54:38Z","updated_at":"2013-09-24T05:36:54Z","due_on":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2013-09-24T05:36:54Z"},"comments":3,"created_at":"2012-10-12T22:03:23Z","updated_at":"2012-10-16T11:30:41Z","closed_at":"2012-10-16T11:30:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"ColorWriteChannels is in the wrong namespace.
