When pushing a thumbstick toward the min/max of an axis, the other axis is clamped to some extent. This results in thumbsticks being inaccurate or sticked to the min/max of an axis.\n\nExample: when I fully push a thumbstick to the right (0.0f;1.0f), then if I steer slowly up/down, there is a range of about 10° where the values are blocked to (0.0f;1.0f).\n\nThe culprit is `GamePadDeadZone.IndependentAxes`. https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/fcf6e5d5646f8d5e06d02c72c01ed881e2f0563f/MonoGame.Framework/Input/GamePad.XInput.cs#L196\nIndependently calculating axis dead zone for thumbsticks is not relevant. Thumbsticks should behave like circular inputs even if they are on independent axes driver-wise. Hence, I simplified `ConvertThumbStick` to proceed all data as circular.\n\nAs far as I checked, it only concerns the XInput / Windows target.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3305/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3304","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3304/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3304/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3304/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3304","id":52701023,"number":3304,"title":"AudioBuffer Cleanup","user":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-12-22T23:47:23Z","updated_at":"2014-12-23T00:22:18Z","closed_at":"2014-12-23T00:22:12Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/3304","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3304","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3304.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3304.patch"},"body":"This is a follow up to #3287.

If I tap the top of the screen the Y of the position is 0 and if I tap slightly below it it is still 0 (but it should be more than 0). It seems that I get touch positions as if my app had a status bar and therefore all positions are offset by 17 pixels. Reproduced on both iOS 7.1 and iOS 8.1.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3293","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3293/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3293/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3293/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3293","id":52520396,"number":3293,"title":"graphics.IsFullScreen = true; (not working)","user":{"login":"DarrenAtherton49","id":7551160,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7551160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarrenAtherton49","html_url":"https://github.com/DarrenAtherton49","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarrenAtherton49/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarrenAtherton49/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarrenAtherton49/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarrenAtherton49/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarrenAtherton49/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarrenAtherton49/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarrenAtherton49/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarrenAtherton49/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarrenAtherton49/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-12-19T19:39:03Z","updated_at":"2014-12-29T23:26:12Z","closed_at":"2014-12-29T23:26:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"As title ^\nUsing this in the Game1 constructor on Windows 8.1.\nCode snippet:\n\n```\n        graphics = new GraphicsDeviceManager(this);\n        graphics.PreferredBackBufferWidth = screenWidth;\n        graphics.PreferredBackBufferHeight = screenHeight;\n        graphics.IsFullScreen = true;\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3292","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3292/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3292/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3292/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3292","id":52449263,"number":3292,"title":"Pipeline tool - context menu terminology","user":{"login":"dneelyep","id":947621,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/947621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dneelyep","html_url":"https://github.com/dneelyep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dneelyep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dneelyep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dneelyep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dneelyep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dneelyep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dneelyep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dneelyep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dneelyep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dneelyep/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":13477514,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/ContentPipeline","name":"ContentPipeline","color":"ededed","default":false},{"id":525946,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/Tools","name":"Tools","color":"83d5fe","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2014-12-19T05:26:46Z","updated_at":"2015-04-03T15:53:26Z","closed_at":"2015-04-03T15:53:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The difference between the \"New Item\" and \"Add Item\" context menu entries in the pipeline tool isn't obvious without clicking through to see what each does.\n\nI suggest renaming \"Add Item\" to \"Add Existing Item\".
