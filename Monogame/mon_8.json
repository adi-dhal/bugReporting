For debug builds, it allows developers to retrieve DirectX debugging messages directly in their game.\r\n\r\nFor a very long time now, Protobuild has by default generated projects with \"Enable unmanaged code debugging\" turned on, so that when you run and debug MonoGame games in Visual Studio, you can see the DirectX log messages in the Visual Studio output window.  These messages are essential to determining things like why a shader doesn't work, and for knowing when you're passing invalid parameters to APIs. \r\n\r\nHowever, this is a trade-off: when you enable unmanaged code debugging, Edit and Continue no longer works, which is a very useful part of the Visual Studio debugging experience. If you turn off unmanaged code debugging, you can't see the DirectX error messages.\r\n\r\nBy surfacing this API, we can turn unmanaged code debugging off by default in Protobuild, and developers can retrieve the DirectX messages directly in their game.  This allows Edit and Continue to work, while still being able to see critical DirectX warnings and errors about API usage.\r\n\r\nThis API only works in debug builds (because only in debug builds does MonoGame create a DirectX device with debug layers), and only works on DirectX 11 and higher (and I believe Windows 8 and later).\r\n\r\nIn future, I want to add APIs to this call that allow setting names on buffers and textures, so that these names (annotations as DirectX calls them) appear in graphics profiling and debugging tools.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5778","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5778/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5778/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5778/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5778","id":236435794,"number":5778,"title":"Remove all MonoMac supporting code","user":{"login":"hach-que","id":504826,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/504826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que","html_url":"https://github.com/hach-que","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-06-16T09:54:37Z","updated_at":"2017-06-17T04:31:38Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/5778","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5778","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5778.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5778.patch"},"body":"This removes all PLATFORM_MACOS_LEGACY code branches in preparation for the removal of MonoMac support.\r\n\r\nSee #4693 and https://github.com/Protobuild/Protobuild/issues/164.

just tested an Empty game project on Windows Universal Platform and DesktopGL I noticed that on desktop when I close the game the methods OnExiting,UnloadContent and Disposed are called, but not on Windows Universal Platform only the methode OnDeactivated is called.\r\n\r\nIs this behavior is intended? How can I dispose correctly my game on UWP?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5762/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5761","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5761/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5761/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5761/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5761","id":234476954,"number":5761,"title":"Missing Texture2D.FromFile ?","user":{"login":"DDReaper","id":1793042,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1793042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper","html_url":"https://github.com/DDReaper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-06-08T10:09:02Z","updated_at":"2017-07-19T07:09:15Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In upgrading the ZiggyWare blog posts, I came across the good old Texture2D.FromFile method.\r\n\r\nI know this was a XNA 1 artifact but this seems a much easier function for users not using the content pipeline to use that the current Texture2D.FromStream\r\n\r\nAny reasons why we couldn't add such a method ?\r\n\r\nThis would simply wrap the existing FromStream function to actually load the texture from a stream safely and return the resultant Texture2D.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5761/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5760","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5760/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5760/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5760/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5760","id":234302884,"number":5760,"title":"[OpenAL] No sounds playing","user":{"login":"Osuology","id":19627458,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19627458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Osuology","html_url":"https://github.com/Osuology","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Osuology/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Osuology/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Osuology/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Osuology/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Osuology/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Osuology/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Osuology/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Osuology/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Osuology/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-06-07T18:34:03Z","updated_at":"2017-06-07T21:20:20Z","closed_at":"2017-06-07T21:20:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"In all my projects that have been made in GL, they do not play sounds.

per #5749, this is the beginning of porting Riemer's XNA tutorials over to the MonoGame documentation.

I do think it would probably be a good idea to contact Riemer again just to make sure it's acceptable for us to use the tutorial content in this way.\r\n\r\nI made a few assumptions in this PR about how the tutorial might be formatted and placed in the Documentation section of the MonoGame website, so if any of the assumptions were made in error, please let me know.\r\n\r\nAlso, would it be a good idea to structure the .md files for the tutorial port within folders within the Documentation folder?
