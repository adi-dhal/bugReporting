usage scenario:\n\nYou have a SpriteSheetImporter and SpriteSheetProcessor. The importer takes an xml file which lists images to combine into a sprite sheet. In some cases it is convenient to instead of listing every single file to express it as a wildcard, eg: \"*.png\" such that all png's in the same folder as the 'sheet.xml' are included in the sheet.\n\nThe problem is, you can later add a new png to the folder, and it does not trigger a rebuild of the sheet - because the pipeline is only watching the xml file, or if you bothered to AddDependency for each of the files it would still only be watching the files that were there the last time it was built - it still doesn't watch for -new- files which would match the wildcard.\n\nProposed fix:\n\nAddDependency(\"*.png\") ... \n\nThis wildcard include would need to be evaluated when the pipeline is checking if a build is required. A rebuild is required if: any file in the new set is not in the prev set or has been modified since then, or if any file in the prev set is no longer in the new set.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5198","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5198/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5198/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5198/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5198","id":180147648,"number":5198,"title":"Fix
