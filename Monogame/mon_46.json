a couple tweets with Ethan (https://twitter.com/mrhelmut/status/710056044500807681), it may be interesting to update `OpenTK.dll.config` (and the future MonoGame.Framework.dll.config once OpenTK is replaced) to look for OpenAL Soft dylib instead of the OS X system library (and then push the dependencies to MonoGame/MonoKickstart, and make sure that it works on XamMac).\n\nThis would help maintaining the OpenAL implementation across the DesktopGL platforms in the future.\n\nI've already seen the Apple implementation having differences (e.g. different return values than oal soft) and some 8-22khz sounds don't render the same than on other

PR fixes a few issues\n1. Corrects ALL the .mgcb files in the XS templates to have the correct BuildAction of MonoGameContentReference\n2. Upgraded XamMac, Xamarin.Mac to use DeskopGL as it seems a better fit and works!\n3. Upgraded the MonoMac + XamMac build to auto include the outputs of the Content compilation\n   this will mean users no longer have to link those files manually.\n   We had to do it this way because neither of those project types use MSBuild.\n4. Alters the Title Container for DesktopGL so that on MacOS it will first look for the ../Resources directory (which is where BundleResource items should be) before falling back to the root directory where the app is.\n5. Changes to the Reference HintPath Fixup code to make sure that for MonoMac and XamMac absolute paths are used and specific versions of OpenTK are used.\n6. Fixed the MonoMac template to NOT use Nuget just like the others this is a side effect of point 5.\n\n@mrhelmut @KonajuGames This works well on my machine could use some additional testing though. Note this should only really effect new projects.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4621","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4621/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4621/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4621/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4621","id":139607919,"number":4621,"title":"Reordered Member to match Style and Coding guidelines","user":{"login":"MaxPlay","id":5209209,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5209209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxPlay","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxPlay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxPlay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxPlay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxPlay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxPlay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxPlay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxPlay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxPlay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxPlay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxPlay/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-03-09T15:27:05Z","updated_at":"2016-03-10T12:51:52Z","closed_at":"2016-03-09T17:58:31Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/4621","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4621","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4621.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4621.patch"},"body":"The Microsoft.XNA.Framework.Rectangle struct had the Property \"Center\" at the wrong location with the wrong formatting.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4620","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4620/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4620/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4620/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4620","id":139533603,"number":4620,"title":"[Pipeline Tool] Filter Output bug with spritefonts","user":{"login":"cra0zy","id":6773302,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6773302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy","html_url":"https://github.com/cra0zy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":13,"created_at":"2016-03-09T10:14:07Z","updated_at":"2017-05-17T21:05:51Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I was missing the font in my system, and filter output wasn't giving a useful part of the error.\n\nThe log:\n\n```\n/home/harry/Content/Fonts/Interface.spritefont\n    Building Font /home/harry/Content/Fonts/Monospace\n    System.Exception: Could not load /home/harry/Content/Fonts/Monospace\n  at Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content.Pipeline.Processors.FontDescriptionProcessor.Process (Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content.Pipeline.Graphics.FontDescription input, Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content.Pipeline.ContentProcessorContext context) <0x40dc0710 + 0x0042f> in <filename unknown>:0 \n/home/harry/Content/Fonts/Interface.spritefont: error: Index was out of range.
