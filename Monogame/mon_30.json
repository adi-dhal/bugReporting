Maybe even abstract some of the checks up to Texture itself since this code can be shared for the most part and it'll make the checks consistent for all Texture types. \n\nI just realized the same methods exist for Vertex/IndexBuffers, not sure if we should share all around or just do textures. Thoughts on this?\n\nAlso, there are cases the checks miss because sizeof(T) was is always expected to be equal to 4 (which is expected to be the size of the format, but that isn't always the case either) and the size of T is not explicitly checked while in XNA it is. I'm happy to fix all this once we decide on the above

#4824. Added the `Color(byte, byte, byte, byte)` constructor and made `Color(uint)` public. Also added some simple unit tests for the constructors and corrected a minor typo.\n\nIn the issue, there was some discussion about a separate `Color.FromBytes()` method, but I opted for another constructor overload, since the parameters must be `byte`s in either case. I did not add a `Color(byte, byte, byte)` overload with constant alpha to avoid excessive overloads - this is a more \"advanced\" overload after all. This can be changed if it makes the API cleaner, of course.\n\nAs expected, the new `byte` overload is clearly (40-60%) faster than the `int` version in a quick microbenchmark.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5117/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5116","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5116/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5116/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5116/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5116","id":171411793,"number":5116,"title":"PixelBitmapContent<Vector4>

my XNA game, I have a custom processor that builds a spritesheet of normal maps.\nI use `Texture2D<Vector4>` to hold the normals.\n\nThe sprite packer code does not work in MonoGame, though.\nThe following code works in XNA but MonoGame throws an exception:\n\nSystem.InvalidOperationException: Could not copy between Vector4 and Vector4\n\n```\nPixelBitmapContent<Vector4> source,
