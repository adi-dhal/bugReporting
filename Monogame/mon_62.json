made 2 changes to the content manager when I was working on a project and came across some memory problems\n#1\n\nI noticed the absence of this crucial function, Unload(asset), in the content manager so I decided to add it. This is essentially an alternative for (resource).Dispose() when the resource is loaded through a content manager.\n#2\n\nAs much as I hated to, I had to use GC.Collect() in the ReadAsset and Unload functions, this seemed to be the only way to prevent crashing on devices with limited resources when attempting to \"replace\" current loaded data as in, for example, a theme change or moving from level to level with largely varying content. It also seems to be the only way to prevent a memory leak from occurring especially on Windows UAP because of the rather delayed collection intervals, the following graphs should clarify what I mean:\n\nThe current memory stats while I continuously switch between 2 sets of textures on UAP:\n\nWithout collect calls:\n![nogc](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10683997/10112741/23813bc4-63de-11e5-9f5e-a464837085b6.PNG)\n\nThe memory simply grows endlessly in a memory leak resembling pattern. This memory is NOT reusable as this test would crash the 512mb emulator or a low end device immediately (Also reported on android by a project member). The memory is occasionally collected by the GC to a slightly lower value but this behavior would continue until the memory is out.\n\nAfter adding collect calls:\n![agc](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10683997/10112869/1abd2e48-63df-11e5-96f6-b77a3408920e.PNG)\n\nThe issue has been reduced to those spikes, which I have found to be associated with the async nature of the WINRT file system, but so far I have not thought of a solution to this probelm. Also calling GC.Collect() once after the loading process on game side does not reduce memory usage as opposed to the call once per ReadAsset.\n\nNote: Visual studio reformatted the document (which I have found conforming to the guidelines) so here are the lines I edited to make it easier for anyone interested in seeing the actual change.\n215                  Unload(asset)\n248,377,687

#3540\n\nStuff done:\n- Fixes BadWindow, BadCursor and OpenTK: Failed to make context current errors\n  - was occurring because of window getting Disposed before the rest of the things completed like disposing of Textures(which require a valid window handle) and was also because of Run Loop stopping with processing of events for the window which would close the window and also make that handle invalid.\n- Fixes AL Sources Error\n  - whoever wrote the code didn't dispose of the sources at the end... nothing major\n- Fixes AL Device Not Closed error\n  - was occurring because of the BadWindow and BadCursor errors were stopping dispose from completing\n- Fixed native stacktrace error\n  - was occurring because of _toolkit.Dispose()... it's an error within OpenTK, but since _toolkit was an unused variable I just removed it\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4152","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4152/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4152/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4152/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4152","id":108286049,"number":4152,"title":"Added

order to support the Content.Builder.targets on\nMacOS we firstly needed to install the Tooling and\nAssemblies in the right location. In this case\n/Library/Frameworks/MonoGame.framework/vX.X.X.X\n\nSymbolic links are required to get everything working\nright. In this case we need a v3.0 link in\n/Library/Frameworks/MonoGame.framework but we also need\nsome links in the Mono.framework as well. Namely\n\n/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/External/MonoGame\n\nWe also need to add an Imports element to the csproj files.\nNow the current MonoDevleop/Xamarin Studio templating system\ndoes not support doing this directly. So a new MSBuild\nprocessing class has been added to the addin. This class\nwill check if the project is a \"MonoGame\" project (is references\nMonoGame.Framework.dll or has a MonoGamePlatform element) and\ninject the required data into the csproj.\n\nThe templates have been left referencing the Nuget packages\nfor now.\n\nModified the ContentBuilder targets file to Batch its items\nthis is to get round issues when running under xbuild on Mac.\n\nUpdated templates to use a new MonoGameInstallDirectory property\nrather than $(MSBuildProgramFiles32) so that we can use the\nsame paths for references.\n\nIt also adds the followiing to the projects\n\n```\n<MonoGameInstallDirectory Condition=\"'$(OS)' != 'Unix' \">$(MSBuildProgramFiles32)</MonoGameInstallDirectory>\n<MonoGameInstallDirectory Condition=\"'$(OS)' == 'Unix'

All sounds start to crackle a lot. `MediaPlayer` / `Song` are not affected (which seems normal since `MediaPlayer` uses MediaFoundation and not XAudio2).\n2. **Freezes / stalls**: when sounds start to crackle, it is almost certain that playing a non pooled `SoundEffectInstance` (i.e. through `SoundEffect.CreateInstance()`) will totally stall the game for several seconds. `SoundEffect.Play()` (i.e. pooled instances) doesn't stall the game.\n\nI'm totally puzzled about these issues and we haven't been able to reproduce them internally which makes me think that they are related to specific sound chips and possibly driver issues.\n\nIt may also be only related to looped `SoundEffectInstance`, because they tend to make the game stall more often/quickly.\n\nI also don't know why only non-pooled instances are making the game to stall. I would suspect an hardware instance limit, but since the pool doesn't have a limit on Windows platforms, the problem would have been exposed way before any non-pooled instance is played.\n\nI haven't found the time to test that against OpenAL.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4145","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4145/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4145/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4145/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4145","id":107235501,"number":4145,"title":"Windows 10 \"There may have been a missing assembly.\"","user":{"login":"SergioAwoke","id":4298411,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4298411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioAwoke","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioAwoke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioAwoke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioAwoke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioAwoke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioAwoke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioAwoke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioAwoke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioAwoke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioAwoke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioAwoke/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-09-18T16:33:52Z","updated_at":"2015-09-24T22:33:55Z","closed_at":"2015-09-24T22:33:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello Community,\n\nI'm building a Windows 10 Universal game.

bit.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4132","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4132/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4132/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4132/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4132","id":105687424,"number":4132,"title":"Make

I would like to get the attention of the devs about an issue that currently makes `MouseState` unusable. I'm using the latest dev build of MonoGame, `3.5.0.574`, I believe? So here's an example code:\n\n``` c#\nprotected Texture2D cursorTex;\nprotected Rectangle cursorRect;\nprotected MouseState mouseState;\n\npublic virtual void LoadContent(ContentManager Content)\n{\n    content = new ContentManager(Content.ServiceProvider, \"Content\");\n    cursorTex = content.Load<Texture2D>(@\"Graphics/Cursors/cursor_0\");\n}\n\npublic virtual void Update(GameTime gameTime)\n{\n    mouseState = Mouse.GetState();\n    cursorRect = new Rectangle(mouseState.X, mouseState.Y, cursorTex.Width, cursorTex.Height);\n}\n\npublic virtual void Draw(SpriteBatch spriteBatch)\n{\n    spriteBatch.Draw(cursorTex, cursorRect, Color.White);\n}\n```\n\nAbove, I am trying to create a custom cursor for my game. But when I debug, the cursor image stays at the `0, 0` coordinates of the screen and won't move. Could the image be the problem? It is a BMP file 32x32 pixels with magenta background for transparency.\n\nWhy do `Mouse.GetState().X` and `Mouse.GetState().Y` always return `0, 0`? I tested this exact same code in XNA and it worked (although my cursor texture had offset compared to the default windows mouse pointer). In my override methods I call `base.LoadContent(Content);`, `base.Update(gameTime);` and `base.Draw(spriteBatch);` and everything else works except the cursor. Did it work before? What was the default behavior? Can a developer test the issue as well?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4130/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4862","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507242346","x-github-request-id":"9E0A:6E60:EE0D3F:247B4AF:59D6A737","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=63>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=200>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=61>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"9beeed97787c50a9843c8de6d8f436e0\"","status":"200 OK"}}
