Graphics Debugger in Visual Studio 2013-2015 can actually debug pixels where you can step through the vertex/pixel shader. However, when your HLSL file is using #includes, the debugger will point to incorrect lines in the HLSL source when stepping through.\n\n2MGFX runs the preprocessor on the hlsl file, which creates a temporary source code that has the #included files embedded, and that source is passed later to the DirectX shader compiler. Therefore the line number information is generated based on that temporary file.\n\nTo fix it, use the original source code, and implement the D3DCompiler's Include interface to load the #includes during compilation.\nHere is a basic implementation.

is in response to issue #4202. I can't say that it will resolve the issue, but it should definitely at least improve things a little. (UPDATE: @bousquetm confirmed that there was a big improvement with my changes, so I think it's now fair to say that this resolves #4202)\n\nIn summary, this PR tries to better consider the inaccuracy of \"Sleep\" and use it more conservatively to try and avoid overshooting the desired update time. The side effect of this is that there'll be some CPU spinning, but the CPU usage increase should be minimal.\n\nFor Windows platforms (except for WinRT), it now considers the timer resolution when sleeping. It will try to sleep as long as possible without overshooting, and then spin the CPU for the remainder. My tests have shown this to be very accurate, and in theory it should never actually overshoot due to oversleeping.\n\nI couldn't use this trick on other platforms though. So for other platforms, it instead only tries to sleep when the next update time is still at least 1ms away, otherwise it will spin the CPU for the remainder. Also, to further reduce the chance of overshooting, it will only perform a \"Sleep(1)\" each time it does sleep.\n\nLastly, @nkast also pointed out that `Task.Delay` (used by WinRT in place of `Thread.Sleep`) was generating garbage. So I've changed it to use `Monitor.Wait` instead, which should be just as accurate without the garbage generation. I wasn't able to properly test this though with a Windows Store app.\n\nWhile I was able to test all of the 3 methods on my Windows 7 machine and prove they at least work on that platform, I wasn't able to test any of this on any other platforms. WinRT in particular probably needs a good test as it's now using `Monitor.Wait` to sleep. The other platforms should be ok though as the change was much less significant, but it would be great if someone could test them also.\n\n**UPDATE (30-Oct):**\nAfter some discussion, it was decided that only the Windows platform would attempt to sleep when using fixed time step because we can still maintain timing accuracy. For all other platforms we couldn't guarantee accuracy when sleeping though, so it now spins the CPU instead (which is what XNA seems to do as well). And to compensate for this, the `Game.InactiveSleepTime` feature from XNA (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.xna.framework.game.inactivesleeptime.aspx) was also implemented so that sleeping would be performed when the game window is inactive.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4207/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4206","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4206/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4206/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4206/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4206","id":113528393,"number":4206,"title":"Support for playing a song from a given start position.","user":{"login":"danzel","id":393086,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/393086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danzel","html_url":"https://github.com/danzel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danzel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danzel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danzel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danzel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danzel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danzel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danzel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danzel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danzel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2015-10-27T08:12:56Z","updated_at":"2015-11-21T21:11:05Z","closed_at":"2015-11-21T15:28:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/4206","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4206","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4206.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4206.patch"},"body":"Implemented and tested on Android, iOS, WMS (Windows).\n\nThe WMS version was the trickiest, if you specify the start position immediately when you try `_session.Start` it doesn't work, you need to wait until the Topology is ready before you can play from anywhere that isn't the beginning.

When drawing a sprite that moves at constant speed, the animation \"stutters\" and is not smooth, even though the program runs at 60fps. It seems that sometimes the draw is delaye or something.\n\nHere's a very simple example to reproduce the bug (the texture red is just a 64x64 red texture):\n\n``` C#\nusing Microsoft.Xna.Framework;\nusing Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics;\nusing Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input;\n\nnamespace MonogameTest\n{\n    public class Game1 : Game\n    {\n        public Game1()\n        {\n            _graphics = new GraphicsDeviceManager(this);\n            Content.RootDirectory = \"Content\";\n            IsFixedTimeStep = true;\n        }\n\n        ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Override Methods\n\n        protected override void LoadContent()\n        {\n            _spriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(GraphicsDevice);\n            _texture = Content.Load<Texture2D>(\"red\");\n            _pos = Point.Zero;\n        }\n\n        protected override void Update(GameTime gameTime)\n        {\n            if (Keyboard.GetState().IsKeyDown(Keys.Space))\n            {\n                _pos.X = 0;\n            }\n            _pos.X += 6;\n\n            base.Update(gameTime);\n        }\n\n        protected override void Draw(GameTime gameTime)\n        {\n            GraphicsDevice.Clear(Color.CornflowerBlue);\n\n            _spriteBatch.Begin();\n            _spriteBatch.Draw(_texture, _pos.ToVector2(), Color.White);\n            _spriteBatch.End();\n\n            base.Draw(gameTime);\n        }\n\n        ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Private Members\n\n        private GraphicsDeviceManager _graphics;\n        private SpriteBatch _spriteBatch;\n        private Texture2D _texture;\n        private Point _pos;\n\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI've reproduced it Monogame 3.4 and also with the last unstable version (currently 3.5.0.703). I also tried on 2 different computers, same problem with both.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nMartin\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4202/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4201","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4201/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4201/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4201/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4201","id":112668613,"number":4201,"title":"Fixed

recently been profiling my game a bit (using CLRProfiler) to try and find code generating excess garbage, and I came across the following from MonoGame (this is from the heap allocation graph):\n![profile1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5249498/10633916/b1f0a33a-7820-11e5-8eff-3c8e69372028.png)\nI took a closer look at the method in question and found that there was some LINQ being used which seemed to be the culprit:\n\n``` C#\nforeach (var window in _allWindows.Where(w => w.Game == Game))\n    window.UpdateMouseState();\n```\n\nSo I changed it to the following and that seemed to clean it up:\n\n``` C#\nforeach (var window in _allWindows)\n    if (window.Game == Game)\n

This is not true in practice.\n  Example: One PipelineBuildEvent stores the parameter (\"ColorKeyEnabled\", true). The second PipelineBuildEvent does not have a matching entry. The two PipelineBuildEvents might still be equivalent. We need to compare the parameter with the default value of the content processor.\n- _Problem 2: \"The order of the assets in the content project should not matter, but it does matter.\"_\n  Example: ModelA, ModelB, TextureC are included in the content project. Both models reference TextureC.\n  Currently when the order in the content project is ModelA, ModelB, TextureC, the TextureC is output as \"Texture_0.xnb\" and \"Texture.xnb\". If the order is TextureC, ModelA, ModelB, the output is only \"Texture.xnb\", which is in in my opinion the correct result.\n  To solve the problem, all asset that need to be registered as PipelineBuildEvents before building any assets. Then it is possible to correctly resolve external references.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4197","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4197/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4197/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4197/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4197","id":112504426,"number":4197,"title":"Removed GamePadThumbSticks.Gate property","user":{"login":"MichaelDePiazzi","id":5249498,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5249498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi","html_url":"https://github.com/MichaelDePiazzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-10-21T03:21:20Z","updated_at":"2015-10-27T00:43:10Z","closed_at":"2015-10-26T18:45:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/4197","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4197","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4197.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4197.patch"},"body":"Closes #4170\n\nThis PR removes the superfluous `GamePadThumbSticks.Gate` property as discussed in issue #4170.

The hashing and caching of vertex input layouts is also fixed/improved.\n\nBefore writing this code, we have reviewed the related issues for these topics:\n- GraphicsDevice.DrawInstancedPrimitives API not yet implemented. #913\n- GraphicsDevice.SetVertexBuffers API is not yet implemented #914\n- Implemented GraphicsDevice.SetVertexBuffers(...) #3276\n\nThis implementation is used successfully in the DigitalRune Engine for mesh instancing and morph target animation. We have also added some simple unit tests.\n\nThere is one important change regarding the vertex attribute semantics **SV_Position** and **POSITION** in shaders:\nThe recommended semantic for the vertex input element which describes the vertex position is **POSITION**. However, the XNA stock effects use **SV_Position**. This is allowed in DirectX but it is better to use **SV_Position** (\"system-value position\") only for the vertex shader output and pixel shader input. \nThis is important when using morph targets. Each morph target mesh has a **POSITION0** element. At runtime the morph target vertex streams are matched and combined to a single input layout with **POSITION0/1/2/3**. This is not possible with **SV_Position** because **SV_Position1/2/3** is not a valid semantic.\nTherefore, we have changed the C# code and shaders to use **POSITION** for vertex inputs. \nThe new code contains a fallback to handle shaders with **SV_Position**, but we recommend to only use **POSITION** for vertex shader input for all future MonoGame shaders.\n\nThe vertex input type for BLENDINDICES has been changed from int4 to uint4. This prevents SharpDX warnings when run on debug device. (The problem is that the MonoGame content pipeline outputs Byte4 for BLENDINDICES. MonoGame does not have a signed integer format that matches int4.)\n\nThis PR also fixes a minor bug in the GraphicsDevice OpenGL code: The flag **_vertexBufferDirty** was never reset to false.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4194","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4194/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4194/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4194/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4194","id":112398810,"number":4194,"title":".NET
