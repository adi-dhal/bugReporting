couple of questions came up while integrating this:\n\nEnded up making a PVRTCBitmapContent, since it will need different implementations of TryCopyTo/From(). Seeing all of the texture formats we'll end up supporting, should we have a single CompressedBitmapContent class that implements the different texture formats?\n\nHow much control are we giving to the user when it comes to texture formats. Technically, PVRTC and DXT can work on Android. What would be the right way of choosing the output format?\n\nPVRTC can do either 2BPP or 4BPP. Where should this be exposed to the user? For now I just forced 4BPP.\n\nChanges in this PR allow us to move PVRTexLibC out of MonoGame's repo, and into it's own. This way we open the possibility of other developers working on it. I'll be submitting a PR to the Dependency repo that moves these .dll's from Tools to ThirdParty. Don't merge this until that's complete.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1301/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1300","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1300/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1300/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1300/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1300","id":10654468,"number":1300,"title":"TEST DO NOT MERGE","user":{"login":"dellis1972","id":810617,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/810617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972","html_url":"https://github.com/dellis1972","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-02-05T15:36:54Z","updated_at":"2014-07-11T06:42:27Z","closed_at":"2013-02-05T16:00:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/1300","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1300","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1300.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1300.patch"},"body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1299","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1299/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1299/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1299/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1299","id":10645431,"number":1299,"title":"WinRT Guide.BeginShowKeyboardInput(...)","user":{"login":"nkast","id":3018589,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3018589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast","html_url":"https://github.com/nkast","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2013-02-05T10:58:00Z","updated_at":"2013-04-01T06:16:07Z","closed_at":"2013-02-12T05:31:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Any ideas on how this could be implemented?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1299/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1298","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1298/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1298/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1298/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1298","id":10640984,"number":1298,"title":"Suggestion -

This works fine for a single GLControl.  When multiple controls are present, basic GL manipulations can be performed on all controls, such as color clearing or GL immediate mode drawing, but MonoGame routines will only have an effect in one of the controls.\n\nI've provided a test case (http://hocuspocus.taloncrossing.com/rii/GLControlTest.zip), which is a slightly modified version of the Winforms Series tutorial.  Both controls render a triangle in XNA, but only the left control renders in MonoGame.  MonoGame/OpenTK assemblies and pdbs included, since it needs a build of OpenTK.GLControl, and GraphicsDevice.cs was modified slightly.
