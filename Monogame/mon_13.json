Which is infuriating. But can be turned off if you have the HWND through some special Win32 API magic.  \r\n* So I had to add the `SDL_GetWindowWMInfo` function pointer, and then add a new HWND property since GameWindow.Handle and SDLGameWindow._handle point to the SDL_Window and not the HWND.  https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/compare/develop...robert-wallis:HWND?expand=0\r\n* Or if I made `Sdl` `public` then I wouldn't have to create the new property.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of PR would you rather see?

`checkedRect` change in Texture2D Set/GetData is broken for compressed texture formats:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/Graphics/Texture2D.cs#L149\r\n\r\nIt doesn't consider that for compressed formats there is a minimum mipmap size that must be enforced.  So it passes the incorrect rectangle down to methods for setting the texture data.\r\n\r\nIMO we sure purge this  `checkedRect` business entirely from the code base.\r\n\r\nIn particular the removal of calling SetData with a `null` rectangle is likely a performance hit.\r\n\r\nI am willing to bet that for example `GL.TexSubImage2D` is slower than `GL.TexImage2D` when setting texture data.  Same with the methods under DirectX when the full texture level was being set instead of a sub-rectangle of the texture surface.\r\n\r\nIMO we need to refactor all this to restore the old behavior for `null` rectangles and fix the checking when a rectangle is passed to consider compression needs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4911","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507242346","x-github-request-id":"9341:572B:D2EEE2:1BDEAAF:59D6A679","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=14>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=200>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=12>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"a1a8f9f833d9456ba51925886c53dddc\"","status":"200 OK"}}
