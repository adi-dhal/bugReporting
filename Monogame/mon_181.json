there,\nSince I diddn't get a response on the Codeplex site but need it anyway, I implemented ogg/vorbis and mp3 sound support for the Linux MediaPlayer.\nIt is a simple reimplementation of the Song class to use Tao.SDL for playing sound.\nIt also includes a few lines of initialization in OpenTKGamePlatform (but that #if'd to be only used on Linux).\nIt also implements the MediaStateChanged event that should be provided by the MediaPlayer class (this will work on Linux. On other platforms, only user-invoked state-changes are reported, such as when the Stop() method is called. A MediaStateCahnged event because a song has finished will only be invoked on Linux).\nIf you prefere to not be dependant on Tao.SDL that much, feel free to reject this pull request. I'm going to use it anyway :p\n\nNote: this does break old code in rare circumstances. SDL can only do resampling if the sampling-rate is a multiple of 11,025 Hz. So if there are files played that are e.g. 48,000 Hz, sound may be distorted. Most common sampling rates work good, however.\n\nNote2: This code should not only support ogg and mp3, but all formats that are supported by SDL Mixer.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/572/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/571","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/571/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/571/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/571/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/571","id":5518309,"number":571,"title":"Maximize/Unmaximize and fullscreen fixes","user":{"login":"b3nn0","id":1858945,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1858945?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/b3nn0","html_url":"https://github.com/b3nn0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b3nn0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b3nn0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b3nn0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b3nn0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b3nn0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b3nn0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b3nn0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b3nn0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b3nn0/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2012-07-10T08:51:04Z","updated_at":"2014-07-05T13:59:54Z","closed_at":"2012-07-13T07:12:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/571","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/571","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/571.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/571.patch"},"body":"This fixes the Issue for OpenTK game windows (at least on linux), that fullscreen-mode can't be toggled during runtime.

The destination is 5 times the size of the source. What is happening is that when the destination rect is different then the source, the rotation origin changes and the object doesn't rotate around it's center anymore.\nI'm almost certain there's a problem, because I've inspect the inputs for the SpriteBatch.Draw call on both Windows and Mac, and the values are exactly the same.\nIn windows the object rotates nicely in the center, on Mac, the objects rotates like the earth around the sun.\n\nHere's the method with the issue:\n\npublic void Draw (Texture2D texture,\n            Rectangle destinationRectangle,\n            Nullable<Rectangle> sourceRectangle,\n            Color color,\n            float rotation,\n            Vector2 origin,\n            SpriteEffects effect,\n            float depth)\n\nStrange is that after inspecting this method I don't know how the Windows version works!
