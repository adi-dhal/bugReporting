We wouldn't use this or recommend it be used to do runtime processing of content.  This is simply for passing options that are simple runtime choices down thru the ContentManager and down to the various content readers.\n\nFor example it could be used for textures:\n\n```\nvar options = new TextureOptions();\noptions.sRGBFormat = true;\noptions.PreserveSystemCopy = true;\nvar texture = contentManager.Load<Texture2D>(\"myTexture\",options);\n```\n\nsRGB support is simply creating the Texture2D using an sRGB format...  no extra processing is done.  While you could add support into a custom texture processor...  it is sort of overkill for something that is a runtime choice.\n\nThe issues with supporting Texture2D.GetData() on some platforms is easily solved by keeping around the system memory copy of the texture data.  By default the ContentManager throws that away after creating the GPU texture resource.  If for example we kept these around we could use them to implement a fast GetData() on textures.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1996/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1995","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1995/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1995/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1995/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1995","id":19513738,"number":1995,"title":"sRGB Gamma Support","user":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":39689761,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/Design","name":"Design","color":"5319e7","default":false},{"id":27755159,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/DirectX","name":"DirectX","color":"d7e102","default":false},{"id":12913841,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/Feature%20Request","name":"Feature Request","color":"000000","default":false},{"id":27755158,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/OpenGL","name":"OpenGL","color":"02e10c","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":13,"created_at":"2013-09-15T03:32:18Z","updated_at":"2015-02-16T14:29:59Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"We would like to see gamma correct rendering support added to MonoGame.

Works flawlessly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1987/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1986","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1986/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1986/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1986/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1986","id":19255106,"number":1986,"title":"Removed PowerStatus","user":{"login":"KonajuGames","id":694943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/694943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames","html_url":"https://github.com/KonajuGames","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2013-09-10T12:13:48Z","updated_at":"2014-07-11T02:45:29Z","closed_at":"2013-09-10T18:01:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/1986","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1986","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1986.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1986.patch"},"body":"And PowerLineStatus and BatteryCharge files.\nThese were part of XNA 3.0 and removed in 4.0.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1986/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1985","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1985/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1985/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1985/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1985","id":19250935,"number":1985,"title":"NotImplementedException Cleanup","user":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":20,"created_at":"2013-09-10T10:26:47Z","updated_at":"2014-07-11T02:42:55Z","closed_at":"2013-09-11T11:01:40Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/1985","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1985","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1985.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1985.patch"},"body":"This PR is largely cleanup of stub methods that provide no implementation and only throw the `NotImplementedException`.  These methods fool people into thinking that their port works at compile time, only to find exceptions at runtime.  See #1978.\n\nI cleaned up `NotImplementedException`s in two ways:\n- Methods that purely had no implementation on any platform were commented out.\n- Fixed cases where a `NotImplementedException` was incorrectly used to defined an unexpected case in a switch statement.  We use `NotSupportedException` or `ArgumentException` where appropriate.\n\nThere are cases where the unimplemented code is in the middle of a larger statement, I left these alone.  Also places where the `NotImplementedException` occurred in an overridden method were left in as well.\n\nI left the new content pipeline code alone...  it has a lot of `NotImplementedException`s, but it is still in heavy development.\n\nWhile I was at it I implemented a few unimplemented methods that i came across and knew the right fix.\n- GraphicsDeviceManager.BeginDraw()/EndDraw()\n- DisplayModeCollection.GetEnumerator()\n- EffectParameter.GetValueMatrixArray()\n- EffectParameter.GetValueTextureCube()\n- EffectParameter.SetValue(Quaternion)\n- EffectParameter.GetValueQuaternion()\n- AudioCategory.Equals() and related methods.\n\nNone of this changed existing functionality, so it should be safe to merge if all the platforms successfully compile.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1985/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1984","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1984/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1984/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1984/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1984","id":19248644,"number":1984,"title":"Remove
