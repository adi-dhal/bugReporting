It is very expensive to simulate so I have to use GPU instead of CPU. It works fine on MonoGamе for WindowsGL but I need to implement it on mobile devices. \n\nUnfortunately, there is a problem with floating-point textures: they aren’t supported in MonoGame for Android but are heavily used in the simulation. However, in `OpenTK.Graphics.ES20` there are constants like `OesTextureFloat` and `OesTextureHalfFloat` so OpenGL ES 2.0 implementation in OpenTK supports it (I hope). Also I have found that all modern devices support `OES_texture_half_float` and `OES_texture_float` extensions ([OpenGL ES 2.0 Extensions on Android Devices](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3881197/opengl-es-2-0-extensions-on-android-devices)).\n\nThus, I think I can implement this feature in MonoGame (while I have never worked with OpenGL, only with Direct3D). I can start from this commit [Added support for all remaining SurfaceFormat values in OpenGL](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/pull/1686) (thanks @KonajuGames for it).\n\nI ask you to give me some roadmaps, ideas, notes, drafts, potential issues and so on, if you can.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2206/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2205","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2205/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2205/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2205/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2205","id":25875713,"number":2205,"title":"Implemented NormalizedByte4/Byte2","user":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-01-19T06:03:45Z","updated_at":"2014-06-12T15:11:46Z","closed_at":"2014-01-20T22:51:31Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/2205","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2205","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2205.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2205.patch"},"body":"Implementation of NormalizedByte4, NormalizedByte2, and tests to validate it.

However XNA does do finalization which destroys _unmanaged_ resources (like DirectX or OpenGL resources) which is critical to not leaking hardware resources which will not automatically cleanup otherwise.\n\nCurrently it seems we have the finalizer right.  [For example in GraphicsResource](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/Graphics/GraphicsResource.cs#L71):\n\n```\n        ~GraphicsResource()\n        {\n            // Pass false so the managed objects are not released\n            Dispose(false);\n        }\n```\n\nThat comment there is correct.  According to the XNA docs:\n\n>  Finalize invokes Dispose(Boolean) with disposing set to false.\n> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb196223(v=xnagamestudio.31).aspx\n\nSo far so good.  However our `Dispose` methods seem to be wrong... [for example in Texture](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/Graphics/Texture.cs#L180):\n\n```\n        protected override void Dispose(bool disposing)\n        {\n            if (!IsDisposed)\n            {\n#if DIRECTX\n                if (disposing) // WRONG?\n                {\n                    SharpDX.Utilities.Dispose(ref _resourceView);\n                    SharpDX.Utilities.Dispose(ref _texture);\n                }\n#elif OPENGL\n```\n\nHere you can see if `disposing` is false then the DirectX texture Resource or ShaderResourceView are not disposed.  Since these are wrappers around unmanaged hardware resources.... shouldn't we be disposing these when `disposing` is false?\n\nOr is the point here that these wrappers need to be doing their own finalization which correctly frees the hardware resources?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2190","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2190/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2190/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2190/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2190","id":25411460,"number":2190,"title":"SoundEffectInstance Play when Paused doesn't change the State value to Playing","user":{"login":"vchelaru","id":729631,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/729631?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru","html_url":"https://github.com/vchelaru","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2014-01-10T18:02:59Z","updated_at":"2014-04-21T20:48:21Z","closed_at":"2014-04-21T20:48:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I haven't debugged this but I'm running against the public 3.0.1 build and using the following code:\n\n```\n        SoundEffectInstanceFile.Play();\n        if (SoundEffectInstanceFile.State != Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Audio.SoundState.Playing)\n        {\n            throw new Exception(\"Playing a sound doesn't put it in the Playing state\");\n        }\n        SoundEffectInstanceFile.Pause();\n        if (SoundEffectInstanceFile.State != Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Audio.SoundState.Paused)\n        {\n            throw new Exception(\"Pausing a sound doesn't put it in the Paused state\");\n        }\n        SoundEffectInstanceFile.Play();\n        if (SoundEffectInstanceFile.State != Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Audio.SoundState.Playing)\n        {\n            ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n            //////// THIS IS THE ONE THAT FAILS/////\n            ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n            throw new Exception(\"Playing a sound doesn't put it in the Playing state\");\n        }\n```\n\nI'm testing the iOS platform through a remote build so the unit tests are failing reporting this.
