However, this event only fires when characters are typed, **and common function buttons like backspace or delete don't trigger this event**.\r\n\r\nTo provide full functionality to a textbox like UI control, **we currently need to emulate the behavior** by checking the key state in the `Keyboard` class, in an `Update()` loop. However, this emulation is not perfect, because even if implement it to emulate the keyboard delays and repeat speed, if the user hit rapidly the backspace stroke (for example), as the update loop is running, by default, at 60hz, **we may miss some keystrokes**.\r\n\r\n**This gives the end user a laggy experience**. I suggest to implement the `KeyDown` and `KeyUp` events as well (and from what I see in `OpenTKGameWindow`, they're already used, it's just a matter of exposing them) in the `GameWindow` so the user of the framework could have a finer grained control of the keyboard, and would not have to rely on sort of emulation to provide erasing capabilities to a text box.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5805","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5805/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5805/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5805/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5805","id":241718498,"number":5805,"title":"Upgrade to SharpDX 4.0.1","user":{"login":"vpenades","id":5433822,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5433822?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vpenades","html_url":"https://github.com/vpenades","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vpenades/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vpenades/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vpenades/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vpenades/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vpenades/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vpenades/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vpenades/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vpenades/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vpenades/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-07-10T13:49:03Z","updated_at":"2017-09-15T22:48:55Z","closed_at":"2017-07-11T12:02:08Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/5805","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5805","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5805.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5805.patch"},"body":"This is an upgrade of Monogame from SharpDX 2.6.3 to 4.0.1  ... it relies on a fork that includes that SharpDX 4.0.1 assemblies, so the Build/module.xml has been modified to point to the fork","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5805/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5804","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5804/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5804/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5804/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5804","id":241554559,"number":5804,"title":"Improve MGCB","user":{"login":"cra0zy","id":6773302,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6773302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy","html_url":"https://github.com/cra0zy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-07-09T20:34:03Z","updated_at":"2017-10-03T19:55:08Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've been thinking that MGCB could really use some care to make it more easy to deal with, this includes the following list of changes that I would like to make:\r\n -

What I find weird is that `BasicEffect` is just holding one technique, so the loop is only on one element, the technique named `\"BasicEffect\"`.\r\n\r\nAm I missing something, or is it a bug?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5795","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5795/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5795/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5795/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5795","id":238662776,"number":5795,"title":"Fix for OpenGL texture construction not working from a thread","user":{"login":"mrhelmut","id":3427451,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3427451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut","html_url":"https://github.com/mrhelmut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-06-26T20:39:28Z","updated_at":"2017-07-24T07:38:31Z","closed_at":"2017-06-27T03:53:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/5795","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5795","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5795.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5795.patch"},"body":"Hello there,\r\n\r\nThis is a fix for a problem introduced in #5614 which prevented ```Texture2D``` to be loaded from a thread on OpenGL platforms.\r\n\r\n```PlatformConstruct``` needs ```Threading.BlockOnUIThread``` to make sure that no GL operations are done from other threads.\r\n\r\n@KonajuGames @tomspilman ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5795/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5794","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5794/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5794/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5794/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5794","id":238180205,"number":5794,"title":"Monogame.Framework.Portable profile","user":{"login":"impworks","id":604496,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/604496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/impworks","html_url":"https://github.com/impworks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/impworks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/impworks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/impworks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/impworks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/impworks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/impworks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/impworks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/impworks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/impworks/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-06-23T15:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-07-05T10:36:40Z","closed_at":"2017-07-05T10:36:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I can't upgrade my PCL library from MonoGame.Framework.Portable **v3.2.99.1-Beta** to latest **v3.6.0.1625**.

This PR depends on both #5791 and #5792 being merged first.\r\n\r\nThere's some changes in OpenGL platform behaviour with this PR, and one breaking change as outlined below:\r\n\r\n* The OpenGL implementation already captured messages on Debug builds of MonoGame, and emitted them using `System.Diagnostics.Debug`.  I updated the enablement of message capturing to align with DirectX; that is, enabled on Debug builds with the option to be enabled on Release builds by setting `UseDebugLayers` to true. This necessitated moving some code out of `GL`'s static constructor into the PlatformSetup for OpenGL.\r\n* The OpenGL implementation appeared to call a static `OnError` callback in the `GL` class in response to messages being captured.  I've changed the code so this is no longer called, and added an `[Obsolete(..., true)]` attribute which will cause usages of this to emit a compilation error.  It wasn't used in MonoGame itself, and the nature of it's placement in the `GL` class makes it entirely platform specific, so I chose to forcefully deprecate it in favour of `GraphicsDebug`.  This can be changed to a soft deprecation (making the code still call it and changing the Obsolete to a warning) if desired.\r\n* `GraphicsDebugMessage` got some new properties that match the data that OpenGL provides in it's debug messages, since this differs from the kind of information that DirectX provides.  I believe it's better to provide the data in fields that match the underlying subsystem, rather than trying to map things across and losing accuracy in the messages reported.\r\n\r\nTo test that this works, I ran the tests and set a breakpoint on the message capture function:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/504826/27487914-88d244ce-5878-11e7-8400-e8fc98cbfaa7.png)\r\n\r\nIt's not really possible to write an automated test, since different systems may emit different debug messages or not emit messages at all.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5792","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5792/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5792/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5792/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5792","id":238058951,"number":5792,"title":"Refactor
