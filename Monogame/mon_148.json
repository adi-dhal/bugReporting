need to design and implement a method for automating testing of the sound effect and music system in MonoGame.

As a result, our developers are much more productive since they can do more testing in their native development environment with no packaging/publishing delays.\n\nThat being said, we ran into an instance where we needed to test our classes' interaction with GraphicsDevice, but couldn't mock GraphicsDevice because it didn't derive from an abstract or interface type (unlike IGraphicsDeviceManager, etc).\n\nIt would be great if an interface could be extracted and parameterized everywhere (like the Texture2D ctor). Even better would be if Texture2D was itself mockable.\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1555/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1554","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1554/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1554/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1554/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1554","id":12100113,"number":1554,"title":"Added Leaderboard classes to Android project.
