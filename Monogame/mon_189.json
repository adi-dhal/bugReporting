Changes\n  needed to be made in that base class, and it seems unwise to be\n  dependent on the MonoTouch release schedule for new features we may\n  need.\n- Correctly handles rotation (without destroying the GL context)\n- Improves touch and gesture handling\n### GameWindow\n- Cleaned up and implemented as fully as an abstract base class can be\n### GamerServicesComponent\n- Removes a reference to the obsolete property 'Window' on\n  GamerServices.Guide\n### GraphicsDevice\n- Marked some public static members as [Obsolete]\n### SpriteBatch\n- Corrected matrix recalculation when the Viewport changes\n### GraphicsDeviceManager\n- Now calls ApplyChanges in the constructor.\n- ApplyChanges now does (a little) something:  calls\n  GameWindow.SetSupportedOrientations\n### TouchCollection\n- Updated to provide (slightly) better behavior.  Previously touches\n  would accumulate, despite having been processed by a call to\n  TouchPanel.GetState.  This is a little better now.\n### Guide\n- Now discovers the UIWindow it needs via Game.Services.\n### iOSGameWindow\n- Rewritten as a fairly light implementation of GameWindow.\n- This class now merely manages an iOSGameViewController (which manages\n  the iOSGameView)\n### GamePad\n- Updated to use iOSGameView rather than GameWindow\n### VideoPlayer\n- Removed now-unnecessary Pause/Resume hack.\n### iOSGamePlatform\n- Now manages the run loop timer itself and calls Game.Tick to take\n  advantage of the fixed-update-rate code path.\n- Removed orientation handling.  iOSGameViewController now handles most\n  of that.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/347","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/347/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/347/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/347/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/347","id":3473431,"number":347,"title":"RenderTarget
