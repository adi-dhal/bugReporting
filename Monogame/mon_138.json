I've attached a sample program at https://gist.github.com/optimality/6025190.\n\nThis program renders a full-screen quad twice with two different shaders.  The first shader renders a red gradient and a blue gradient to two different render targets.  The second shader takes two input textures and blends them.\n\nThe expected behavior is that there will be a purple gradient on the screen (bluer on the side, redder on the bottom, black in the top left).  The actual behavior is that I get a black screen.\n\nFor diagnosis, I added some other modes:\n- Holding down the \"A\" key will replace the gradients with solid red and blue textures.  They are correctly merged on the screen (it turns purple).\n- Holding down the \"B\" key is supposed to draw the first render target to the screen in the top left.  Nothing happens.\n- Here's the really weird part.  Holding down the \"C\" key draws the second texture to the screen in the top left.  And the background also changes to display the red gradient (but doesn't merge in the blue gradient).  Holding down \"B\" and \"C\" draws both textures to the top left, but doesn't merge them in the background (which continues to only draw one texture).\n\nI can't for the life of me figure out what could be causing this weird behavior.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1868/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1867","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1867/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1867/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1867/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1867","id":16833453,"number":1867,"title":"Disable VSync on DirectX Desktop builds","user":{"login":"RayBatts","id":1228707,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1228707?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts","html_url":"https://github.com/RayBatts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":12,"created_at":"2013-07-16T20:58:56Z","updated_at":"2014-06-12T16:07:52Z","closed_at":"2013-09-06T02:00:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/1867","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1867","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1867.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1867.patch"},"body":"This change allows for vsync to be disabled on DirectX desktop builds.

Instead of one .contentproj with all content build instructions in it... support multiple smaller content command files.\n- Add support for multithreaded content building within the content pipeline

Below is an example of how it could look for the RenderTarget2D class.\n\n```\npublic class RenderTarget2D : Texture2D, IRenderTarget\n{\n#if GLES\n    [DllImport(Platform.LibGLES, EntryPoint = \"glRenderbufferStorageMultisampleIMG\")]\n    private extern static void GLRenderbufferStorageMultisampleIMG(All target, int samples, All internalformat, int width, int height);\n    [DllImport(Platform.LibGLES, EntryPoint = \"glRenderbufferStorageMultisampleEXT\")]\n    private extern static void GLRenderbufferStorageMultisampleEXT(All target, int samples, All internalformat, int width, int height);\n```\n\nI would even recommend to declare the necessary OpenGL enums in place to make it easy for more contributors to understand the code.\n\nMonoGame/XNA is already a wrapper ... it would probably be best for it to directly access the native API instead of relying on another wrapper (OpenTK or whatever comes next).\n\nThe great thing about this is that it is a change that could happen gradually with small and focused pull requests, starting with current missing functionality in MonoGame.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1862","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1862/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1862/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1862/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1862","id":16711798,"number":1862,"title":"WindowsGL
