This test was also not run because it was missing the \"Test\" attribute. \n\nAfter adding it in, the test ran fine in XNA but failed in MG because when Game is disposed the master voice is also disposed and you don't have access to the subvoices after that. I don't think XNA disposes of the master voice when game is disposed because trying to use a SFX after disposing game will work in XNA. The 'fix' in the first commit here is crap, because it doesn't solve anything, but I only just realised that :p \n\nI think Game really shouln't be involved in this to keep things nicely separated. It would be nice if you could run Audio through MG without creating a Game (just using MG as an audio wrapper). So I'd like to expose functions to setup audio (automatically done when creating a game) and dispose of all audio (not called by game) so the user has more control and game disposal doesn't kill all audio (compliant with XNA behaviour).

for an online course with MonoGame, I downloaded the installer for version 3.5.1.1679 of MonoGame.\n\nAt first I thought I could only use Visual Studio 2010 for the assignments, specially because the

option for 2013 was still grayed out, and yes, I ran Visual Studio 2013 at least once before trying.\n\nChecking previous issues like #4612 or #4782, I checked the registry, and I can't see a

Unfortunately I wasn't able to contact the user who reported it (they submitted an invalid e-mail), so I couldn't investigate the cause.\n\nBut I guess the main issue here is not that an exception occurred, but that MonoGame threw a SharpDX exception when trying to create the graphics device. I'm not sure, but I think in this case XNA would likely throw a `NoSuitableGraphicsDeviceException` (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.xna.framework.graphics.nosuitablegraphicsdeviceexception.aspx).

The Shift and Tab keys (which you press to open the overlay) end up getting \"stuck\" in the game. I'm assuming this is because the Steam overlay intercepts all the key events, so MonoGame never sees the \"release\" events for these keys.\n\nI'm having this problem with the WinDX build, but I imagine it also affects other desktop builds. (UPDATE: This actually seems to only affect MonoGame DirectX. Both XNA and MonoGame SDL2 work correctly.)\n\nMy current workaround to this issue is to clear MonoGame's internal key buffer (i.e. `Keyboard._keys`) whenever the Steam overlay is opened or closed. However given this is not publicly exposed, the only way to do this is by changing MonoGame to expose it or by using reflection. I am not sure if this is the best way of dealing with this, but it seems to work well.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this particular problem? And if so, how did you solve it?\n\nAnd if my workaround seems reasonable, would it be acceptable to add this to the MonoGame API (e.g. a `Keyboard.Flush` method which clears the buffer)? If so, I'm more than happy to submit a PR.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5121","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5121/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5121/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5121/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5121","id":171673730,"number":5121,"title":"Improve Texture.GetData and SetData parameter validation","user":{"login":"Jjagg","id":14875382,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/14875382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg","html_url":"https://github.com/Jjagg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":29,"created_at":"2016-08-17T14:33:27Z","updated_at":"2017-01-16T12:16:00Z","closed_at":"2017-01-16T12:16:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/5121","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5121","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5121.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5121.patch"},"body":"This fixes the issues mentioned in #5119 and fixes #1455. Only Texture2D is thoroughly tested for now. I also implemented TextureCube.GetData overloads that were missing.\r\n\r\nSomething that not everyone might agree with is I changed back the validation of elementCount as it was in XNA. We changed this so that when elementCount >= data.Width \\* data.Height the functions worked, while in XNA they check elementCount == data.Width \\* data.Height. I changed this back because I think this is ambiguous. You could argue we're more flexible than XNA if we allow elementCount to be larger, but in fact elementCount itself is not used, so allowing arbitrary values might confuse the user. \r\n\r\nThe fact that elementCount is even in there is a bit weird in the API... It's really only used for validation. Maybe when we start moving away from XNA we can break this by removing it and make it optional for a while (default value of 0 and remove the check) to ease the transition. Or just overload and obsolete the old calls. IMO it makes a lot more sense to have `GetData<T>(T[] data)`, `GetData<T>(Rectangle rect, T[] data)`, `GetData<T>(Rectangle rect, T[] data, int startIndex)` and overloads as needed for mip level, arraySlice etc.\r\n\r\nJust a quick snippet that points out why I think elementCount is misplaced (named params for your convenience):\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar tex = new Texture2D(graphicsDevice: gd, width: 20, height: 1);\r\nvar buffer = new Color[10];\r\ntex.GetData(data: buffer, startIndex: 0, elementCount: 10);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis fails in XNA (and MG) with \r\n\r\n```\r\nSystem.ArgumentException : The size of the data passed in is too large or too small for this resource.\r\n```\r\n\r\nFixes #5172 \r\nFixes #4276","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5121/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5120","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5120/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5120/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5120/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5120","id":171595771,"number":5120,"title":"MGFX preprocessor doesn't like backslash in #includes","user":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":185445795,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/Help%20Wanted","name":"Help Wanted","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/11","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestone/11","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/11/labels","id":1647175,"number":11,"title":"3.7 Release","description":"","creator":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":91,"closed_issues":85,"state":"open","created_at":"2016-03-16T04:39:49Z","updated_at":"2017-10-04T20:19:23Z","due_on":"2017-06-06T07:00:00Z","closed_at":null},"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-08-17T07:52:09Z","updated_at":"2017-03-09T08:23:07Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"If you use a relative path in an FX file include like this:\n\n```\n#include \"..\\platform.fxh\"\n```\n\nThe current preprocessor will pass `..platform.fxh` to the `MGFile.getChildFile(string name)`.\n\nThis seems to be a bug in the preprocessor library that needs to be fixed.\n\nFor now the workaround is to flip the slash:\n\n```\n#include \"../platform.fxh\"\n```\n\nWhich the preprocessor handles fine.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4895","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507242346","x-github-request-id":"ABF7:572D:138DD96:2F809F2:59D6A6B6","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=30>;
