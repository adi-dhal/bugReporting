the Upgrade to OpenTK-1 on android we now have the capability to make use of the RenderOnUIThread support in the AndroidGameView. When set to false the AndroidGameView will NOT create the context on the UI thread but on the background render thread that it uses to do the tick. This has a bonus in that is saves a call to SyncContext.Post to marshal the OnRender call to the UI thread, this can save up to 100ms per tick and is the main cause to the occasional stutter when rendering.\n\nThe problem is at the moment we can't use this property because the Android implementation makes various assumptions about which thread its running on. When RenderOnUIThread is set to false we get allot of Bad Context errors and nothing is rendered.\n\n\"someone\" needs to look into fixing this up ;) (probably me or @danzel (but I have my hands full with Mac Content Pipeline stuff atm …  ))\n\nIn additon, with the latest OpenTK-1 the ability to use multiple contexts is available. This could be used for background loading of textures etc. However there is a caveat, only one context can be active at a time on android, so some kind of locking mechanism will need to be used. Not sure its worth the effort as the current system works quite well. \n\nsee https://github.com/xamarin/monodroid-samples/tree/master/GLSharedContext20\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3221","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3221/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3221/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3221/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3221","id":50712749,"number":3221,"title":"Request for Basic requisite content on install","user":{"login":"willmotil","id":7495196,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7495196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmotil","html_url":"https://github.com/willmotil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmotil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmotil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmotil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmotil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmotil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmotil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmotil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmotil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmotil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-12-02T20:16:22Z","updated_at":"2014-12-02T20:20:47Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"id like to offer a alternate suggestion to #3204 ...

requested / brought up this point for xna 5 but since that never happened i had forgotten about it\n\nin essence : the reasoning to this is that...\nthis would allow a template to have only a couple lines to achieve what is desired\nmy personal desire for this is\ni often use xna monogame for a quick console like test app\n\nfor example:\nthen the template would only add something like this in the load method\nmySpriteFont = DefaultSpriteFont.Load();\nin draw you would then just have\nspritebatch.DrawString(myspritefont,\"hello world\", ect...);\n\nsince xna already has a couple lines to

My WP SDK is apparently broken so I cannot build it.\nIf this is good please post here, otherwise I'll investigate further.\n\n@totallyeviljake has reported another issue on #3202 that I also want to fix related to touch, if this is merged before I get a chance (tomorrow hopefully) please keep #3202 open so I don't forget. Thanks!\n\nFixes #3172\nFixes #3201\nFixes #3202\nFixes #3203\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3205/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3204","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3204/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3204/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3204/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3204","id":50114784,"number":3204,"title":"Improve

Shouldn't require a ton of code or addition source files.\n- Should require little if any content to be built.\n- Should work on all platforms.\n- Should be clear you are looking at MonoGame.\n\nMy
