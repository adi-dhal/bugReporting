GraphicsDevice.GraphicsCapabilities.MaxMultiSampleCount\r\n    : 32;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that in most cases SharpDX will be unable to create the graphics device with `32` multisampling level (BTW, I have NVIDIA GPU, and it seems to work properly only with `8` max multisampling level). And the exception is very cryptic (as usual with SharpDX):\r\n```SharpDXException: HRESULT: [0x80070057], Module: [General], ApiCode: [E_INVALIDARG/Invalid Arguments], Message: The parameter is incorrect.```\r\n\r\nBut that exception is catched by MonoGame and this one thrown instead:\r\n```Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.NoSuitableGraphicsDeviceException: Failed to create graphics device!```\r\n\r\nSo it was a complete mystique to me and required debugging (with using MonoGame source compiled in debug mode) to determine what's going on. Of course I was able to fix this by subscribing to PreparingDeviceSettings and providing proper value to `GraphicsDeviceInformation.PresentationParameters.MultiSampleCount`. But that's not something I wish for other developers to repeat...\r\n\r\nI would prefer to have a proper exception thrown instead of using default `32` value which in most cases will lead to these cryptic exceptions. I know it's not that easy because of current architecture, but we definitely need an improvement in that area.\r\nEven using default value `1` for `MaxMultiSampleCount` will be a better option for now.

I'm currently on the dev branch (3.6.0.1604-develop).\r\n\r\nAlso possibly related, I reimported monogame and now when I try to run my game I get a SDL2 DllNotFoundException.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5523","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5523/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5523/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5523/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5523","id":210870712,"number":5523,"title":"Updated VS 2017 templates so they work","user":{"login":"DDReaper","id":1793042,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1793042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper","html_url":"https://github.com/DDReaper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-02-28T18:35:27Z","updated_at":"2017-03-05T00:06:33Z","closed_at":"2017-03-05T00:06:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/5523","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5523","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5523.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5523.patch"},"body":"Updated VS 2017 templates so they work\r\nInherits old \"compatible\" templates\r\nInherits 2017 Universal 10 VB template\r\n\r\nRef Issue #5515","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5523/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5522","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5522/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5522/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5522/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5522","id":210866990,"number":5522,"title":"Improvements to window handling and full screen switches for desktop","user":{"login":"Jjagg","id":14875382,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/14875382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg","html_url":"https://github.com/Jjagg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-02-28T18:17:18Z","updated_at":"2017-03-13T14:46:26Z","closed_at":"2017-03-13T14:46:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/5522","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5522","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5522.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5522.patch"},"body":"This makes some improvements to how the GameWindow works:\r\n\r\n- Multisampling is supported by the window on initilization. I create a dummy window to create a temporary GraphicsContext to query for multisampling support. I got some weird behaviour though, so would be nice if someone can test that.\r\n- The window position can be set before the native window is instantiated.\r\n- The window title can be set before the native window is instantiated.\r\n- Initializing in full screen mode no longer depends on the internal `applyChanges` method in game. I #iffed out DESKTOPGL for that method so we know it no longer needs it. One step closer to getting rid of it completely.\r\n- Stop listening for SDL Resized event. If it is raised, the SizeChanged event is raised too, so listening to that is sufficient.\r\n- The ClientSizeChanged event is only raised when a user resizes the window (also while resizing, not just when resizing ends but there's no way to distinguish the two with the SDL API), not when it is resized through a back buffer size change.\r\n- The window position is restored after exiting full screen. This is not very stable because SDL raises a bunch of events when entering/exiting full screen and we can't distinguish them from when a user moves the window. Optionally we can check if window position in the event is (0, 0) relative to the current display and assume its a full screen transition and ignore it when it is.\r\n- Window centering now also happens after resizing the backbuffer in stead of just when exiting full screen. This is also not very stable because of the previous issue. Sometimes we detect a window move when\r\nit's because of a full screen switch and afterwards the window will no longer be centered.\r\n\r\nI also added some todo's/comments for more intricate stuff like recreating the window when certain presentation parameters change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5521","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5521/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5521/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5521/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5521","id":210729522,"number":5521,"title":"Support SwapChainPanel on W8.1 / WP8.1 and update templates to use SwapChainPanel","user":{"login":"nkast","id":3018589,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3018589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast","html_url":"https://github.com/nkast","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-02-28T09:20:48Z","updated_at":"2017-09-03T06:26:30Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/5521","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5521","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5521.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5521.patch"},"body":"I found SwapChainBackgroundPanel behaving very unpredictable as I was testing #5520.
