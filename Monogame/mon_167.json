These tiles should have no spaces between them (no gaps) and in XNA they indeed have not. However, in MonoGame they are rendered with (flickering) gaps (especially when the screen is scrolling). Could this be an issue of the (subpixel accuracy) positioning of textures in XNA vs. MonoGame?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1002/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1001","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1001/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1001/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1001/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1001","id":8437594,"number":1001,"title":"Rendertargets are lacking mipmapping functionality","user":{"login":"sthoahmi","id":2818483,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2818483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi","html_url":"https://github.com/sthoahmi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/11","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestone/11","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/11/labels","id":1647175,"number":11,"title":"3.7 Release","description":"","creator":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":91,"closed_issues":85,"state":"open","created_at":"2016-03-16T04:39:49Z","updated_at":"2017-10-04T20:19:23Z","due_on":"2017-06-06T07:00:00Z","closed_at":null},"comments":11,"created_at":"2012-11-17T02:23:46Z","updated_at":"2017-03-09T08:22:53Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Currently, rendertargets do not support the creation of mipmaps. \n\nhttps://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop3d/MonoGame.Framework/Graphics/GraphicsDevice.cs#L1412 \n\nTherefore calls like: \n\nRenderTarget2D r = new RenderTarget2D(graphicsDevice, w, h, mip, SurfaceFormat.Color, DepthFormat.None);

This is because I keep getting errors that crash the game.\n\n For example: I've done what is necessary to port the game to Mac OS X. When I try to run the game, I keep getting an error that crashes the game. The errors that occur (multiple errors; I comment out lines that give errors to see what other errors occur) seem to all have to do with drawing a string or just loading a SpriteFont. I think that the reason the game works on Android and iOS is because I didn't draw any strings in those versions (I did the scoring differently, and don't have a HUD in the game).\n\nI've been trying to find a way around this problem for a long time now (I don't mean just a few hours, I mean days worth of total time).

This certainly makes sense given XNA's history of supporting Mouse on Windows, and Touch on Windows Phone, with no real platform that would have both.\n\nThat is, until now, with Windows 8.  Apps/Games on Windows Store are required to support both Mouse and Touch inputs.  Windows has made it easy to support both by normalizing input down into the \"Pointer\" concept.  This is pervasive in the Windows platforms (XAML, C++, and Web - where Microsoft is pushing Pointer input as a W3C standard).  You can  read about that unified standard here:  http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/09/24/towards-interoperable-pointer-events-evolving-input-events-for-multiple-devices.aspx\n\nGiven that Win8 apps need to support both, and that there is an existing way of treating them both the same (Pointer) and that many Windows Phone ports will already be wired up to XNA TouchPanel, I think it makes sense to allow the TouchPanel to process Mouse as a virtual touch point.\n\nSince both mouse and touch input comes into MonoGame as Windows Pointer events, this seems very easy to wire up.\n\nIn fact, I think it is just a matter of resolving out this filtering in InputEvents.cs:\n\n``` C#\nvar isTouch = pointerPoint.PointerDevice.PointerDeviceType == PointerDeviceType.Touch;\nif (isTouch)\n    TouchPanel.AddEvent((int)pointerPoint.PointerId, TouchLocationState.Pressed, pos);\nelse\n{\n    // Mouse or stylus event.\n    UpdateMouse(pointerPoint);\n```\n\nIn my own experimenting, simply setting isTouch = true allows my mouse to work as a touch point.  Since Gestures are driven by these touch locations, gestures also now work with the mouse.\n\nThis allows me to continue coding my game to TouchPanel, and Mouse will be interpreted as another touch point (with PointerID=1 in windows).\n\nObviously, real mouse input would stil need to be supported.  There could be a new mode where mouse is treated as touch only (no mouse events), or a mode where mouse is ALSO treated as touch (and still maintains mouse events).  Windows and Internet Explorer always treat mouse as pointer, and maintain the \"legacy\" mouse events in parallel (so for mouse movements you get both the mouse events and pointer events).\n\nAny thoughts on this?  I'm going to implement support for this in the FourBros fork because we need it to port Taptitude to Windows 8 (Taptitude is a Windows Phone game currently and has no knowledge of Mouse).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4757","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507242346","x-github-request-id":"BCFB:572B:D3EB69:1C0051D:59D6A988","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=168>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=200>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=166>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"ecdfe9cad0a60fc439ab8046b500a190\"","status":"200 OK"}}
