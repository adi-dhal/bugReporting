I found a post on the SharpDX forums discussing this issue (http://sharpdx.org/forum/5-api-usage/3334-xaudio2-unable-to-load-dll-xaudio2-8-dll). Long story short - It seems you need to use the DirectX11 SharpDX libraries for Windows 7. The DirectX11.1/11.2 libraries don't seem to be fully supported under Windows 7.\n\nI did a quick hack to prove this by copying the SharpDX 2.6.3 DirectX11 libraries in. I also had to revert the changes made to SoundEffect.XAudio.cs after I did this to get it compiling. Sound effects started working again with these changes.\n\nI'm more than happy to make a pull request for this. But I wasn't sure whether to use the SharpDX \"DirectX11-net40\" or the \"DirectX11-Signed-net40\" libraries though...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4044","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4044/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4044/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4044/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4044","id":98739130,"number":4044,"title":"Correct fix for MediaFactory.GetService failure","user":{"login":"MichaelDePiazzi","id":5249498,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5249498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi","html_url":"https://github.com/MichaelDePiazzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-08-03T13:08:11Z","updated_at":"2015-08-17T02:05:07Z","closed_at":"2015-08-13T08:38:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/4044","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4044","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4044.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4044.patch"},"body":"This should be the correct fix for the MediaFactory.GetService failure and related volume problems\\* in the Windows DirectX build (See PR #3255 / Issue #2620). This PR may possibly also resolve issue #1954.\n\n(\\* I was having a problem where after the first song was played, volume changes were not taking effect until the next song was started)\n\nThe problem is that GetService cannot be called until the session topology is ready. According to the SharpDX documentation (http://sharpdx.org/documentation/api/m-sharpdx-mediafoundation-mediasession-settopology), when the session is currently paused or stopped, the MediaSession.SetTopology method doesn't even take effect until the next call to Start. And because the method is asynchronous, you need to wait until you receive a \"SessionTopologySet\" event anyway to know that it's completed.\n\nSo I've changed the code to listen for this event. I've tested this on Windows 7 64-bit and it seems to work as expected now (i.e. no crashes on GetService, and volume changes take effect immediately).\n\nPS. A similar fix will also likely be required for VideoPlayer.WMS as it uses the same methods, but I wanted to focus on MediaPlayer first as this is what I was having issues with and could test.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4043","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4043/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4043/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4043/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4043","id":98733542,"number":4043,"title":"[Win Pipeline] Fixed argument passing","user":{"login":"cra0zy","id":6773302,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6773302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy","html_url":"https://github.com/cra0zy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-08-03T12:30:02Z","updated_at":"2015-08-09T20:21:10Z","closed_at":"2015-08-09T19:51:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/4043","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4043","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4043.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4043.patch"},"body":"Fixes #3230, credit to @nkast for the fix\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4043/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4042","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4042/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4042/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4042/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4042","id":98563383,"number":4042,"title":"Strange texture edge bleeding when upgrading a year old game to MonoGame","user":{"login":"hach-que","id":504826,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/504826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que","html_url":"https://github.com/hach-que","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-08-01T21:52:52Z","updated_at":"2017-02-06T08:15:25Z","closed_at":"2017-02-06T08:15:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm getting this strange texture edge bleeding effect after upgrading a year old game to the latest version of MonoGame:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/504826/9023721/19c6ff60-38eb-11e5-93fd-3b1f85a37923.png)\n\nI used to do:\n\n```\nthis.GraphicsDevice.SamplerStates[0].Filter = TextureFilter.Point;\n```\n\nin LoadContent, but that is no longer permitted, so I changed it to:\n\n```\nthis.GraphicsDevice.SamplerStates[0] = SamplerState.PointClamp;\n```\n\nand started performing this before rendering all of the textures.
