But that doesn't concern non-pooled instances.\n\nWhat do you guys think about this? ( @tomspilman @KonajuGames ?) Should all pooled and non-pooled instances of a given `SoundEffect` be stopped? Or do one consider that non-pooled instances (via `SoundEffect.CreateInstance`) life-cycle is up to the developer?\n\nLet me know what you think and if I should push that fix or rework it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4092","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4092/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4092/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4092/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4092","id":101851454,"number":4092,"title":"Add Windows 8.1 project generation to Protobuild definitions.","user":{"login":"kjpou1","id":640466,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/640466?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjpou1","html_url":"https://github.com/kjpou1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjpou1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjpou1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjpou1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjpou1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjpou1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjpou1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjpou1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjpou1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjpou1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2015-08-19T09:51:15Z","updated_at":"2017-03-13T08:16:38Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/4092","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4092","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4092.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4092.patch"},"body":"This will create project and solutions for Windows 8.1 version of MonoGame so that it can be loaded in Visual Studio 2015.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4092/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4091","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4091/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4091/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4091/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4091","id":101735939,"number":4091,"title":"UAP issue (Update Required)","user":{"login":"HeshamMeneisi","id":10683997,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10683997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeshamMeneisi","html_url":"https://github.com/HeshamMeneisi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeshamMeneisi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeshamMeneisi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeshamMeneisi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeshamMeneisi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeshamMeneisi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeshamMeneisi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeshamMeneisi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeshamMeneisi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeshamMeneisi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2015-08-18T19:54:11Z","updated_at":"2015-08-19T23:13:16Z","closed_at":"2015-08-19T23:13:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Altough the SDK is installed and I can create and run a UAP normally, the MonoGame UAP project just cannot recognize the SDK and the solution doesn't load showing a message (Update required).\n\n![uap](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10683997/9340990/79697050-45f3-11e5-926f-a307f6d8c06a.PNG)\n\nEDIT: I have acquired VS 2015 Enterprise from Dreamspark and it's fully featured, all features are installed except for the Win10 emulator.

When it did happen, the song would start playing but then stop very shortly after.\n- On my Win10 laptop, the problem was much easier to reproduce. Basically I'd play a song, stop it, play another song, stop it, and then play the first song again (which would then not start playing at all).\n\nI believe issues #1954 and #3884 are related (and likely will be resolved by this PR and/or my previous PR #4044).\n\nThis was quite a pain to resolve (I spent the past 2 days working on it)... Eventually it mostly came down to cross threading issues, not waiting for asynchronous methods to complete when required, and unnecessary/incorrect use of some MediaSession functions.\n\nAnyway, it should hopefully be a lot cleaner and more robust now. I have not been able to reproduce the issues I was having, so I believe they're resolved now.\n\nVideoPlayer.WMS will most likely need similar fixes (since it uses the same APIs), but I don't have anything that uses it and can't afford the time to investigate further. If there are similar issues though, hopefully someone else can just look at what I've done here to resolve them.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4089","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4089/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4089/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4089/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4089","id":101622609,"number":4089,"title":"Remove

I noticed that it works fine with the first Song played after app launch, but any subsequent song played can't have their volume changed (with the exception of `MediaPlayer.Volume = 0.0f` which correctly totally mutes the song).\n\nPlatform: WinDX.\n\nPossible related issues: #3884\n\nEDIT: it seems to be a problem with the `MediaSession` and `MediaFactory.GetService(session, MediaServiceKeys.StreamVolume, AudioStreamVolumeGuid, out volumeObj);`. If I force the recreation of a new `MediaSession` at each play, it works. So it looks like there is a problem with retrieving the correct `AudioStreamVolume` for the given song stream. Most probably related to the fact that topology updates are async (and therefore still bound to the previous stream somehow when trying to retriever the stream volume controller).\n\nMost XAudio2 media session impletations seem to re-create a session at every play because media session updates are async. So if you guys are OK with that, I can submit a PR that Shutdown media sessions upon stop and start a fresh one upon start.\n\nIt is also because of those async initialisations that getting the audio stream volume controller may fail (and needs to wait). I can clean that up and init it once the topology is correctly set (you can know that with the MediaEvent callback).\n\nLet me know if that sound coherent.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4072/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4071","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4071/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4071/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4071/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4071","id":100429107,"number":4071,"title":"Mini
