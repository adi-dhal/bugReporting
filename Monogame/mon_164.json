Whilst this occurs the user is presented with a black screen and the music playing. This leads to confusion about whether the game may have crashed. Also, when adding full screen ads to a game, these generally cause the GL context to be lost so when the user dismisses the ad, they are hit with this lengthy texture reload each time.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1092","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1092/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1092/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1092/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1092","id":9354753,"number":1092,"title":"Very strange crash","user":{"login":"sthoahmi","id":2818483,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2818483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi","html_url":"https://github.com/sthoahmi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2012-12-18T01:28:39Z","updated_at":"2013-01-13T13:06:00Z","closed_at":"2013-01-13T13:06:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I just noticed a strange crash of my game that is likely to be connected with MonoGame (earlier versions of the Visual Studio (VS) of the game without MonoGame do not crash).

In our game, I tested out switching these precisions to mediump and lowp respectively and noticed about a 5-7FPS increase in our menus and a 2-3FPS increase ingame. This obviously isn't the major performance gain we've been looking for, but it could be a step in the correct direction.\n\nWhat's everybody's opinion about defaulting to a lower precision? According to the GLES Shading Language reference...\n\nhighp - 16-bit, floating point range: -2^62 to 2^62, integer range: -2^16 to 2^16\nmediump - 10 bit, floating point range: -2^14 to 2^14, integer range: -2^10 to 2^10\nlowp - 8 bit, floating point range: -2 to 2, integer range: -2^8 to 2^8\n\nI ran a lot of performance tests through Instruments and saw that most of the time our Device and Renderer utilization is very high while our Tiler utilization is very low. This suggests that the processing of pixels could be our bottleneck. We could possibly see an even bigger win if we default to lower precision, and specify all color variables with the lowp hint. Most of our pixel shaders are pretty simple, but there's no need to use a 16bit variable when we could easily get away using half of that.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1089","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1089/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1089/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1089/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1089","id":9344437,"number":1089,"title":"MonoGame Template is not showing up in VS 2012 in windows 7","user":{"login":"FantasyVI","id":3065887,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3065887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FantasyVI","html_url":"https://github.com/FantasyVI","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FantasyVI/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FantasyVI/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FantasyVI/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FantasyVI/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FantasyVI/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FantasyVI/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FantasyVI/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FantasyVI/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FantasyVI/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2012-12-17T19:26:28Z","updated_at":"2015-02-11T11:46:32Z","closed_at":"2015-02-11T11:46:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The MonoGame template is not showing up in VS 2012.

LayoutSubviews destroys and recreates our framebuffer as the view's recalculated, but destroying the FBO when we present a modal view only leads to crashes as we yank the FBO from under the graphics device.\n\nTest:\nRemove the PreserveFrameBuffer bool from iOSGameView and all references to it.\nStart the app/game up.\nUse something like Guide.BeginShowKeyboardInput().\nApp will either crash or throw a GL exception.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1082/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1081","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1081/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1081/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1081/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1081","id":9273630,"number":1081,"title":"iOS Orientation Fix","user":{"login":"RayBatts","id":1228707,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1228707?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts","html_url":"https://github.com/RayBatts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":17,"created_at":"2012-12-14T01:40:04Z","updated_at":"2014-06-13T07:58:21Z","closed_at":"2013-01-26T07:11:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/1081","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1081","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1081.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1081.patch"},"body":"Luckily, not too much changed to fix this.\n\nCreateFramebuffer() was determining the orientation of the screen by which orientations were supported, rather than the orientation the device was currently in.

encountered performance issues in Rum Run on our DirectX platforms, Windows 8 and WP8.\nWe have a menu and a game screen next to each other, windows phone style. The menu is drawn from textures, the gamescreen is a rendertarget of the paused game plus buttons drawn on the sceen (it's black because rendertarget doesn't work on WP8 yet).\nThe game runs at smooth 60 fps on all devices we worked with (even first gen WP7s), but on Windows RT and WP8, the transition between the two screens is really choppy (480p textures were used everywhere for testing). My best guess is that it may be related to the background of the pause menu being a rendertarget that we draw on the screen using SpriteBatch.\n\nSee this video:\nhttp://youtu.be/oPfXKpm5fhM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1072/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1071","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1071/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1071/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1071/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1071","id":9250833,"number":1071,"title":"AccessViolationException when closing program","user":{"login":"xanather","id":3013922,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3013922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xanather","html_url":"https://github.com/xanather","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xanather/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xanather/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xanather/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xanather/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xanather/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xanather/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xanather/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xanather/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xanather/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2012-12-13T12:45:52Z","updated_at":"2013-01-15T13:16:00Z","closed_at":"2013-01-15T13:16:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In the ShaderProgramCache class I receive a AccessViolationException when closing the program (either by clicking Stop Debugging in VS2012 or by clicking close on the actual game window).\n\nThe exception is thrown at line 54.\n\n```\n    public void Clear()\n    {\n        foreach (var pair in _programCache)\n        {\n            if (GL.IsProgram(pair.Value.program)) <-- here\n            {\n```\n# if MONOMAC\n\n```\n                GL.DeleteProgram(pair.Value.program, null);\n```\n# else\n\n```\n                GL.DeleteProgram(pair.Value.program);\n```\n# endif\n\n```\n                GraphicsExtensions.CheckGLError();\n            }\n        }\n        _programCache.Clear();\n    }\n```\n\nI think I posted this issue codeplex but I will post it here aswell.\n\nFunny thing is, its random.
