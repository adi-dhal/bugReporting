The tool looks like this:\n\n![pipeline](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/103522/2826714/104909b8-cf76-11e3-8045-b49b7210165f.png)\n\nIt currently has the following basic features which makes it usable immediately:\n- Loading, saving, and creating new pipeline project files.\n- Adding and removing existing content to the project.\n- Change importers and processors as well as its properties.\n- Build, rebuild, and clean content.\n- No dependence on Microsoft XNA or Visual Studio.\n\nIt was built using C# and WinForms specifically for Windows support.  We have a simplified MVC design intended to allow someone to eventually implement a new IView for MacOS and Linux.\n\nOur next steps here are to get feedback from users, iterate on the core features, and improve the functionality.  A few things on our roadmap for the tool:\n- Editing custom processor assembly lists.\n- System for per-platform content/settings.\n- Support for linked content files.\n- Better property editors.\n- Undo/redo stack.\n- Actual help docs.\n- Recent file lists.\n- Proper unloading of processor assemblies.\n- Adding tool to MG installer and registering file extensions.\n- Triggering .mgcb building directly from Visual Studio build.\n- Import existing .contentproj files.\n\nThanks to @jamesford42 for making all the treeview and property grid work correctly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2440","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2440/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2440/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2440/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2440","id":32380946,"number":2440,"title":"Process hold gestures even if no gesture events are occurring.","user":{"login":"jbeshir","id":528031,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/528031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbeshir","html_url":"https://github.com/jbeshir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbeshir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbeshir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbeshir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbeshir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbeshir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbeshir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbeshir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbeshir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbeshir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2014-04-28T17:37:14Z","updated_at":"2014-06-14T00:42:01Z","closed_at":"2014-06-14T00:41:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/2440","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2440","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2440.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2440.patch"},"body":"This PR fixes a problem wherein hold gestures are not recognised promptly, or sometimes at all.\n\nCurrently, new gestures are only checked for when _gestureEvents is non-empty. However, Android at least does not add to _gestureEvents while a touch location stays still, and it seems plausible that other platforms behave similarly.\n\nThis causes a hold gesture to not be recognised unless and until the user moves the touch location (at least slightly) at some point after the appropriate time has passed. If the hold is released without moving, the hold gesture is not processed at all. As a result, the hold gesture is unreliable unless the user deliberately waits, then performs a small motion to trigger it.\n\nThis commit causes gestures to be processed unconditionally of whether any new gesture events were received, allowing the hold gesture to be recognised and processed properly after the passage of the appropriate amount of time.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2440/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2439","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2439/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2439/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2439/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2439","id":32375104,"number":2439,"title":"Cocos2DXNA

We change their namespace to be within `MonoGame.Utilities` and make sure API feels sufficiently C# like and common possibly passing a `Stream` to them directly.  We need to make sure the only things public are the external API to use the library.  We will keep all the original author comments and license info for attribution of the original work.\n\nWe would then use these helpers across all platforms removing all platform specific PNG/JPG code within MonoGame.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2424/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2423","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2423/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2423/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2423/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2423","id":32242576,"number":2423,"title":"Add missing parameters to platform methods on Texture3D","user":{"login":"JamesLupiani","id":916042,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/916042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesLupiani","html_url":"https://github.com/JamesLupiani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesLupiani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesLupiani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesLupiani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesLupiani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesLupiani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesLupiani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesLupiani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesLupiani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesLupiani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-04-25T15:38:06Z","updated_at":"2014-07-10T22:35:15Z","closed_at":"2014-04-25T19:38:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/2423","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2423","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2423.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2423.patch"},"body":"A few little--but important--things here:\n- Some of the parameters were left out in the API split, but it turns out we did need them.\n- Moved the interop marshalling into the platform files to keep alloc/free near the resource usage and consistent with the others.\n- Renamed member variables to follow the underscore prefix convention.
