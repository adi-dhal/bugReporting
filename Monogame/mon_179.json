there,\na) This implements IsMouseVisible for Windows/Linux. However, this code only works with the SVN version of OpenTK and not with the version that is currently used by MonoGame. I would really recommend updating.

I've tried to reuse as much code as possible. XNB decompressing has been refactored so it can be used when loading and reloading assets.\n- Support for reading into existing instances added to Texture2D, SpriteFont, Model ContentTypeReader classes. I've taken the view that we only need to update the graphics resources and discard anything else when an existingInstance is supplied.\n- Effect does not get reloaded through the ContentManager. Instead it caches the glsl code and recompiles that. Only glsl support added for now\n- Added triggering of DeviceReset events to allow other GPU assets to be reloaded or recreated. Not sure if it's the best spot to trigger from, but it seems as good as any given current state of things.

This lead to platforms like iOS eventually running out of GPU memory as SpriteFont textures were never released.  We can now run for over 24 hours without running out of memory on iOS.\n\nThe second is a fix which makes iOS compile again (a bug that has been there for a week or so).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/622","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/622/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/622/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/622/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/622","id":5834614,"number":622,"title":"IsMouseVisible on Linux","user":{"login":"BlanketFortGames","id":2041590,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2041590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlanketFortGames","html_url":"https://github.com/BlanketFortGames","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlanketFortGames/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlanketFortGames/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlanketFortGames/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlanketFortGames/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlanketFortGames/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlanketFortGames/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlanketFortGames/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlanketFortGames/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlanketFortGames/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2012-07-25T16:48:21Z","updated_at":"2012-08-12T13:28:10Z","closed_at":"2012-08-12T13:28:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This setting seems to have no effect on linux.

Now that MonoGame does resolution changes on the display, I've noticed that this doesn't work on linux because OpenTK talks to RandR/X in the wrong way.\nFIxing it isn't too hard, but I'm not sure how I should go about this in MonoGame.\nShould I write a workaround in MonoGame? Or should I try to get it in OpenTK as soon as possible and run my game with a custom OpenTK version (which means that nobody else using MonoGame would get the fix)? Or should I try to get it into OpenTK and MonoGame will then use an unstable OpenTK version?\n\nEDIT: Also: How should MonoGame handle multiple screens? Most games simply change the resolution on the primary screen and don't care about anything else, which results in a disabled second screen and a bad resolution on the primary screen. Most games then fail to set this back to normal when they exit (on Linux, that is. On Windows this is different). Should I add code to MonoGame to do this stuff correctly and also handle multiple screens in a \"smart\" way?\nOf course, it would also be possible to use a different (i.e. unstable) version of OpenTK for Linux and keep the old version on Windows.\n\nEDIT again: I just checked again: The bug is already fixed in the latest OpenTK svn version. So what to do? Use that on Linux? or backport the change? Personally, I'd prefere using the latest OpenTK svn version as there were many bug fixes for Linux in the last 1-2 years...\n\nEDIT once again: A newer OpenTK version could also help implementing new features such as IsMouseVisible...\nThanks,\nAdrian\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/620","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/620/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/620/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/620/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/620","id":5807627,"number":620,"title":"Incrementing touch Id for Android.","user":{"login":"Aranda","id":1129912,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1129912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aranda","html_url":"https://github.com/Aranda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aranda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aranda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aranda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aranda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aranda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aranda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aranda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aranda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aranda/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2012-07-24T16:57:59Z","updated_at":"2014-07-11T03:58:47Z","closed_at":"2012-07-25T18:30:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/620","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/620","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/620.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/620.patch"},"body":"- Added Android/Input/Touch/AndroidTouchEventManager.cs and refactored MotionEvent handling to this class\n- Removed GestureListener.cs and references\n- Fixed bug in TouchPanel.cs where all subsequent events with the same Id (instead of same Id and state) were removed.\n- Avoided crash when tapping during initial app load.
