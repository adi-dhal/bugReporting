Now i am porting it to Android and I'm struggling with an issue for a couple of weeks now. Hoping that someone can help me.\n\nFirst of all both songs and soundeffects/soundeffect instances seem to work when I'm testing on an emulator. When I try it on my acer b1-730hd (Acer Iconia One7) tablet, a strange issue occurs that soundeffects stop working when I start my game. from the main screen which plays an introduction song.\n\nI use Mediaplayer to play mp3 background songs. While playing the game xnb/wav files are used as sound effects.\n\nSo when the game starts, a song is being played. When going to the settings screen to adjust sfx volume, you can hear the soundeffect on increasing/decreasing the volume. Then I go back to the main screen. From that point when I either go in game or back to the settings screen, the sound effects are completely gone and only the background music remains. It seems that calling the MediaPlayer.Play() for the second time introduces this issue for me.\n\nIn the meanwhile I've tried to downgrade/upgrade to newer versions of monogame, but none seem to fix the issue.\n\nIf someone knows what is going on or how to fix it, please let me know.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3586/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3585","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3585/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3585/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3585/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3585","id":59476379,"number":3585,"title":"New

Now I managed to find the root of it. Here it is:\n\nCreate a rendertarget in LoadContent, and recreate it if ClientSizeChanged occurs. Also load a couple of textures.\n\n``` C#\n        protected override void LoadContent()\n        {\n            base.LoadContent();\n\n            this.renderTarget = new RenderTarget2D(this.GraphicsDevice, this.GraphicsDevice.Viewport.Width, this.GraphicsDevice.Viewport.Height);\n            this.Window.ClientSizeChanged += (sender, e) =>\n                {\n                    this.renderTarget.Dispose();\n                    this.renderTarget = new RenderTarget2D(this.GraphicsDevice, this.GraphicsDevice.Viewport.Width, this.GraphicsDevice.Viewport.Height);\n                };\n\n            // Also load a couple of textures\n        }\n```\n\nComment out this line so orientation changes will trigger ClientSizeChanged :\nhttps://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/893ee3522f67c6725f99ccf2bde5cf33b1276d10/MonoGame.Framework/Android/AndroidGameWindow.cs#L185\nOr use builds prior to https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/pull/3560\n\nTurn the screen of the phone on/off -> Rendertarget is sequentially created with already used ID\nRotate phone -> Rendertarget is sequentially created
