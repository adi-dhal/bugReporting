Many people I've talked to assume that MonoGame is meant to replace XNA, as XNA is no longer in development, but I get the impression MonoGame is actually dependent on XNA.\n\nThe [Getting Started](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/wiki/Tutorials%3Agettingstarted) tutorial says that XNA is required:\n\n```\nTo develop on a Windows box you will need at a minimum\n\n    * Visual Studio 2010 Express or Above or MonoDevelop/Xamarin Studio\n    * XNA 4.0 Game Studio\n    * Windows Phone 7 SDK\n    * OpenAL installed.\n\nThere is a requirement for XNA Game studio to allow you to compile content into .xnb format, this can be done using the Windows Phone SDK's but if you are using or plan to use custom shaders you will need the XNA tool chain as the Windows Phone SDK's do not support shaders. \n```\n\nHowever [Windows Prerequisites](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/wiki/Tutorials%3Aprerequisites) doesn't list XNA:\n\n```\n1. Install Mono: http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page\n    i. Click the \"Download\" link\n    ii. Select your operating system under \"Long-term Supported Version\"\n    iii. Select the specific download. On Windows, select \"Mono for Windows, Gtk#, and XSP\"\n2. Install OpenTK: http://www.opentk.com/\n3. Install MonoDevelop 2.8+: http://monodevelop.com/\n    i. The website for MonoDevelop will mention that you need GTK. If you installed Mono, you will have GTK\n    ii. If you are installing the Windows binary confirm that you have .NET 4.0 and GTK# for .NET 2.12.10 mentioned here: http://monodevelop.com/Download\n4. Install msysgit (this must be done before installing TortoiseGit on Windows): http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/\n    i. You will want to download the \"Net installer\" or \"Full installer\" for msysgit. For example, \"msysGit-fullinstall-1.7.4-preview20110204.exe\"\n5. Install TortoiseGit: http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/\n```\n\nSo can I use MonoGame instead of XNA, or is XNA required?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2310/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2309","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2309/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2309/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2309/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2309","id":30448399,"number":2309,"title":"Cannot build MonoGame source on Xaramin for Mac","user":{"login":"DanB91","id":1284373,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1284373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanB91","html_url":"https://github.com/DanB91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanB91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanB91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanB91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanB91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanB91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanB91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanB91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanB91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanB91/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2014-03-29T17:38:01Z","updated_at":"2017-05-02T20:59:04Z","closed_at":"2017-05-02T20:59:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I am trying to set up MonoGame on my Mac.  \nI am running:\n- OS X 10.9.2\n- Xaramin 4.2.3\n- MonoMac MDK 3.2.7\n- MonoMac MRE 3.2.7\n\nI want to set up MonoGame on my Mac so I start on a project.  However, when I try to run a test project from the MonoGame template, the application just bounces in the dock forever.\nThus, I found on the internet a convoluted process of setting up MonoGame on Mac located here: https://monogame.codeplex.com/discussions/471565\n\nNow I have it another road block.  When I try to build the MonoGame source to generate the needed .dlls, I get 3 build errors (and 67 warnings, but I am not sure if those are intended).\n\nThe 3 build errors are: \n- /Users/danb91/Downloads/MonoGame-3.0.1.0/MonoGame.Framework/Graphics/Texture2D.cs(27,27): Error CS1502: The best overloaded method match for 'MonoMac.AppKit.NSImage.AsCGImage(ref System.Drawing.RectangleF, MonoMac.AppKit.NSGraphicsContext, MonoMac.Foundation.NSDictionary)' has some invalid arguments (CS1502) (MonoGame.Framework.MacOS)  for line 623: `var cgImage = nsImage.AsCGImage (RectangleF.Empty, null, null);`\n- /Users/danb91/Downloads/MonoGame-3.0.1.0/MonoGame.Framework/Graphics/Texture2D.cs(49,49): Error CS1620: Argument '#1' is missing 'ref' modifier (CS1620) (MonoGame.Framework.MacOS) for line 623: `var cgImage = nsImage.AsCGImage (RectangleF.Empty, null, null);`\n- /Users/danb91/Downloads/MonoGame-3.0.1.0/MonoGame.Framework/Graphics/Texture2D.cs(17,17): Error CS0411: The type arguments for method 'Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.Texture2D.SetData<T>(T[])' cannot be inferred from the usage. Try specifying the type arguments explicitly (CS0411) (MonoGame.Framework.MacOS) for line 641: `texture.SetData(data);`\n\nHow do I get past these compilation errors?  Am I missing some sort of dependency?    Instead of compiling the MonoGame source, is there someplace I can just get the prebuilt dll's for Mac?\n\nAlso: Why aren't the proper dll's included with the .mpack?  Are there no Mac build servers?  Is there anything I can do to help?\n\nPlease excuse any ignorant questions.
