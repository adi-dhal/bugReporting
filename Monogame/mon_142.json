I believe the problem occurs under the MacOSX build. \n\nThe program produces a series of RenderTarget2Ds featuring text drawn using SpriteFont. These render targets are then drawn onto the backbuffer (with each subsequent render target being vertically offset from the previous). The first render target drawn to displays as expected but subsequent render targets are missing text, instead displaying empty boxes rather than the expected glyphs.\n\nSwitching the font being used by DrawString will lead to the next render target to be drawn to correctly but any following attempts with that font will fail, unless you switch to drawing with another font first.\n\n(the red text can be ignored, they're just two strings drawn to the backbuffer, one before the render targets are drawn and one after.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1758/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1757","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1757/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1757/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1757/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1757","id":14831002,"number":1757,"title":"Moved the 'WINDOWS || WINRT' endif that was preventing the graphics device from being created","user":{"login":"klutch","id":567254,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/567254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klutch","html_url":"https://github.com/klutch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klutch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klutch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klutch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klutch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klutch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klutch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klutch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klutch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klutch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2013-05-28T09:29:52Z","updated_at":"2014-07-11T03:21:34Z","closed_at":"2013-05-28T15:47:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/1757","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1757","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1757.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1757.patch"},"body":"Explained in issue #1756\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1757/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1756","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1756/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1756/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1756/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1756","id":14830842,"number":1756,"title":"Initialize() in GraphicsDeviceManager doesn't create a GraphicsDevice instance on Windows","user":{"login":"klutch","id":567254,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/567254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klutch","html_url":"https://github.com/klutch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klutch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klutch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klutch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klutch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klutch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klutch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klutch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klutch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klutch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2013-05-28T09:25:41Z","updated_at":"2013-05-28T17:15:49Z","closed_at":"2013-05-28T16:13:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The latest merge of pull request #1751 prevents the following code inside Initialize() from ever happening on Windows:\n\n```\n// TODO: Implement multisampling (aka anti-alising) for all platforms!\n            if (PreparingDeviceSettings != null)\n            {\n                GraphicsDeviceInformation gdi = new GraphicsDeviceInformation();\n                gdi.GraphicsProfile = GraphicsProfile;

like a month ago we submitted a PR to expose the ability to create more than one GameWindow in a Game.\n\nhttps://github.com/mono/MonoGame/pull/1465\n\nWhile this is all working rendering wise just fine...  we now have to deal with input handling.  In particular there are two problem areas:\n1. TouchPanel\n2. Mouse.GetState()\n\nWith both they share the same problem...  touch positions and mouse positions are both relative to the window origin.  Since we have multiple windows...   who is to say what GameWindow the touch/mouse is in?\n\nThe first solution I was thinking about is something like this:\n\n```\nvar touchState1 = TouchPanel.GetState(); // The primary Game.Window\nvar touchState2 = SecondGameWindow.TouchPanel.GetState();\n```\n\nThe idea being GameWindow would have a getter to access the correct TouchPanel state for each window.  The global `TouchPanel.GetState()` would be unchanged...  it would just always be the state from the primary GameWindow.\n\nNow I don't know if that exactly fits with mouse input.  The same technique could work:\n\n```\nvar mouseState1 = Mouse.GetState(); // The primary Game.Window\nvar mouseState2 = SecondGameWindow.Mouse.GetState();\n```\n\nJust not sure what happens when the mouse is not actively in one of the windows.  I guess the same as if the mouse is outside of the primary GameWindow in a single window game?\n\nAnyway...  I've put up this issue to solicit ideas before we submit a PR to add the functionality.  Please give us feedback!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1731/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1730","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1730/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1730/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1730/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1730","id":14315425,"number":1730,"title":"Add DebuggerHidden attribute to CheckGLError","user":{"login":"KonajuGames","id":694943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/694943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames","html_url":"https://github.com/KonajuGames","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2013-05-14T15:26:57Z","updated_at":"2014-07-11T04:21:40Z","closed_at":"2013-05-15T14:56:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/1730","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1730","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1730.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1730.patch"},"body":"The DebuggerHidden attribute makes the debugger break at the caller of CheckGLError if an exception is thrown, not inside CheckGLError.
