The problem is, I know very little about the inner workings of the framework and I doubt I would be able to help with any of the coding issues.\r\n\r\nOne area I probably _could_ help is in documentation. Before I start submitting PRs for documentation changes out of nowhere, though, I want to discuss it so that I don't end up wasting my time or anyone else's. I apologize if this is the wrong place to bring it up (since this isn't exactly an issue with MonoGame, but rather _contributing_ to MonoGame).\r\n\r\nA few things that might be problematic to me helping with documentation:\r\n\r\n- My level of understanding of MonoGame is much more that of an end-user than a contributor. In other words, I'm familiar with the API, but not the implementation.\r\n- I'm a Windows user only, and almost all of my experience with MonoGame is with working on desktop DirectX projects. I'm unfamiliar with UWP and I'm still using Windows 8.1, and I haven't really tried using OpenGL seriously.\r\n- My knowledge is mostly limited to 2D game development.\r\n- I've never actually published a video game, but I have been working on projects off and on for two years.\r\n\r\nWith all those caveats, should I even bother? I do think I have enough knowledge to at least contribute a little.\r\n\r\nFor documentation guidelines, I've seen #2520, which is somewhat old and it was never really confirmed in that discussion what the final outline would be. There's also the README in the documentation folder, but that just has a TODO under the style guide for manuals, guides, and tutorials.\r\n\r\nIf I could help with documentation, any guidance on how to get started would be appreciated.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5749/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5748","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5748/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5748/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5748/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5748","id":232865498,"number":5748,"title":"Use SharpDX NuGet packages from our NuGet packages","user":{"login":"DDReaper","id":1793042,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1793042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper","html_url":"https://github.com/DDReaper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/11","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestone/11","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/11/labels","id":1647175,"number":11,"title":"3.7 Release","description":"","creator":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":91,"closed_issues":85,"state":"open","created_at":"2016-03-16T04:39:49Z","updated_at":"2017-10-04T20:19:23Z","due_on":"2017-06-06T07:00:00Z","closed_at":null},"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-06-01T12:39:17Z","updated_at":"2017-06-02T16:59:51Z","closed_at":"2017-06-02T16:12:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/5748","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5748","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5748.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5748.patch"},"body":"The NuGet's now inherit SharpDX direct from NuGet instead of including the dll's directly.\r\n\r\nOf note, I had to use the Version 3.0.0 packages (same as what MonoGame uses now), anything higher and it simply didn't work.

This should ensure we support all the languages that matter for game localization.\r\n\r\nUnder the hood each platform would provide its own implementation to fetch the active OS language.\r\n\r\nWe could even go beyond just a single enum and instead return a immutable `GameLanguage` type that has additional helpers

created a new MonoGame.Windows (SharpDx) project,  loaded \"blast_mono.wav\" into a SounfEffect, and when trying to play the sound, I only get silence.\r\n\r\nSame example in WindowsGL works correctly.\r\n\r\nAfter some research, I found that SharpDX.XAudio2 [constructor](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/Audio/SoundEffect.XAudio.cs#L119) was throwing an exception with the following message:\r\n\r\n`HRESULT: [0x80040154], Module: [Unknown], ApiCode: [Unknown/Unknown], Message: Unregistered Class`\r\n\r\nI tried to find a solution using the SharpDX currently used by monogame without success.\r\n\r\nThen I followed the next steps:\r\n\r\nI upgraded MonoGame.Framework.Windows to SharpDx 4.0\r\nUpon compiling it gave 3 or 4 errors very easy to fix (RawBool instead of Bool and a missing argument in Reberb)\r\nAfter compiling and running again, it gives more initialization exceptions, but this time in the [MasteringVoice](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/Audio/SoundEffect.XAudio.cs#L134) , apparently, it doesn't like being passed a deviceID = 0\r\nI removed the last three arguments, and left the constructor as `new MasteringVoice(Device);`\r\n\r\nCompiled again, and it worked!, sound was playing!\r\n\r\nSo in order to fix the problem, it's a matter of upgrading to SharpDX 4.0  and adjusting the MasteringVoice constructor.\r\n\r\nBtw, I tried removing deviceId argument from MasteringVolume with SharpDX 2.6.3 but it didn't work. Given that SharpDX 4.0 is a significant milestone and it seems there's no big hurdles upgrading monogame to SharpDX, I would ask to consider upgrading

is a global DopplerScale (`SoundEffect.DopplerScale`) that is implemented in MG, but `AudioEmitter.DopplerScale` is unused for both XAudio and OpenAL. We need to investigate exactly how XNA applies this scale (most likely just multiply it with the global scale) and fix both paths.\r\n\r\nThe XAudio fix is straightforward because XAudio emitters have their own DopplerScale. Assuming XNA multiplies the Doppler scales, we just need to remove [this line](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/Audio/SoundEffectInstance.XAudio.cs#L42) and multiply the emitter DopplerScale with SoundEffect.DopplerScale [here](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/Audio/SoundEffectInstance.XAudio.cs#L116). It looks like assigning the DopplerScale was accidentally put inside that #if block. It should be moved out so it is applied for UWP too. \r\n\r\nFor OpenAL we need to do some more experimenting. There is only a global Doppler scale in OpenAL, no emitter-specific setting. We need to test if sound effects keep the doppler scale they get when they start playing or if changing the scale affects playing sounds too (that's not in the docs). If playing sounds are affected when changing the global Doppler scale, we can't replicate XAudio behaviour and we should just use `SoundEffect.DopplerScale`, ignoring the emitter settings.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5740/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5739","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5739/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5739/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5739/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5739","id":231836602,"number":5739,"title":"[OpenAL] SoundEffectInstance settings not applied when not playing","user":{"login":"Jjagg","id":14875382,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/14875382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg","html_url":"https://github.com/Jjagg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-05-28T00:15:31Z","updated_at":"2017-05-28T16:32:55Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Under OpenAL SoundEffectInstance instances only get a source assigned when they are playing (a source is the native resource for playing a sound in OpenAL).

That means settings are only applied when the sound is playing or paused. An example of what intuitively should work, but does not is the following:\r\n```\r\nvar instance = sfx.CreateInstance();\r\ninstance.Pitch = pitch;\r\ninstance.Play();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's some comments about OpenAL [limiting the number of sources](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/Audio/OpenALSoundController.cs#L78), but I don't think that's still relevant with OpenAL soft.

both projects instead of the platform specific one and MonoGame.Framework is not present anymore.\r\n\r\nThis means the only way of sharing code in a game targeting different platforms is to use a
