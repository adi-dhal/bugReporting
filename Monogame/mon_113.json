PR adds the initial skeleton of the various IntermediateSerializer classes as described from the XNA docs.  The implementation does not work yet.\n\nI'm also starting to port over the work @JamesLupiani  did in the XmlImporter (see https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/pull/2380) which basically implements what the IntermediateSerializer classes need to do.\n\nEventually we should be able to replace the current `XmlImporter` implementation with a single call to `IntermediateSerializer.Deserialize()`.  This is in fact how i'm testing that this works.\n\nMy next step is to implement the overloaded `ContentTypeSerializer` which is what seems to drive the entire XML serialization process.  This looks like a very similar design to how the `ContentTypeWriter`/`ContentTypeReader` system works.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2620","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2620/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2620/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2620/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2620","id":34269302,"number":2620,"title":"Music doesn't play correctly on Windows 7 (DirectX)","user":{"login":"DissidentDan","id":7416047,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7416047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DissidentDan","html_url":"https://github.com/DissidentDan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DissidentDan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DissidentDan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DissidentDan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DissidentDan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DissidentDan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DissidentDan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DissidentDan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DissidentDan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DissidentDan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":19,"created_at":"2014-05-25T17:54:24Z","updated_at":"2014-12-16T02:03:23Z","closed_at":"2014-12-11T18:51:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi, When I go to play an wma/xnb song WITHOUT the Visual Studio debugger attached, the first time I play a song, it does not play.

up, \nthis should make the differences a lot more clear now.\nthe first thing you should note is just how many WH variables there are and were you can get them from the test itself will let you see how they all relate to each other\n\nXna Test 06   **test description...**\n1) this has a automated test by default so it will step thru the same commands in order\nafter which you can use the (F 1 thru 12 keys) to repeat the tests\n2) to manually test from the start set the run_test_script boolean member variable to false \nor just wait for the test to finish\n3) this is a xna Game1 app test with the _console turned on_ in the project properties\n(**in the the monogame test version 3 methods are missing so i commented those lines out**)\n4) commands recorded into the console output shown with the at symbol \nand the results shown of the various values after each\n5) _the standalone game1 test code i used to perform it is shown at the bottom of my posted text file_\n6) i had sycronize with vertical retrace commented out i must have un-commented it prolly want to comment that out though\n\nThis is shown below results of my test of Xna 4.0's Behavior Including a mode

not in monogame\nnote that 1200 width is not a valid mode width in my test yet there was no failure to set fullscreen\nit overrided my bad value as long as just one parameter was right\nagain also note i didn't test resizing by window borders you can do that as well in this test\ninputs of F1, F2 are basically in windowed mode no call to full screen is made with them.\nnote there are two different ways to call fullscreen in xna 4.0 shown in the test\nPressing F9 in fullscreen you will visibly see the mode change or flash to a new

This is the normal way.\n\nBoot up the run loop yourself in Platform.BeforeRun and return false. (Only Android does this)\n\nI think we could (and should) change android over to use the normal way of doing this, it'll make the Game run loop code have one less hack.\n\nCurrently on Android Game.BeforeRun is never called due to this custom behaviour. Android also has to manually keep track of if Game has been initialized to call DoInitialize.\n\nOne change I am planning to do as part of this is to change GamePlatform.BeforeRun to be void rather than returning bool. I don't see any platform other than Android that returns false here, so AFAIK this should be okay.\n\nTo hack-fix this on your local copy, copy `_gameTimer = Stopwatch.StartNew();` up to the start of Platform.Run(GameRunBehavior) like:\n\n``` c#\nif (!Platform.BeforeRun())\n{\n    _gameTimer = Stopwatch.StartNew();\n    return;\n}\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2615/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2614","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2614/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2614/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2614/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2614","id":34239422,"number":2614,"title":"Fixed

previous method for calculating if we were running slowly was to time a whole frame (including Present time). If this is >= TargetElapsedTime then we decided we were running slowly.\nUnfortunately this can be basically all of the time as Present waits for vsync (hardware/driver dependent).\n\nI've made a test project to see how IsRunningSlowly behaves in XNA. It seems that when the game does many Update calls before a Draw call this triggers IsRunningSlowly to become true.\nIt only becomes unset after a few times of just doing a single Update per Draw call.\n\nI've implemented this in MonoGame, the results don't exactly match XNA, but they are very close. We only set IsRunningSlowly at the same times as them, we unset it a bit sooner however.\n\nThe 5 used for triggering IsRunningSlowly I arbitrarily chose.\n\nFixes #2595 (Contains good discussion on the issue)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2606","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2606/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2606/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2606/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2606","id":34161335,"number":2606,"title":"Fix burst of Game.Update calls at the start of the game","user":{"login":"danzel","id":393086,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/393086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danzel","html_url":"https://github.com/danzel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danzel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danzel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danzel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danzel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danzel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danzel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danzel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danzel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danzel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-05-23T10:06:09Z","updated_at":"2014-06-17T15:28:04Z","closed_at":"2014-05-23T14:42:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/2606","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2606","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2606.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2606.patch"},"body":"Found while investigating #2595\nTest project: https://github.com/danzel/DrawTextTest/tree/isrunningslowlytest\n\nWe start the Game._gameTimer Stopwatch when the Game class is constructed.
