Blank App\n- Add function to MainPage.xaml.cs\n  \n  ```\n  void renderingFunc (object sender,object args)\n  {\n      renderingCount++;\n  }\n  ```\n- Add CompositionTarget.Rendering+=renderingFunc; to the MainPage constructor.\n- Add a button to the XAML and a textblock in order to print stuff. Associate this function to the button\n  \n  ```\n  private void Button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n  {\n      textBlock.Text=String.Format (\"Rendering calls: {0}\",renderingCount);\n  }\n  ```\n- Run on WP8.1 device (mine is Nokia 920 , latest firmware update).Tapping the button will print the number of times Rendering has been called\n- Now mash the screen with all fingers, tapping and dragging. Admitely it takes some more time than MonoGame to crash, but I can make it crash in 10-15 seconds\n- Now tap the button. Tap no longer works.\n\nOK, now the weird part. I was writing this message to show the evilness of CompositionTarget.Rendering, affecting touch, adding a huge delay to screen rotation, increasing global warming and in WP10 I think it's the culprit that sometimes randomly the touch locations are 'portrait' when should be 'landscape'.  When I thought... this is weird, I can't see why subscribing to CompositionTarget can affect this.\n\nSo, at the previous message I removed everything related to CompositionTarget, and incremented the counter each time the button was pushed. Guess what? WP8.1 still stops receiving touches.\n\nSo, creating a simple XAML app, adding a button, and mashing, makes the button (and all touch) stop working in my Nokia 920.\n\nSo, my question is... is it just an issue with my Nokia 920 or is somebody else able to reproduce this problem? Because it seems that everything with XAML in it is freezing when mashing the screen in WP8.1 mode (not a problem in WP8.0) \n\nEDIT: I've seen several WP8.1 only games freezing under those conditions, and apparently not using MonoGame at all, which would confirm that everything-XAML based on my Nokia 920 is affected by this problem.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4128","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4128/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4128/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4128/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4128","id":105566511,"number":4128,"title":"Update Protobuild","user":{"login":"hach-que","id":504826,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/504826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que","html_url":"https://github.com/hach-que","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":38,"created_at":"2015-09-09T10:12:06Z","updated_at":"2015-11-08T13:43:40Z","closed_at":"2015-11-08T11:13:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/4128","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4128","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4128.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4128.patch"},"body":"This updates Protobuild for #3405.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4127","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4127/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4127/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4127/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4127","id":105374778,"number":4127,"title":"Adding VB.Net Project Templates during setup","user":{"login":"beppe9000","id":6625123,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6625123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beppe9000","html_url":"https://github.com/beppe9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beppe9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beppe9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beppe9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beppe9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beppe9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beppe9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beppe9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beppe9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beppe9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-09-08T12:56:09Z","updated_at":"2015-09-08T12:56:09Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Many people would appreciate the presence of Vb.Net Project Templates for MonoGame, at least for the Desktop targets.

WMV video played would leak about 75MB of memory, rapidly increasing the amount used by the software, with disposing the videos doing nothing, even after PlatformDispose was uncommented in Video.cs.\n\nI spent a while looking into it and came to the conclusion that the cleanup process wasn't being handled correctly; MediaFoundation documentation at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms703190(v=vs.85).aspx describes an asynchronous process of closing the session that needs to be done before the media source, then session is disposed. I couldn't find any documentation for disposing media sources without closing the session they had been used with.\n\nI came up with a first draft for a set of changes to fix this, using #4090's work on MediaPlayer as a starting point, which move the MediaSession into the Video class and have a MediaSession per video, which is closed, followed by disposal of the rest of the resources, when the video is disposed. They also dispose events received by our callback class, since not doing so causes the leak to persist, which is something that likely wants to be incorporated in any fixes to MediaPlayer's disposing of resources, too. The changes are at https://github.com/jbeshir/MonoGame/tree/video-player-rework but this isn't suitable to merge because of some remaining issues I encountered while working on it:\n- The TaskScheduler-based dispatching to the UI thread used in #4090 didn't seem to be working right for me, it was running things on the thread pool, so I had to incorporate the same approach to passing tasks off to the UI thread used on Android. I suspect this could have been caused in some fashion by the particular product I was testing with, though.\n- Because it needs to invoke to the UI thread several times to raise events before the video enters the playing state after a call to PlatformPlay, the loop waiting for the session to enter the playing state in Play always fails. I'm not sure the best way to deal with this, but this might not be a problem if the above is fixed since it sleeps in Play and .NET pumps the message queue while sleeping/blocked on a lock by default.\n\n(In our own fork I worked around this by adding a PlayAsync method to VideoPlayer.cs, which dropped the loop-and-sleep-until-state-changed behaviour entirely, since it was desirable to make things smoother anyway by letting the rest of the program continue while the video setup happened, but this didn't fix the XNA compatible API and I've not included it in the linked branch.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4121/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4120","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4120/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4120/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4120/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4120","id":104470920,"number":4120,"title":"GamePad not working on Windows 7 / DirectX","user":{"login":"mrhelmut","id":3427451,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3427451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut","html_url":"https://github.com/mrhelmut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-09-02T12:34:51Z","updated_at":"2015-09-17T00:19:08Z","closed_at":"2015-09-17T00:19:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey there,\n\nWe are testing our game against several configurations and it appears that gamepads are no more working on Windows 7 and Vista (DirectX target).\n\nThey are correctly installed but are not detected in MonoGame.

use the actual Monogame with SharpDX 2.6.3 and my App has a problem with the resolution of 1920x1080. When i tap to the right bottom corner i receive a position nearly to (1280,720) in a 720p-Emulator, which is correct. In a (800x480)-Emulator i receive for the same tap a position  nearly to (800,480), which is correct. In a 1080p-Emulator i receive for the same tap a position nearly to (1280,720), which is wrong.
