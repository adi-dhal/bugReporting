The problem is that SoundEffect expands to full PCM data in memory, regardless of the originating file type. This is fine for SoundEffect because those are limited in XNA to .wav files, but bad for songs which can be compressed.\n\nAs an example, in my game, MonoGame was expanding my relatively tame 5.6MB .mp3 file into roughly 50MB in memory! This will obviously get worse the larger the file you have.\n\nI do have a fix for this that simply reverts to using the monotouch AVAudioPlayer just for Songs, but I don't know enough about the design and future plans of MonoGame's audio subsystem to know if that is the right fix.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/506/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/505","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/505/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/505/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/505/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/505","id":4956774,"number":505,"title":"Update
