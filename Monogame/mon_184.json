Touch event logic is all moved to TouchPanel as well with each platform just needing to forward raw press/move/release events to TouchPanel.AddEvent().\n\niOS and WinRT both use the gesture code... someone needs to remove the Android OS gestures for these.\n## Tick Refactor\n\nThe Game.Tick() code has been refactored to work correctly for fixed updates, support draw suppression, and use the more accurate Stopwatch for timing.  It is also simpler to read and understand.  GameTime has been fixed to be correct to XNA4 api.\n## SpriteFont Optimization\n\nThe use of ThreadStatic and the unnecessary abstractions in SpriteFont have been removed reducing the CPU overhead and moving a bunch of unnecessary calculations.  It shaved at least a 40% performance improvement from one benchmark.

This would give us a small file so package and load from disk, but we would quickly decompress them at load time to a PCM for playback via OpenAL.\n\nUnfortunately it seems MonoTouch/iOS cannot decompress an MP3 and return the raw PCM data to us.  We would have to include a 3rd-party library to do that which isn't something we want to do at the moment.\n\nThe good news is this work will eventually help on Android where from what we understand can use mp3 sound effects natively.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/472/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/471","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/471/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/471/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/471/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/471","id":4689117,"number":471,"title":"Update ClientBounds and PresentationParameters.Bounds on window resize (Desktop)","user":{"login":"marshallward","id":462315,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/462315?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marshallward","html_url":"https://github.com/marshallward","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marshallward/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marshallward/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marshallward/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marshallward/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marshallward/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marshallward/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marshallward/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marshallward/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marshallward/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2012-05-22T12:11:03Z","updated_at":"2014-06-13T04:05:36Z","closed_at":"2012-05-23T20:04:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/471","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/471","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/471.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/471.patch"},"body":"This patch updates the major window bound parameters (ClientBounds, Viewport, PresentationParameters) on window resizing.
