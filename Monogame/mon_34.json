As instructed, the project and model work fine on for a MacOS project. When using the same model (same code too) for an iOS version, the build fails of the project fails. The structure I am using is a shared project that has the common game code and game assets (the model) in the .mgcb file. There are two other projects in the solution, one for the MacOS version and the other for an iOS version that both reference the shared project and hence include the shared .mgcb. I am using XS 5.10.3 with MonoGame 3.5.1. When building from the Pipeline GUI, there is no error. When building from XS, the build fails saying the MGCB.exe command exited with code:1. Copying that command and running it in Terminal while in the Content directory of the shared project, yields the following error:\n\n```\n/usr/local/bin/mono \"/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/External/xbuild/MonoGame/v3.0/Tools/MGCB.exe\" /@:\"/Users/ksuda/Documents/My Xarmarin Projects/TestMono/TestMonoCommon/Content/CommonContent.mgcb\" /platform:iOS /outputDir:\"/Users/ksuda/Documents/My Xarmarin Projects/TestMono/TestMonoIOS/Content/bin/iOS\" /intermediateDir:\"/Users/ksuda/Documents/My Xarmarin Projects/TestMono/TestMonoIOS/Content/obj/iOS\" /quiet\nSkipping /Users/ksuda/Documents/My Xarmarin Projects/TestMono/TestMonoCommon/Content/fpsFont.spritefont\n/Users/ksuda/Documents/My Xarmarin Projects/TestMono/TestMonoCommon/Content/MonoCube.dae\n    /Users/ksuda/Documents/My Xarmarin Projects/TestMono/TestMonoCommon/Content/MonoCubeTexture.png\n        Could not convert texture.

If you add the .png as the tutorial describes, you get an additional message embedded before the above exception:\n`Warning: Asset MonoCubeTexture.png built multiple times with different settings.`\nI realize that .png files are not supported on iOS, but I would think that if I had a shared model that included a texture, that the texture would be converted automatically as appropriate. If I change the .mgcb to only include the texture, it does convert file but the model is not there of course. I would expect whatever settings the .png gets converted to for building on iOS, should also apply to .png (or any texture) when building a model that includes the texture. I further tried a .fbx with the texture embedded, but got different problem (separate issue).\n\nAttached is the MonoCube.zip from the tutorial. I repeated the same steps for creating and exporting the model from Blender as described in a related tutorial to the one above (newer version of Blender than used in tutorial) and get the same error.\n\n[MonoCube.zip](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/files/352610/MonoCube.zip)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4994/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4993","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4993/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4993/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4993/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4993","id":164315135,"number":4993,"title":"Fix issues with modifying presentation parameters with multisampling enabled","user":{"login":"hach-que","id":504826,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/504826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que","html_url":"https://github.com/hach-que","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-07-07T13:57:21Z","updated_at":"2017-02-27T03:05:02Z","closed_at":"2016-09-20T15:33:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/4993","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4993","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4993.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4993.patch"},"body":"When you enable multisampling at game startup, it determines the maximum multisampling count allowed by the hardware and configured both the swap chain and depth stencil view with it.\n\nHowever, when you `ApplyChanges` at runtime, it had a hard-coded value of 4 if multisampling was enabled.  Due to this, if you modified the presentation parameters (in my specific case it was enabling window resizing), it would cause the multisampling count of the swap chain (now 4) and the multisampling count of the depth stencil view (still 16 in my case) to get out of sync, which is not permitted in DirectX.  The end result of this was that instead of rendering working correctly, the window would be entirely black, with nothing rendered.\n\nThis moved the maximum multisampling count logic into a platform-specific method on the `GraphicsDevice`, and ensures that method is called whenever the multisampling count needs to be adjusted by MonoGame.\n\nIt also addresses a scenario where a `RenderTarget` could be created with a different multisampling count on the depth stencil view than the underlying texture resource.  This update texture to keep track of the sample description used when creating the resource, and forces the logic to use the same parameters when creating the depth stencil view, to avoid the same scenario occurring on render targets as was occurring on the swap chain.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4992","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4992/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4992/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4992/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4992","id":164230475,"number":4992,"title":"Refactor ShaderProfile to allow for pipeline extensibility","user":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/9","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestone/9","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/9/labels","id":1441958,"number":9,"title":"3.6 Release","description":"More unit tests, running unit tests on Mac and Linux, SDL2 replacing OpenTK.","creator":{"login":"dellis1972","id":810617,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/810617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972","html_url":"https://github.com/dellis1972","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":148,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-12-03T11:17:13Z","updated_at":"2017-08-21T16:42:53Z","due_on":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2017-03-09T08:22:27Z"},"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-07-07T05:08:49Z","updated_at":"2016-07-08T12:50:21Z","closed_at":"2016-07-08T12:50:21Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/4992","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4992","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4992.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4992.patch"},"body":"This PR is the first baby step towards making the content pipeline more easily extendable for new platforms.\n\nHere I refactored the existing `enum ShaderProfile` into a class that knows how to perform various platform specific steps of the effect compiling process.\n\nThis also introduces a helper class `LoadedTypeCollection<T>` which scans loaded assemblies for types of a particular base class.

Monogame calles itself the _spiritual successor to XNA_ and not _a Mono-compatible re-implementation of XNA_, I was wondering if there any plans to move away from the current API design  to get Monogame ready for future requirements, improve components etc., essentially making it XNA-incompatible?\n\nAmongst the things which are annoying me since the early days of XNA (and now Monogame) for example is the `Game` class, the _two-step-initialization_ paradigm and the references to `Game` all over the place. It's just bad design. Also that many components which would be helpful to re-create an own, better main `Game` class are internal (e.g. `GamePlatform`).\n\nTake this for example:\n\n```\npublic class MyGame : Game {\n    public MyGame() {\n        var graphics = new GraphicsDeviceManager(this);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhat happens here? The `GraphicsDeviceManager` takes the current `Game` instance as a parameter which is essentially used to register itself in the game service collection of the game, only to be retrieved in a service-locating manner later from the `Game`. This makes it not only impossible to properly test the `GraphicsDeviceManager`, it also isn't really obvious that the game requires an instance of the type (otherwise it crashes). Not very nice.\n\nI know it's not you guys fault, it's just how XNA was designed. Hence I'm asking - are there any plans to drop the design alltogether in favor of modern standards, extensibility and more cleaner seperation of components?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4984/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4983","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4983/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4983/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4983/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4983","id":163939504,"number":4983,"title":"Can't create new Windows 10 UWP app","user":{"login":"JranZu","id":3099474,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3099474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JranZu","html_url":"https://github.com/JranZu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JranZu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JranZu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JranZu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JranZu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JranZu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JranZu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JranZu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JranZu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JranZu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":185445795,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/Help%20Wanted","name":"Help Wanted","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/9","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestone/9","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/9/labels","id":1441958,"number":9,"title":"3.6 Release","description":"More unit tests, running unit tests on Mac and Linux, SDL2 replacing OpenTK.","creator":{"login":"dellis1972","id":810617,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/810617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972","html_url":"https://github.com/dellis1972","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":148,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-12-03T11:17:13Z","updated_at":"2017-08-21T16:42:53Z","due_on":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2017-03-09T08:22:27Z"},"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-07-05T20:29:37Z","updated_at":"2017-01-29T18:37:22Z","closed_at":"2016-07-31T23:48:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Similar issue to: https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/issues/4435 however uninstalling & reinstalling the Universal Windows App Development Tools did NOT solved the issue.

This works all fine as long as I have only a single monitor enabled. However when I enable a second one, the resolution of the first one gets set while the actual game is rendered on the second monitor in borderless windowed mode.\n\nHere's a screenshot to clarify what's happening:\n\n![wtf](https://i.imgur.com/aVHGePO.png)\n\nThe code to setup the fullscreen:\n\n```\n_graphics.CreateDevice();\n_graphics.IsFullScreen                                    = _gameSettings.IsFullScreen;\n_graphics.SynchronizeWithVerticalRetrace     = _gameSettings.EnableVerticalSync;\n_graphics.PreferredBackBufferWidth              = _gameSettings.Resolution.Width;\n_graphics.PreferredBackBufferHeight             = _gameSettings.Resolution.Height;\n_graphics.ApplyChanges();\n```\n\nThis is invoked in the `Initialize()` method right before the call to `.base.Initialize()`, however I've tried various different combinations (e.g. initializing the `GraphicsDeviceManager` in the .ctor, with or without calling `GraphicsDeviceManager.ApplyChanges();` etc.)\n\nIs this a known problem? Does fullscreen even work on that platform?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4973/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4972","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4972/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4972/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4972/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4972","id":162904786,"number":4972,"title":"Threading
