and all,\n\nWhile debugging \"Terraria linux port\" to find out why sound suddenly stops playing, I just found that each time one creates a new SoundInstance, a new Sound object is created too, even when we could reuse an already created sound object available on the SoundEffect class.\n\nI took the liberty to edit those classes and commit to my fork(they are not restricted to Linux solution, so I think it could affect everyone). Thus I can comment on the github commit page to explain why I think this change could fix the caching issue.\n\nThis change solved the Terraria port issue. Sound does not stops suddenly any more. Besides, I believe this could reduce the memory needed to play sounds and improve sound performance (allocating a new sound means reading a sound file from disc sometimes). One guy was complaining about sound lag on iOS some weeks ago on irc, I think this could be related.\n\nI see that when you create a new sound instance, you have to set volume, pitch (and so) prior playing. There may be an issue (at least with openAL) that if two instances from a same sound are played at the same time with two different volume values, both will be played with the last volume value set. I'll try to solve it latter, as a solution isn't popping in my mind right now.\n\nCould someone, please, take a look and see if my changes won't break the project?\n\nThank you.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/33/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/32","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/32/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/32/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/32/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/32","id":1423238,"number":32,"title":"Removed
