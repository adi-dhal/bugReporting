#4592.\nThis is the simplest fix for the problem, convert the bitmap to 32 bits and continue from there.\nFuture bitmaps that are not contemplated in the special cases are treated as bitmaps, and converted to 32 bits bitmaps.\nI have tried to preserve the higher color resolution of the original image, but `PixelBitmapContent.TryGetFormat` can't handle that option at this time, and this exposed a bug in `PixelBitmapContent.SetPixelData` it ignores the return value of `TryGetFormat`, using the default value.\n\nIn game test of the texture, it is a bit cropped at bottom because the window ended there\n![ingametex](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11319966/13477629/a357d026-e0cd-11e5-8215-df5ae4fc30fa.PNG)\n\nThis can be merged now, or I can try to enable the RGBA64 format

can't test this in other arch at the moment. But using full quality on Pipeline doesn't work to create a ogg file (libvorbis).\n\nAs far as I could tell, this is the default call to ffmpeg on Mac:\n\n```\nffmpeg -y -i input.mp3 -vn -c:a libvorbis -b:a 192000 -f:a ogg -strict experimental output.ogg\n```\n\nI kept trying to find a suitable bitrate, and the higher i could find was 180k\n\n```\nffmpeg -y -i input.mp3 -vn -c:a libvorbis -b:a 180000 -f:a ogg -strict experimental output.ogg\n```\n\nSo, probably better to check if this happens with othr versions, and probably adapt `QualityToBitRate` function to return different values accordingly with encoder. Even not being able to compile, I can try to create a patch.\n\nUsing the .xnb file generated when creating a Mac m4a, and the .ogg file created above, I still get\n\n```\nFailed to get buffer bits: Invalid Value, format=Stereo16, size=0, sampleRate=22050\n```\n\nLet me know how/if I can help debugging this.\nBest,\nAlberto\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4588/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4587","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4587/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4587/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4587/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4587","id":137586255,"number":4587,"title":"Add Vector3.TransformCoord","user":{"login":"KonajuGames","id":694943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/694943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames","html_url":"https://github.com/KonajuGames","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":185445795,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/Help%20Wanted","name":"Help Wanted","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2016-03-01T14:23:52Z","updated_at":"2016-11-17T23:47:37Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Add Vector3.TransformCoord that does the same as XMVector3TransformCoord by mapping the result back to w = 1.
