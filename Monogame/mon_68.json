far I understand, right now, if you want to use an FX in your game, then it has to go through the Content Pipeline, which will preprocess all macroses according to the Processor's Defines settings.\nSuch behavior is problematic if you have many defines in your FX code(which is often true for 3d engines), as you have to make an effect for every possible defines' set.\nTherefore I propose to add the Effect compilation API to the framework.\nRoughly speaking, I mean the addition of the function that takes FX code as input and produces the Effect bytecode as result.\nLike following:\n\n``` c#\nbyte[] simpleEffectByteCode = EffectUtils.Compile(Resources.MyShader, string.Empty);\nEffect simpleEffect = new Effect(device, simpleEffectByteCode);\nbyte[] lightningEffectByteCode = EffectUtils.Compile(Resources.MyShader, \"LIGHT=1\");\nEffect lightningEffect = new Effect(device, lightningEffectByteCode);\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3978","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3978/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3978/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3978/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3978","id":92743738,"number":3978,"title":"FX

It looks like mipmap is not generated...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3972/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3971","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3971/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3971/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3971/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3971","id":91781186,"number":3971,"title":"Clean up hanging references","user":{"login":"KonajuGames","id":694943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/694943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames","html_url":"https://github.com/KonajuGames","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-06-29T11:42:01Z","updated_at":"2015-06-29T23:54:57Z","closed_at":"2015-06-29T23:54:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/3971","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3971","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3971.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3971.patch"},"body":"This PR fixes up some hanging references held by static fields after Game.Exit was called.\n\nGit normalized some inconsistent line endings on commit.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3971/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3970","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3970/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3970/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3970/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3970","id":91734515,"number":3970,"title":"[ContentPipeline] Ignore Identity bone","user":{"login":"nkast","id":3018589,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3018589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast","html_url":"https://github.com/nkast","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2015-06-29T08:21:04Z","updated_at":"2016-04-04T11:03:56Z","closed_at":"2016-04-04T11:03:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/3970","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3970","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3970.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3970.patch"},"body":"Animations usually have a ROOT/PIVOT bone.

We have a WinForm application where you can start a XNA/Monogame where we have an animation that just illustrate a flow. \n\nXNA implementation:\nWhen the animation was done we exit the application pressing 'Esc' and two code of lines was used:\nthis.Dispose()\nthis.Exit()\n\nMonogame implementation:\nI can't use same implementation as for XNA since the line \"this.Dispose()\" make it crash later.\nI only use \"this.Exit()\". The game is started from an using statement: \nusing (Demo d = new Demo())\n    d.Run()\n\nError:\nIf I try to start Monogame the second time and so on, Keyboard.GetState() is always empty and the memory is increasing for each time i start it. I think the problem is that objects/resources arn't disposed correctly, even when its started from an using statement. This will make the application grow until it crash and the user can't use keyboard inputs after the first time.\n\nI made a small .sln project to demostrate the problem:\nhttp://s000.tinyupload.com/download.php?file_id=05943256822998486463&t=0594325682299848646326883\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3962/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3961","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3961/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3961/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3961/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3961","id":90803130,"number":3961,"title":"XACT - Building XAP files","user":{"login":"kvenkateshan","id":11383753,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/11383753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvenkateshan","html_url":"https://github.com/kvenkateshan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvenkateshan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvenkateshan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvenkateshan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvenkateshan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvenkateshan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvenkateshan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvenkateshan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvenkateshan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvenkateshan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-06-24T23:16:24Z","updated_at":"2015-06-26T00:26:18Z","closed_at":"2015-06-26T00:26:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Can't seem to find much info on building and running XACT projects on monogame for windows.

arguments it got.\n\nAdvantages:\n- same project templates for Visual Studio and MonoDevelop/Xamarin Studio\n- Visual Studio Code support\n- Easily have advanced options, like if the person wants to use nuget or not\n  - another idea: ability to have templates/samples and downloading them only in case a project creation is started with them as base\n- would be able to have Local Copy enabled for MonoDevelop's MonoGame local references without any hacks\n\n@dellis1972 @tomspilman @KonajuGames What do you

Can you please make it easy (i.e. include a project template) for developing a regular Windows desktop application with XAML / Monogame? (i.e. \"MonoGame Windows (XAML) Project\") -- [or otherwise, if you can provide guidance, and I'm able to figure it out, I could submit a pull request...]\n\n2.) It seems this project template is missing all together in VS2015 (other project templates are there, but this one is just plain missing -- might be it's own issue / request, but I thought I'd check here first).\n\n3.) Is it possible to support XAML on other platforms as well (i.e. Linux, Android, etc.)?\n\n4.) Also, somewhat off-topic (I can log another issue, etc. if you like, but hopefully you can just point me  at some quick guidance here?), but the MonoGame slogan \"Write once, play everywhere\" seems to not be the default state if you're just using the out-of-the-box templates -- in the sense that, I have to create a new solution for each platform I want to support. -- Is there guidance on how to build a single solution with multiple projects in them that all share the same codebase? -- I thought about putting all my engine code into a portable library, but, it would have to reference the mono game DLLs, so it can't be a portable library... right? -- I suppose I could just add the same source files via \"Add as a Link\" in all the projects -- even then though, what should I do about the content projects? -- **bottom line: Is there official guidance here?**\n\nThank you! :-)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4856","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507242346","x-github-request-id":"AFEE:572D:1392DE0:2F8BB78:59D6A74D","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=69>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=200>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=67>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"544b095b7a087001256e3dd598dcf1f8\"","status":"200 OK"}}
