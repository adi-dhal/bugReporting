The entire spritesheet has a 828x2864 dimension. \n\nIt is composed of 8 frames, so to render it properly i need to draw it from a rectangle source of 828x358, starting at location x:0 y:0\n\nIn order to avoid declaring a new Rectangle instance at each draw call and to prevent flickering, i just want to displace the rectangle location on the Y-Axis by 358 pixels. Of course, the Y location is resetted to 0 at the end of the 8th frame.\n\nThe thing is, its never moving. Nothing changes when i try to use the Offset method. I tried to add all sorts of value, tried to used the Inflates() method with random values, EVERYTHING, and nothing changes or move by a pixel.\n\nIn fact, i'm facing two problems : if i declare each time a new Rectangle instance with a new location, all the background is flickering (the spritesheet is properly done, and im not declaring a new Texture2D instance at each time, everything is preloaded, so i assume this comes from the fact im calling new Rectangle2D at each draw). \n\nAnd if i want to use a more proper solution such as simply moving the rectangle, the offset method doesnt do anything. Does someone have an idea of what could possibly be the cause ?\n\nHere's an example of what im globally trying to do :\n\n//previously loaded rectangle\nMapView = new Rectangle(BackgroundRenderPosX, //0\n    BackgroundRenderPosY, //0\n    Tilesets.FirstOrDefault().TileWidth, //828\n    Tilesets.FirstOrDefault().TileHeight //358\n);\n\npublic void Update()\n{\n    if(MapView.Value.Y != Spritesheet.Height) {\n        MapView.Value.Offset(0, Tilesets.FirstOrDefault().TileHeight);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        MapView.Value.Offset(0, -SpriteSheet.Height);\n    }  \n}\n\nIt is not the real source code, but it really represents what i'm trying to do. Offset() just wont move my rectangle position.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nRational\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2839/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2838","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2838/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2838/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2838/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2838","id":38347493,"number":2838,"title":"Issue on iOS with quick taps","user":{"login":"mlaban","id":502919,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/502919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlaban","html_url":"https://github.com/mlaban","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlaban/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlaban/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlaban/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlaban/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlaban/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlaban/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlaban/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlaban/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlaban/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":22,"created_at":"2014-07-21T21:35:58Z","updated_at":"2014-08-01T19:21:13Z","closed_at":"2014-08-01T19:18:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm having issues on iOS with quick taps, when there is only one Press followed by one Release event.\n\nThe events are both coming in rapid succession that leaves no time for GetState() to be called, therefore, the event is removed by this line:\nif (existingTouch.State == TouchLocationState.Pressed && touch.State == TouchLocationState.Released)\n{\n   state.RemoveAt(i);\n}\n\nNot sure what the easy fix for this is without a queue.\nYou can repro by tapping rapidly on an iOS device.\n\ncc'ing: @danzel about the changelist:\nhttps://github.com/flyingdevelopmentstudio/MonoGame/commit/0f73fa9012f8d1c2c4ae3506fb31768e26e21d6d#diff-a0d5c96d48a8fc38b7fdd8a4832a5cc4\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2838/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2837","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2837/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2837/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2837/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2837","id":38291786,"number":2837,"title":"Renamed default project names from GameName to Game","user":{"login":"Chaosus","id":3036176,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3036176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus","html_url":"https://github.com/Chaosus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-07-21T10:34:35Z","updated_at":"2014-07-21T11:19:38Z","closed_at":"2014-07-21T11:19:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/2837","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2837","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2837.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2837.patch"},"body":"In XNA default project name is Game.

Team,\nI am using ASUS tablet to run my android app and application details are:\n1. I have a website opened in Android WebView component.\n2. Entered the text (say ABCD) at the textView and put my cursor at the beginning of text ( cursor before A letter) and pressing backspace button using android tablet keyboard..my application is going back word and generating memory dump.\n\nNote: We have override the functionality of backspace button in application opened in WebView to delete the entries. But to debug this issue i almost commented the code for backspace event.\n\nNot able to locate where is the issue..Need help to find out the issue.\n\nLogcat attached:\nW/NvCpuClient(  492): Failed to

Use Windows button on the phone to jump back and forth the app and main screen.\n\nAmount of leaked memory varies, but I tested with 4MB texture and it consumed device's memory about the same amount.\n\nHere's more information and sample code that I used for testing:\nhttp://community.monogame.net/t/sharpdx-crashing-the-app-after-having-resumed-a-few-times/813\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2822/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2821","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2821/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2821/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2821/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2821","id":37965692,"number":2821,"title":"Build Script Improvements","user":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-07-16T09:52:44Z","updated_at":"2014-07-16T10:39:23Z","closed_at":"2014-07-16T10:39:23Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/2821","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2821","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2821.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2821.patch"},"body":"This does a little refactoring of the main build script to better organize the steps and see build times.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2821/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2820","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2820/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2820/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2820/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2820","id":37958526,"number":2820,"title":"Android IsFixedTimeStep=true Locks Up On Android 2.x","user":{"login":"JRC-BitBull","id":7208690,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7208690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JRC-BitBull","html_url":"https://github.com/JRC-BitBull","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JRC-BitBull/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JRC-BitBull/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JRC-BitBull/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JRC-BitBull/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JRC-BitBull/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JRC-BitBull/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JRC-BitBull/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JRC-BitBull/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JRC-BitBull/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-07-16T08:08:30Z","updated_at":"2014-07-22T07:25:18Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I am using game.IsFixedTimeStep = true to set a fixed frame rate for my game and have to date encountered no issues with this.\n\nToday I tested on the GenyMotion emulator running 2.3.7 with the latest MG develop build and am getting really strange behaviour.

reverts #2789 since it wasn't the proper fix for Android since it was moving the task to the background in all cases without letting the user code to handle its own logic for the back button.\n\nAfter further investigation is seems that the only viable option (that doesn't involve new public API to handle this case) is to change the Game.Exit behavior on android to always call Activity.MoveTaskToBack() since actually exiting the app is usually frowned upon. The app code should decide what to do when Gamepad.Back is set to true (call Game.Exit or navigate the game menu stack).\n\nFor some reason AndroidGameActivity.cs below is not cleanly merged; I tried to redo this pull request a couple times with the same result; this is due to another PR that was merged after #2789. The only thing that changed in there is OnBackPressed() handler being removed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2812","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2812/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2812/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2812/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2812","id":37825665,"number":2812,"title":"Android 4.4 KitKat Home/Back Button Black Screen","user":{"login":"jakepoz","id":392417,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/392417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakepoz","html_url":"https://github.com/jakepoz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakepoz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakepoz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakepoz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakepoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakepoz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakepoz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakepoz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakepoz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakepoz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2014-07-14T20:37:33Z","updated_at":"2017-01-12T00:53:53Z","closed_at":"2017-01-12T00:53:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We have been testing the latest build of Monogame that includes the fixes from issue #2600.\n\nFast resume is working perfectly if you click on an in-game ad or launch a url/browser and then return back to the game.\n\nBut on a Sony Xperia Z, running Android 4.4, there are some issues with leaving the game using the home button.\n\nSteps:\n1.
