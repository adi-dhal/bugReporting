But when the effect is used, texture A is sampled with sampler state B and vice versa.\n\nCause:\nMonoGame assumes that textures and samplers are always bound to the same slot at the pixel shader state. But in this example this is not the case. When I debug 2MGFX and check the shader reflection info, I can see that texture A is bound at slot 1 and sampler A is bound at slot 0. \nMy interpretation is: Textures are assigned to texture slots in the order in which they are used (i.e. the order of the tex2d() calls). Sampler states are assigned to slots in the order in which they are defined.\n\nSolution:\nIn 2MGFX, store the textureSlot and samplerSlot with the sampler info - not only a single index for both. - I have made some quick tests and this should solve the problem. Should I prepare a pull request?\n\nWorkaround:\nIn the effect file, always define the textures+samplers in the order in which they are used.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1458","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1458/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1458/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1458/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1458","id":11399722,"number":1458,"title":"Numbers in generated GLSL are invalid on PCs with non-English culture","user":{"login":"Helikin","id":3626369,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3626369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Helikin","html_url":"https://github.com/Helikin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Helikin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Helikin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Helikin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Helikin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Helikin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Helikin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Helikin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Helikin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Helikin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2013-02-26T09:22:41Z","updated_at":"2013-02-26T22:02:02Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Problem:\nI build a simple shader using the MGEffectProcessor.

It does not work if we treat the last level as 4x4.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1453/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1452","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1452/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1452/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1452/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1452","id":11348448,"number":1452,"title":"[TEST ME] Hotfix 3.0.1","user":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2013-02-25T06:33:32Z","updated_at":"2014-06-14T10:43:43Z","closed_at":"2013-03-05T22:54:31Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/1452","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1452","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1452.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1452.patch"},"body":"These are the changes for the 3.0.1 hotfix release.\n\nIt includes the following fixes:\n- Fix template error @fcfa5b0\n- Fix offsetInBytes parameter in IndexBuffer/VertexBuffer SetData @bcc60a1 \n- Fixes the scale applied on the origin in SpriteBatch @7fe7b20 @8433289\n- Fixed render targets on WP8 @f8141b8 \n- Removed minVertexIndex Exception 47ffc27 @8aab6da \n- Fixed some threading issues on iOS @08eb088 \n- Use generic link for opening store on iOS @e780d76 @b797bca @ead3f4b\n- Fix Matrix::Transpose @a1249c0\n- Fixed vertexOffset in DrawUserIndexedPrimitives in GL @ca30693\n- Keys.RightControl/RightShift Support for WinRT @bf1a7b1\n- Dispose in ShaderProgramCache @c6c7ca0\n- IsRunningSlowly Fix @7991b20\n\nWe need to build and test the installers from the hotfix branch to be sure they are acceptable to release before we merge this into master and make a v3.0.1 tag.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1451","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1451/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1451/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1451/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1451","id":11340276,"number":1451,"title":"Unable to use/force OpenGL 1.1 (for performance reasons)","user":{"login":"ddebilt","id":2000539,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2000539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebilt","html_url":"https://github.com/ddebilt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebilt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebilt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebilt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebilt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebilt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebilt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebilt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebilt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebilt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2013-02-24T21:13:41Z","updated_at":"2013-02-24T23:01:09Z","closed_at":"2013-02-24T23:01:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue was found using the iOS project, but may apply to other platforms as well. When forcing OpenGL 1.1 in iOSGameView.cs->CreateContext, a MonoGameGLException is thrown in GraphicsExtensions.cs->CheckGLError, with an \"Invalid Operation\" (All.InvalidOperation) error. (see entire stack trace below). I haven't dug into why this is happening because I don't know that much about OpenGL yet.\n\nOpenGL 1.1 performs much better on older devices for the 2D game I am working on, and the OpenGL 2.0 path seems that it would only be usable if I were to try and eliminate almost all overdrawing.\n\nHere are the FPS rates that I see with 1.1 vs. 2.0, when drawing the same texture \"n\" times, with a destination rectangle equal to the resolution of the device's screen (in this test case, the destination rectangle was 960x640 on the iPhone 4 - source texture size didn't matter):\n\nOpen GL 1.1:\n\nMG 3.0\n- unable to use OpenGL 1.1\n\nMG 2.x\n- 1-4 draws: 60fps\n- 5 draws: 55fps\n- 10 draws: 30fps\n\nOpen GL 2.0:\n\nAll MG versions (MG 2.0, 2.5, 3.0) are the same:\n- 1 draw: 59-60fps\n- 1.5 draws: 42fps (one destination of 960x640, another destination of 480x640)\n- 2 draws: 32fps\n- 3 draws: 22fps\n- 4 draws: 16fps\n- 5 draws: 13fps\n- 10 draws: 7fps\n\nIn the game I am working on, I draw a background image with a destination of 960x640, then other images on top, and because of the extra overdrawing, the frame rate drops dramatically. When using MG 2.x, and forcing OpenGL 1.1, I maintain 60fps.\n\nI would like to use MG 3, and force OpenGL 1.1 on older hardware.\n\nStack Trace:\n\n>   0x29 in

the sketch effect.\n\nFirst of all here's the screenshot of XNA version demonstrating the effect;\n\n![xna](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/73215/182842/2760922e-7c7a-11e2-902a-a8ae8b314821.png)\n\nAnd here's output from MonoGame-Metro counterpart;\n\n![metro](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/73215/182843/404cff52-7c7a-11e2-9483-96192e14bddf.png)\n\nActually the effect file included with XNA sample has multiple effects in it, so I trimmed it down as;\n\n``` shader\nsampler SceneSampler : register(s0) = sampler_state\n{\n    Texture = SceneTexture;\n\n    MinFilter = Linear;\n    MagFilter = Linear;\n\n    AddressU = Clamp;\n    AddressV = Clamp;\n};\n\ntexture SketchTexture;\n\nsampler SketchSampler : register(s2) = sampler_state\n{\n    Texture = SketchTexture;\n\n    AddressU = Wrap;\n    AddressV = Wrap;\n};\n\nfloat4 PixelShaderFunction(float2 texCoord : TEXCOORD0) : COLOR0\n{\n    float3 scene = tex2D(SceneSampler, texCoord);\n    float3 saturatedScene = saturate((scene - SketchThreshold) * 2);       \n    float3 sketchPattern = tex2D(SketchSampler, texCoord + SketchJitter);    \n    float3 negativeSketch = (1 - saturatedScene) * (1 - sketchPattern);    \n    float sketchResult = dot(1 - negativeSketch, SketchBrightness);\n\n    scene *= sketchResult;\n    return float4(scene, 1);\n}\n\ntechnique ColorSketch\n{\n    pass P0\n    {\n        PixelShader = compile ps_2_0 PixelShaderFunction();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFor monogame-metro, I instead use; \n\n``` shader\ntechnique ColorSketch\n{\n    pass P0\n    {\n        PixelShader = compile ps_4_0_level_9_1 PixelShaderFunction();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd i compile it as;\n\n``` shell\n2MGFX.exePostprocessEffect.Metro.fx PostprocessEffect.Metro.mgfxo /DEBUG /DX11\n```\n\nMy basic render-target & effect code;\n\n``` csharp\nprotected override void Draw(GameTime gameTime)\n        {\n            GraphicsDevice.SetRenderTarget(sceneRenderTarget);\n            GraphicsDevice.Clear(Color.CornflowerBlue);\n\n            this.spriteBatch.Begin();\n            //this.spriteBatch.Draw(this._sample,this.GraphicsDevice.PresentationParameters.Bounds,Color.White);\n            this.spriteBatch.End();\n\n            GraphicsDevice.SetRenderTarget(null);\n            ApplyPostprocess();\n\n            base.Draw(gameTime);\n        }\n\n        private void ApplyPostprocess()\n        {\n            EffectParameterCollection parameters = _postprocessEffect.Parameters;\n\n            // Set effect parameters controlling the pencil sketch effect.\n            parameters[\"SketchThreshold\"].SetValue(SketchThreshold);\n            parameters[\"SketchBrightness\"].SetValue(SketchBrightness);\n            parameters[\"SketchJitter\"].SetValue(_sketchJitter);\n            parameters[\"SketchTexture\"].SetValue(_sketchTexture);\n\n            // Activate the appropriate effect technique.\n            _postprocessEffect.CurrentTechnique = _postprocessEffect.Techniques[\"ColorSketch\"];\n\n            // Draw a fullscreen sprite to apply the postprocessing effect.\n            spriteBatch.Begin(0, BlendState.AlphaBlend, null, null, null, _postprocessEffect);\n            spriteBatch.Draw(sceneRenderTarget, Vector2.Zero, Color.White);\n            spriteBatch.End();\n        }\n```\n\nSo chances that either render-target support is broken for WP8/Metro or the effect isn't working all good with MonoGame - or I'm doing something horrible with my code :)\n- I've [uploaded a sample project](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/197820/monogame/SketchSample.rar) that both has XNA and MonoGame-Metro version included for easier testing purposes.\n- Note: I'm using develop branch (and also tried the stable 3.0 release).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1436/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1435","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1435/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1435/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1435/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1435","id":11259108,"number":1435,"title":"iOS Orientations","user":{"login":"Zambiorix","id":485492,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/485492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zambiorix","html_url":"https://github.com/Zambiorix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zambiorix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zambiorix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zambiorix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zambiorix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zambiorix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zambiorix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zambiorix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zambiorix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zambiorix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":13,"created_at":"2013-02-21T20:24:35Z","updated_at":"2013-03-21T22:21:34Z","closed_at":"2013-03-05T17:01:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Tested on iOS 6.1 (iPad 2, 3 and iPhone 5)\n\n1) Setting GraphicsDeviceManager.SupportedOrientations does not change anything.
