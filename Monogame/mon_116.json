In an attempt to make sure lines don't start with negative bearing, the initial `offset.X` was incorrectly always set to 0 (`offset.X==0` for firstGlyphOfLine), which is not in sync with XNA behavior. It's true that the _minimum_ initial offset should be 0, but it's not true that the _maximum_ initial offset should be 0. If the first glyph of a line starts with positive LeftSideBearing, then that should be added to the start of the line.\n\nPretty much any monospaced bitmap/pixel font provides a good test case, e.g., [Namco's Classic Arcade Font](https://www.google.com/search?q=namco+classic+arcade+font&tbm=isch). Notice how the shorter \"T\" character in \"THE\" is incorrectly flush with the left side of the line in the [top half of this image](http://i.imgur.com/Ilp3lrC.png) (pre-bug fix) causing the letters to fall out of alignment later on in the line, but the \"T\" characters are correctly offset by their left side bearing in the bottom half (post-bug fix) which keeps everything in alignment (and in sync with XNA behavior).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2538/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2537","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2537/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2537/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2537/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2537","id":33438789,"number":2537,"title":"Improved

.NET and .GamerServices files and references moved to new .NET libraries for all platforms\n\nFully tested on all platforms\nIssues logged for code comments:\n- #2510 Android platform calls Net.Session.Exit in AndroidGamePlatform.cs\n- #2511 OpenTKGamePlatform has been updated and calls Net.Session.Exit\n- #2512 iOS platform calls Guide.Initialise in iOSGamePlatform.cs\n- #2513 PSM platform calls Net.Session.Exit in PSSGamePlatform.cs\n- #2515 MacOS platform Uses GamerServices in MacGamePlatform.cs\n\n.gitignore updated to ignore the new .NET .csproj files\nGUID generated for new projects\n\nTook slightly longer than anticipated as some recent PR's must have added new items.  \nWindows Phone is a concern because there is no Lidgren library for Windows Phone in third Party libs, so NET domain excluded and come of GamerServices that depend on NET.\nThere was a lot of tidy up with WindowsPhone as most GamerServices files were excluded for some unexplained reason, considered dropping NET dll from phone completely.  Instead it has most of the lib except NET for now.  Will need revisiting.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2513","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2513/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2513/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2513/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2513","id":33257587,"number":2513,"title":"PSM
