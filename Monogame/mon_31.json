allows `#line` directives to be used in effect files.\n\nAs part of Protogame, we have our own asset system which underneath passes effect code to MonoGame's content pipeline for compilation.  To do this, we write the effect code to a temporary file on disk, and tell the effect processor to compile that file.  We preemptively resolve includes on the string in memory before we pass the effect code to MonoGame, so there are no external dependencies on other files.\n\nRight now, the CppNet preprocessor strips out any `#line` directives in the source code, even though they are recognised by the underlying shader compiler.  We want to use `#line` directives when we pass the content into MonoGame's content pipeline so that the filenames and line numbers match with our actual source files, and don't just have the temporary filename on disk (and incorrectly offset line numbers due to includes).\n\nThis change detects `#line` directives before they are passed into CppNet, and encodes them as a comment.  When reading the output from the preprocessor, they then get transformed back into `#line` directives again so that they exist for the underlying shader compiler.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5076","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5076/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5076/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5076/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5076","id":169616011,"number":5076,"title":"Multiple Videoplayers (Windows)","user":{"login":"hagenah","id":20859674,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/20859674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagenah","html_url":"https://github.com/hagenah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagenah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagenah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagenah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagenah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagenah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagenah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagenah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagenah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagenah/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-08-05T14:11:02Z","updated_at":"2016-08-06T16:39:16Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\nI tried to use multiple Videoplayers simultaneously.

This changes tests that were visual, but did not actually need that. This will speed up tests a bit and make it easier to implement new tests. Note that this is not yet finished.\n\nFor now this just does tests that do not need to draw, but do need a GraphicsDevice. While working on this I figured we can go further than that and even tests that do draw not use a window. Draw tests can render to a render target without actually running the game loop. That would make almost all tests not use a window and will improve testing performance and make it easier to implement new visual tests because you can just draw as you would in your game Draw function. Thoughts on this? Either way I'll do the non-drawing tests first.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5072/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5071","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5071/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5071/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5071/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5071","id":169403451,"number":5071,"title":"[Dev Pipeline Tool UX] exits app when clicking on any of the content items","user":{"login":"kennethsuda","id":1162801,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1162801?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethsuda","html_url":"https://github.com/kennethsuda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethsuda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethsuda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethsuda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethsuda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethsuda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethsuda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethsuda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethsuda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethsuda/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/9","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestone/9","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/9/labels","id":1441958,"number":9,"title":"3.6 Release","description":"More unit tests, running unit tests on Mac and Linux, SDL2 replacing OpenTK.","creator":{"login":"dellis1972","id":810617,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/810617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972","html_url":"https://github.com/dellis1972","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":148,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-12-03T11:17:13Z","updated_at":"2017-08-21T16:42:53Z","due_on":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2017-03-09T08:22:27Z"},"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-08-04T15:30:22Z","updated_at":"2016-10-12T00:58:43Z","closed_at":"2016-10-12T00:58:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"After opening a .mgcb file with the Pipeline UX from the current Develop branch, clicking on any content item terminates the application on MacOS El Capitan.

This is a start to getting GraphicsDevice and GraphicsDeviceManager events right and handling PresentationParameters the same as in XNA.\n\nI may have done a seperate PR for this, but I also added a simple method to TestGameBase that initializes the game without creating a window. This can speed up a lot of test that are 'visual' but don't need to be. I already fixed a couple that just needed a GraphicsDevice, but not necessarily a window... Actually, most tests don't **really** need a window, right? Note that we can't get around that for XNA tests. Other tests that can benefit are RasterizerState and Viewport among others.\n\nThere's more testing to be done and GraphicsDevice events also needs its events fixed, but that might be better to do in a seperate PR. I did do the Disposed event though, because of how easy it was and I couldn't resist :p\n\nThis fixes at least (I'll add issues here as I find them)\n- fixes #539\n- fixes #4433\n- fixes #3114\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5068","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5068/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5068/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5068/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5068","id":169245258,"number":5068,"title":"[DO

This caused our unit tests to fail in #5042. \n\nWe currently have [`SoundEffectInstancePool`](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/Audio/SoundEffectInstancePool.cs) to manage all SoundEffectInstances (and dispose of them in the Shutdown method) and [`DynamicSoundEffectInstanceManager`](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/Audio/DynamicSoundEffectInstanceManager.cs) to manage **playing** DynamicSoundEffectInstances, but not ones that are not currently playing.
