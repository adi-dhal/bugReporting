`ContentCompiler::GetTypeWriter(Type)`, and I found that `Type.IsGeneric` isn't handled differently than vanilla types. \n\nSo.....I commented out the `else if(type.IsGenericType)`. This funneled these Generic types into the `else` and handles them the same way XNA would, which is to wrap the type in the `ReflectiveWriter<T>`. I'm not exactly sure why or what the expected behavior is, but I can tell you now the XML content in the RPG Starter Kit is processed successful into proper XNBs.\n\nYou may want to take a

to do to fix it?\nI did this 18bef3e411efae6ecaa243cab9c06414cde3ab7f but it won't work on linux.\nI tried checking src.IsAbsoluteUri, but it is always true even for relative paths.\nWe could pass through a bool stating if the first path is absolute or not? :-/\n\nThanks

posted this on the CodePlex site but realized that this is a better place to put it. Here's the original topic (as well as a sample project that replicates the issue): https://monogame.codeplex.com/workitem/7897\n\nBasically, I'm developing a Windows 8.1 game using XAML and MonoGame 3.2. I have a menu option that the player can click that exits the game using Application.Current.Exit(). If a SoundEffect is loaded through XNA's ContentManager, it causes an error similar to the following:\n\n'MyGame.exe' (CLR v4.0.30319: Immersive Application Domain): Loaded 'C:\\Users\\me\\Documents\\Other Projects\\Games\\MyGame\\MyGame\\MyGame\\bin\\Windows8\\Debug\\AppX\\SharpDX.XAudio2.DLL'.

Cannot find or open the PDB file.\n\nI have narrowed it down to SoundEffects, as when I don't load any the game closes just fine. I suspect there is some memory leak of some sort as this topic mentions: http://community.monogame.net/t/soundeffect-loaded-via-contentmanager-causing-memory-leak-after-resume/1174/2\n\nI hope that this issue is resolved soon.

PR has a couple of `VideoPlayer` improvements.\n\nMost of our video players don't correctly report `MediaState.Stopped` when a video finishes playing.  So I added an internal `PlatformGetState` method that is called on each call to the `VideoPlayer.State` getter.  It was setup to be optional as I didn't have the time or ability to fix all the platform players to correctly support it.  I fixed the Windows desktop DX platform to support it and that is it.\n\nI fixed `PlayPosition` for Windows desktop DX platform.\n\nThere is also a small fix to the unit test framework.

Thankfully all the code was already present in OrientationListener. AndroidCompatibility contained code to account for the swapped LandscapeLeft and LandscapeRight on Kindle, so I decided to move the code there from OrientationListener.\n\nNow you can get the proper display orientation from AndroidCompatibility. It accounts for both the natural orientation and the Kindle landscape swap.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3023","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3023/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3023/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3023/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3023","id":44063787,"number":3023,"title":"Added

is a bug with the Obscure event.\nThe bug occurs sometimes when resume from the Lock screen and cause the\napp to pause on a blank screen.\nIt never happens when the phone is attacked to the debugger so this\nrequired some sort of on-screen logging to figure out.\n(ver:8.10.14157.200, drv:3056.40000.1404.0003, Lumia Black) \n\ncase #1\nApplicationIdleDetectionMode=Enabled (default)\nApp is suspended either by timeout or power button.\n\nObscured event triggered. IsLocked=true.\nIt's safe to ignore the Obscure event since the OS deactivates the app\nanyway. IsActive is set to false by OnDeactivate.\nWhen the user unlock the phone Unobscure event triggered but _SOMETIMES_\nanother Obscured event arrive after that, causing to app to remain in IsActive=false state.\nThat's why we need to ignore the event.\n\ncase #2\nApplicationIdleDetectionMode=Disabled\nApp is suspended either by timeout or power button.\n\nObscured event triggered. IsLocked=true.\nWe set IsActive=false on Obscure event as before.\nWhen the user unlock the phone Unobscure event triggered and we set\nIsActive=true.\nActually a second obscured event is triggered following by an\nUnobscured, not an issue here.\nIn that mode the OS doesn't deactivate the app, allowing the app to run\nunder lock screen.\nnote: actually MonoGame doesn't allow run under lock screen\nhttps://github.com/mono/MonoGame/pull/2084.\n\ncase #3\nApplicationIdleDetectionMode=Enabled|Disabled\nApp is suspended by a phone call.\n\nObscured event triggered. IsLocked=false.\nWe set IsActive=false on Obscure event as before.\nWhen the action that obscured the app ends, an Unobscure event is\ntriggered and we set IsActive=true. No bug here.\nThat is similar to case #2, the OS doesn't deactivate the app.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3020/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4825","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507242346","x-github-request-id":"DFD1:01FC:FD7599:2942D51:59D6A7BD","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=100>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=200>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=98>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"7cd66f031b2a8f4f85ca544540e713aa\"","status":"200 OK"}}
