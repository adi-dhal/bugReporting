Discussions about individual separations  and the work involved should be kept separate.**\n\nRight, following on from the .Net (networking) separation, I thought I'd open up a fresh discussion about moving on from there.  There has been a lot of talk about splitting out the namespaces into separate deliverables (regardless of platform) to ease deliver, management and consumption of the Monogame.Framework.\n\n**A lot of the talk devolved into discussions about platforms or PCL's, this discussion is ONLY for discussing how the breakup should continue from an architectural view, please keep this discussion on target.**\n\n**The XNA Story**\nOK, So from XNA's view, their deployment had the following deliverables (as a start point for discussion only) _excluding the already complete .NET separation_\n- Microsoft.Xna.Framework.dll\n- Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Avatar.dll\n- Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game.dll\n- Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.dll\n- Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input.Touch.dll\n- Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Storage.dll\n- Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Video.dll\n- Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Xact.dll\n\n**Initial MonoGame Proposal**\nAs others have stated on numerous occasions, I also do not feel that MonoGame should go this far.  My gut feel (as a starter for 10) is that we should look towards the following design:\n- Monogame.Framework\n- MonoGame.Framework.Graphics\n- MonoGame.Gramework.Storage\n\nI also have a view that the MonoGame.Framework library should also contain all code that is non-platform specific (no #IFs) but this may need to be considered on a namespace by namespace basis as some may need to be in the separate library to allow for better modularisation or a plugin style approach.\n\nKeep the fight clean and GO.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2550/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2549","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2549/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2549/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2549/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2549","id":33565883,"number":2549,"title":"TileContainer Initialize should be Public","user":{"login":"jogibear9988","id":364896,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/364896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jogibear9988","html_url":"https://github.com/jogibear9988","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jogibear9988/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jogibear9988/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jogibear9988/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jogibear9988/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jogibear9988/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jogibear9988/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jogibear9988/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jogibear9988/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jogibear9988/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2014-05-15T08:52:27Z","updated_at":"2014-05-19T20:51:09Z","closed_at":"2014-05-16T13:58:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm using my own Game implementation.
