The problem is that as monogame isn't 100% compatible with XNA 4.0 yet, I hit spots where i need that #monogame symbol. Let me explain in details;\n\nAs I'm working on a block engine with millions of blocks in memory, I'm using other threads to generate, lighten and build vertices. \n\nSo within the last step my code creates new VertexBuffer's in those off-threads which at the moment seems MonoGame/develop3d branch doesn't support and throws;\n\nthrow new NotImplementedException(\"Threaded creation of GPU resources is not currently supported on this platform\");\n\nSo a solution I came with is adding #monogame symbol to my block engine's monogame version project and using as;\n\n```\n            #if !MONOGAME\n                        if (!this.CacheThreadStarted)\n                        {\n                            var cacheThread = new Thread(CacheThread) { IsBackground = true };\n                            cacheThread.Start();\n\n                            this.CacheThreadStarted = true;\n                        }\n            #else\n                        this.Process();\n            #endif\n```\n\nSo wouldn't it be better if monogame framework project's define #monogame symbol on their own so for project that targets XNA and monogame together can differentiate the underlying framework?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/392","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/392/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/392/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/392/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/392","id":3777647,"number":392,"title":"Added
