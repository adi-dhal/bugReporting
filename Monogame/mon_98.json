are now moving all our projects to MG 3.2. We are currently working with the /develop branch. \n\nWe would like to actively contribute to the MG project since we are using it from its early stage and we are very skilled on Xamarin over iOS and Android :) We were used to work on a \"modifed by us\" version of MG 2.5 which had applied some fixes made by us. We got several products on the store published thanks to MG. Ok enough with chatting.\n\nWe are in the middle of making some tests to understand where the MG 3.2 \"fails\" to operate on features we were used to see working on the older version.\n\nThe first issue is related to loading musics and videos. This feature it seems not to work properly on windows/iOS and maybe android. The issue is related to this line of code in the FileHelper.cs\n\n```\n        // The uri now contains the path to the relativeFile with relative addresses resolved\n        // Get the local path and skip the first character (the path separator)\n        return NormalizeFilePathSeparators(dst.LocalPath.Substring(1));\n```\n\nIs the Substring(1) really necessary? If I change it to Substring(0) all works fine!\nIn windows the value for dst.LocalPath is something like \"C:/../../Content\\mycontentfile.xnb\". When Substring(1) takes place the path become \":/../../Content\\mycontentfile.xnb\" which is invalid. Same thing for iOS except there's no \"C:\\\" but only \"/User/../../\"\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3064/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3063","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3063/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3063/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3063/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3063","id":45461985,"number":3063,"title":"Improvements

the file **StorageContainer.cs** the function **CreateDirectoryAbsolute** was crashing on the **PSM** branch of the project.\n\nThe fix was as simple as wrapping the **Directory.CreateDirectory(path);** call with an if block to test if the directory already exists.\n\n_Line 198:_\n**Directory.CreateDirectory(path);**\n\n_Becomes:_\n**if

The goal is to have everyone using the same networking code that functions across all XNA implementations (including Microsoft XNA4), both to reduce duplicated effort and simplify cross-platform networking (particularly if you plan to roll your own proprietary implementation of these namespaces; Steamworks versions based on the MonoGame GamerServices/Net code are a common example).\n\nHow the separate repository is integrated into the main MonoGame repository, and how the migration will play out, I will of course leave to the MonoGame team. Once the repo is ready (however it is made ready), I'll submit the FNA configuration ASAP.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3055/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3054","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3054/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3054/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3054/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3054","id":45298907,"number":3054,"title":"Fix Texture2D.GetData() on GLES platforms","user":{"login":"prollin","id":502478,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/502478?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin","html_url":"https://github.com/prollin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2014-10-08T21:23:41Z","updated_at":"2015-02-11T13:01:16Z","closed_at":"2014-10-09T09:08:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/3054","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3054","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3054.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3054.patch"},"body":"Fix and Simplified Texture2D.GetData()\nWorks on both iOS and Android (Tested on iPad Mini 1st Gen, iPhone 6, Nexus 7 1st Gen and Nexus 5)\nRemoved superfluous large memory allocations\n\nWARNING: Only renderable surface formats are supported.
