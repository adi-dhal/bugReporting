There is surely a better way.\r\n* To mimic Visual Studio links, when using \"Alt\" key to drag/drop files, no confirmation is required and \"Link\" is selected, as well as applyToAll.\r\n* To mimic VS, when adding links that are not included in the project (because they already are included) a message box is shown. (In VS it appears in the log, but I didn't find a log to include it, and it was very confusing when files were not added without apparent reason). The message does not appear when copying (unless I messed up)\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately using git when other human users are around is too much for an old git like me (pun intended) and I've set up a project and uploaded all the changes there (that's the most I can do in git without spending an hour looking at documentation).\r\nHere it is:  https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/compare/develop...KakCAT:pipeline_tool_link_patch   (I don't even know if this is the link I should be posting XD ) \r\n\r\nIt also mixes several different features in a single PR, which shouldn't be done, and some variable names might not be congruent with the coding style of the project. Not even mentioning tabs and spaces and formatting :)\r\n\r\nFinally, I have no idea at all of the Pipeline tool, so some pieces of code are more a dirty hack than a nice piece for a PR. I just hope the repository is useful to somebody with more Pipeline tool knowledge to integrate it. On the bright side I've overcommented some parts to give the 'integrator' a clue of what I'm doing :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMissing features I haven't been able to figure out:\r\n* When deleting a linked file, the tree is not updated (I spent hours trying to figure why, so I left it blank). When deleting folders it is OK.  It is very annoying (do you have any clue, @cra0zy ? )\r\n* Icons should have a \"link\" icon when linking.\r\n* To mimic Visual Studio links, deleting a bunch of linked files should show no delete confirmation.\r\n* The linking system is a bit sensitive when it founds '\\\\' instead of '/', which shouldn't appear unless you edit the mgcb manually. I suppose the fix to this problem should be when loading the file from disk, so I decided not to touch that.\r\n* Renaming linked assets do not work (it's easily doable but I don't know if it should be done. VS won't let you)\r\n* Some bits will only work in windows (no idea of xwt, sorry)\r\n\r\nI've been testing this for a few days with 2 of my projects without problems, but maybe my workflow doesn't show them. At least I think it's a good starting port to support file linking referred in #5109

testing the PR that removes OpenTK for Android we noticed that if Android game loop is running on the worker thread instead of the UI thread that the TouchPanelState class is accessed from the worker and UI thread at the same time without locking.\r\n\r\nThis works fine in 99.999999% of cases but we managed to get a bug just once (which is what led us to this PR) - due to where the bug happened I assume the internal touch state was being converted to an array while it was modified in the 'GetState' function: new TouchCollection (_touchState.ToArray ())\r\n\r\nHow it was tested so far:\r\n\r\nThis PR was build and tested on AWS device farm on a Random Salad Games game. The game was running on the UI thread. It passed all tests.\r\n\r\nSame as 1) but this time 'RenderOnUIThread' was set to false. This time it crashed with an error in the OpenTK lib. I assume it was because OpenTK doesn't support game loop in worker thread properly? If this is so, then this isn't a problem since OpenTK is getting removed.\r\n\r\nSince the goal of this PR is to be able to work when game loop is on a worker thread we tested this with my fixed version of PR #5410 .

However, since my projects were correctly referencing the Monogame assemblies I had no issues running my work.  I only noticed this when I wanted to test out a new Monogame extension.\r\n\r\nI uninstalled Monogame 3.5 believing it was an issue with my current installation and performed a re-install.  However, during the re-install process all of the available template selections were grayed out and not selectable as a result.\r\n\r\nI cancelled the installation and tried the Monogame 3.6 installation finding the same issue.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be a rather substantial issue on the forums.
