I'm hoping to release a windows title in a few weeks so I really appreciate any input on this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1954/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1953","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1953/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1953/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1953/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1953","id":18441409,"number":1953,"title":"Fix Texture2D PVRTC size computation","user":{"login":"prollin","id":502478,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/502478?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin","html_url":"https://github.com/prollin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2013-08-22T21:30:59Z","updated_at":"2014-07-11T02:52:06Z","closed_at":"2013-08-26T12:38:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/1953","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1953","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1953.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1953.patch"},"body":"PVRTC imagesize computation was inverted between PVRTC 2bpp and PVRTC 4bpp (see Issue 6 in http://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/extensions/IMG/IMG_texture_compression_pvrtc.txt for source)\n\nAlso added missing support to initialize a Texture2D with ETC1 surfaceformat\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1952","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1952/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1952/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1952/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1952","id":18434325,"number":1952,"title":"Add support for border color clamp texture addressing","user":{"login":"JoelBennett","id":3631501,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3631501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoelBennett","html_url":"https://github.com/JoelBennett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoelBennett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoelBennett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoelBennett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoelBennett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoelBennett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoelBennett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoelBennett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoelBennett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoelBennett/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-08-22T19:31:22Z","updated_at":"2015-03-20T22:58:29Z","closed_at":"2015-03-20T22:58:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"As mentioned here (https://monogame.codeplex.com/discussions/454253), it would be nice to have a border color clamp texture address mode.

issue affect MonoGame on Windows GL but may affect other platforms too. It affects MonoGame 3.0, and also 3.2.\n\nBasically loading a texture with this code (F#):\n\n```\nuse file = System.IO.File.OpenRead(\"testTexture.png\")\nthis.texture <- Texture2D.FromStream(this.GraphicsDevice, file)\n```\n\nand rendering with this code:\n\n```\nthis.spriteBatch.Begin(SpriteSortMode.Immediate, BlendState.NonPremultiplied);\nthis.spriteBatch.Draw(this.texture, Vector2.Zero, Color.White)\nthis.spriteBatch.End()\n```\n\nwill reproduce the error. This code works fine and renders fine when using the XNA4 libraries, but has weird alpha blending artefacts when using MonoGame.\n\nHere's some renderings to illustrate the issue. First the correct renderings using the XNA libraries\n![Image](http://i.imgur.com/2Rtqhuk.png)\n\nNow the bad renderings using MonoGame:\n\n![Image](http://i.imgur.com/Dny26gI.png)\n\nI've tried to figure out the nature of the issue, but havne;t gotten very far besides realising that it's not a simple case of `BlendState.NonPremultiplied` being ignored or something similar. For examples, on analysis I've noticed the green colour channel blends differently than the red and blue colour channels among other odd things. I've creates a large image that illustrates the issue I've noticed in what is hopefully a useful way:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/CEUQqm0.png\n\nHere's the project files for reproducing the bad rendering (F# project):\nhttp://www.qfpost.com/file/d?g=EhZh52Zjc\n\nI also made a post about this issue on stack overflow which may be worth monitoring:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/18320633/loading-texture-form-png-in-monogame-transaprency-issue\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1946/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1945","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1945/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1945/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1945/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1945","id":18287345,"number":1945,"title":"Migration of MonoGame to Protobuild","user":{"login":"hach-que","id":504826,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/504826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que","html_url":"https://github.com/hach-que","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":86,"created_at":"2013-08-20T10:08:27Z","updated_at":"2014-06-16T09:11:22Z","closed_at":"2014-01-22T04:52:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/1945","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1945","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1945.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1945.patch"},"body":"Protobuild is a cross-platform project generation system, addressing https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/issues/1722.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1945/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1944","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1944/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1944/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1944/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1944","id":18274459,"number":1944,"title":"Added support for EXT versions of OpenGL framebuffer object (FBO) method...","user":{"login":"MichaelDePiazzi","id":5249498,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5249498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi","html_url":"https://github.com/MichaelDePiazzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":61,"created_at":"2013-08-20T02:16:04Z","updated_at":"2014-06-14T14:34:50Z","closed_at":"2014-02-25T01:11:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/1944","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1944","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1944.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1944.patch"},"body":"This patch adds support for the EXT versions of the OpenGL framebuffer object (FBO) methods. The EXT versions will only be used if the ARB versions are not supported. It will also check for FBO support and throw an exception if it's not supported.\n\nThis should address issues reported in issue #998 and also issue #811.\n\nI tested this under Windows 7 on my laptop (which only has the EXT FBO methods) and also my desktop (which supports the ARB versions). This should also work under Linux and MacOS, but I was unable to test this. I also had to make changes to all other projects using OpenGL to support this patch, but I was also unable to test this. Hopefully I haven't missed anything and everything is still working as expected.\n\nPS. This is my first every pull request, so please be gentle :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1944/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1943","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1943/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1943/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1943/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1943","id":18110110,"number":1943,"title":"Removing [Flags] From the Keys.cs enum.","user":{"login":"nightst4r","id":10628,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r","html_url":"https://github.com/nightst4r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2013-08-15T15:01:49Z","updated_at":"2014-07-11T02:56:40Z","closed_at":"2013-08-15T15:27:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/1943","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1943","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1943.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1943.patch"},"body":"Removing [Flags] From the Keys.cs enum as discussed in #1942\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1943/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1942","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1942/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1942/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1942/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1942","id":18092729,"number":1942,"title":"Left shift seems to be broken in DX?","user":{"login":"nightst4r","id":10628,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r","html_url":"https://github.com/nightst4r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2013-08-15T06:34:07Z","updated_at":"2013-08-15T15:01:49Z","closed_at":"2013-08-15T06:43:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"``` C#\n                case 0x2a: // LShift\n                    xnaKey = XnaKey.LeftShift;\n                    break;\n```\n\nFor some reason I can't understand, after that line is executed, it tells me the Key is Space | F17 ?

I don't think anyone wants to go to cap bits... even if they say they do.  This is what sucked about DX9 and what IMO still sucks about OpenGL.\n\nI could see expanding the existing `GraphicsProfile` to support more profiles:\n\n```\npublic enum GraphicsProfile\n{\n    XboxOne,\n    PlayStation4,                    \n    HiDef,\n    MidDef,\n    LowDef,\n    Reach,\n    Limited\n}\n```\n\nSome special platform specific profiles could be nice, but maybe sticking to more generic profiles is better?\n\nThe final option here is just mimicking the feature level concept from DirectX.  This is sort of what `GraphicsProfile` does albeit with only two levels.  Having it as a new separate enum just gives us some flexibility to break with the old system.\n\nWith either feature levels or profiles we will still need to look at all the different platforms MonoGame targets and all the hardware variations and make some calls as to how to decide how to categorize any particular hardware device.  We then need to clearly document these rules for developers.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1941/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1940","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1940/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1940/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1940/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1940","id":18059959,"number":1940,"title":"Fixed strange sound loading issue on MacOS","user":{"login":"WaaghMan","id":1774459,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1774459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WaaghMan","html_url":"https://github.com/WaaghMan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WaaghMan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WaaghMan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WaaghMan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WaaghMan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WaaghMan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WaaghMan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WaaghMan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WaaghMan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WaaghMan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2013-08-14T15:50:41Z","updated_at":"2017-04-24T18:39:11Z","closed_at":"2017-04-24T18:39:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/1940","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1940","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1940.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1940.patch"},"body":"Sometimes (Not sure why!)
