investigating #4413, I have noticed that OpenAL buffers were wrongly managed: every `SoundEffectInstance.Play()` a new buffer is created without freeing the previous one from the OpenAL context, and buffers are bound to one source at a time (buffer-source relationship is forced to be 1-1, instead of 1-multiple).\n\nThere is two problems with this: buffers are not reused, and they are not freed, which is causing #4413 to happen (the buffer limit is reached, and the number of 16 I mentioned is obviously wrong and was pure coincidence).\n\nThis PR does the following:\n- attaching a buffer to `SoundEffect` instead of `SoundEffectInstance` so they can be reused and don't depend on one single source (works like XAudio2)\n- removing source attachment from `OALSoundBuffer` so they are independent and only bound to a playing `SoundEffectInstance`\n- correctly disposing the buffers upon `SoundEffect.Dispose()`\n\nFixes #4413\nFixes #4411\nFixes #4403 \n\nWhile reviewing this PR, #4407 & #4410 should help getting rid of the remaining MacOS problems. (I'll most probably have to rebase them -- @tomspilman would you prefer that I push all these OpenAL changes in this present PR ?)\n\nWe've tested that extensively and it seems to work just fine. No leaks or runtime allocations to declare.\nSome good testing from other developers would be welcome (inc. on mobile). @dellis1972 @cra0zy @endimilojkoski\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI have updated this PR to make `OggStream` use the `OpenALSoundController` source pool. This will make sure that there is no conflict between `Song` and `SoundEffectInstance`. The source limit will now correctly be respected and the correct exception will be thrown if need be. This makes `OpenALSoundController` to be the one and only place where OpenAL sources are managed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4425","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4425/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4425/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4425/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4425","id":126686883,"number":4425,"title":"GraphicsDeviceManager

have a .mgcb project that references DLLs with custom content processors. When I load the project in the Pipeline tool the first time, I see one entry for each of my custom processors. When I reload the mgcb project (without closing the Pipeline tool), the custom processors are listed twice:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3626369/12325630/cf414ed8-bacb-11e5-82bb-972723663353.png)\n\nI have found the following cause: [PipelineType.cs](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop/Tools/Pipeline/Common/PipelineTypes.cs) collects the list of processors in [ResolveAssemblies()](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop/Tools/Pipeline/Common/PipelineTypes.cs#L398-L438). It first collects all processors of the assemblies which are currently loaded in the AppDomain. Then it collect all processors from the custom content pipeline DLLs referenced in the .mgcb.\nThis works the first time, but when the project is reloaded, the custom content pipeline DLLs are already loaded in the AppDomain and ResolveAssemblies() will find the same processors in both loops and add them twice.\n\nIn my projects this is only a bit irritating but no real problem. But could this be a problem if a user tests several .mgcb projects that use different versions of a custom content processor DLL?\n\nA quick fix would be to just ignore duplicate entries. Ideally, we want to unload custom content processor DLLs before loading the next project. However, I think it is currently not possible in .NET to unload DLLs. I think we can only unload whole AppDomains.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4424/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4423","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4423/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4423/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4423/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4423","id":126606983,"number":4423,"title":"Set correct permission to files before adding them to the deb package","user":{"login":"cra0zy","id":6773302,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6773302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy","html_url":"https://github.com/cra0zy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-01-14T08:49:28Z","updated_at":"2016-01-14T09:07:36Z","closed_at":"2016-01-14T09:07:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/4423","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4423","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4423.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4423.patch"},"body":"Do not merge\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4423/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4422","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4422/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4422/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4422/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4422","id":126575109,"number":4422,"title":"The package is of bad quality - monogame-sdk.deb","user":{"login":"aalvarado","id":370322,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/370322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalvarado","html_url":"https://github.com/aalvarado","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalvarado/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalvarado/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalvarado/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalvarado/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalvarado/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalvarado/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalvarado/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalvarado/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalvarado/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2016-01-14T04:31:33Z","updated_at":"2016-04-01T05:02:46Z","closed_at":"2016-04-01T05:02:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When attempting to install the monogame-sdk.deb in Ubuntu variant I'm presented with the message:\n\n> **The package is of bad quality**\n>  The installation of a package which violates the quality standards isn't allowed.

looks like the maximum of playing instances on all OpenAL platforms is set to 32 (`OpenALSoundController.MAX_NUMBER_OF_SOURCES`).\n\nHowever, this limit is not considered in `SoundEffect` which has its own `SoundEffect.MAX_PLAYING_INSTANCES` set to `int.MaxValue` (DesktopGL) or `256` (XamMac).\n\nThere is yet another constant in `SoundEffectInstancePool.MAX_PLAYING_INSTANCES`, but this one is never used. The `SoundEffectInstancePool` size is `SoundEffect.MAX_PLAYING_INSTANCES`.\n\nFix proposal:\n- set `SoundEffect.MAX_PLAYING_INSTANCES` to `OpenALSoundController.MAX_NUMBER_OF_SOURCES` on all OpenAL platforms and cleaning the duplicated / unused values;\n\nP.S.: unless explicitly documented, it is advised to set `OpenALSoundController.MAX_NUMBER_OF_SOURCES` to 32 (most modern hardware do 64, but for compatibility it is safer to stick to 32, and there is no way to query this limit by code).\n\nP.S. 2: `MediaPlayer` uses 1 unchecked source too, which means that the limit of 32 is wrong if the real hardware limit is 32 too.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4402","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4402/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4402/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4402/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4402","id":125619931,"number":4402,"title":"Screen scaled up on low-end Windows Phone 8.1 devices","user":{"login":"ebatiano","id":5548035,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5548035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebatiano","html_url":"https://github.com/ebatiano","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebatiano/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebatiano/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebatiano/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebatiano/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebatiano/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebatiano/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebatiano/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebatiano/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebatiano/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-01-08T14:13:45Z","updated_at":"2017-09-21T13:56:29Z","closed_at":"2017-09-21T13:56:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"On some devices (f.e.
