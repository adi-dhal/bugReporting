Looks like improper cast between OpenTK.Matrix4 and Xna.Matrix. Just added the extension method locally:\n\npublic static class MatrixConvert \n    {\n        public static Matrix ToXnaMatrix(this Matrix4 m) \n        {\n            return new Matrix(m.M11,m.M12,m.M13,m.M14,m.M21,m.M22,m.M23,m.M24,m.M31,m.M32,m.M33,m.M34,m.M41,m.M42,m.M43,m.M44);\n        }\n    }\n\nAnd then corrected the multiplications to use it:\n# if ANDROID\n\n```\n            lastDisplayOrientation = DisplayOrientation.Unknown;\n            UpdateWorldMatrixOrientation();\n```\n# else\n\n```\n            lastDisplayOrientation = graphicsDevice.PresentationParameters.DisplayOrientation;\n            matViewScreen = (Matrix4.CreateRotationZ((float)Math.PI)*\n                    Matrix4.CreateRotationY((float)Math.PI)*\n                    Matrix4.CreateTranslation(-this.graphicsDevice.Viewport.Width/2,\n                        this.graphicsDevice.Viewport.Height/2,\n                        1)).ToXnaMatrix(); // <---\n            matViewFramebuffer = Matrix4.CreateTranslation(-this.graphicsDevice.Viewport.Width/2,\n                        -this.graphicsDevice.Viewport.Height/2,\n                        1).ToXnaMatrix(); // <--\n            matProjection = Matrix4.CreateOrthographic(this.graphicsDevice.Viewport.Width,\n                        this.graphicsDevice.Viewport.Height,\n                        -1f,1f).ToXnaMatrix(); // <---\n\n            matWVPScreen = matViewScreen * matProjection;\n            matWVPFramebuffer = matViewFramebuffer * matProjection;\n```\n# endif\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/310","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/310/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/310/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/310/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/310","id":3313035,"number":310,"title":"update VideoPlayer constructor contract to match XNA 4","user":{"login":"urkle","id":101123,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/101123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/urkle","html_url":"https://github.com/urkle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urkle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urkle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urkle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urkle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urkle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urkle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urkle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urkle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urkle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2012-02-21T15:35:27Z","updated_at":"2014-07-11T12:40:18Z","closed_at":"2012-02-22T12:25:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/310","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/310","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/310.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/310.patch"},"body":"- use Game.Instance to get the \"game instance\"\n\n(this is from pull request #73 redone against current \"develop\" branch)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/310/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/309","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/309/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/309/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/309/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/309","id":3293752,"number":309,"title":"Fixed a Matrix issue with the Android SpriteBatch.cs","user":{"login":"dellis1972","id":810617,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/810617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972","html_url":"https://github.com/dellis1972","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2012-02-20T11:39:37Z","updated_at":"2014-07-11T01:47:01Z","closed_at":"2012-02-22T06:43:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/309","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/309","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/309.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/309.patch"},"body":"Fixed a Matrix issue with the Android SpriteBatch.cs .

In particular, addins for MD 2.8 on Mac would go in ~/Library/Application Support/MonoDevelop-2.8/Addins.
