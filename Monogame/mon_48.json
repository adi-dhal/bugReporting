need to plan how we want to approach supporting the new graphics APIs:  Vulkan, DirectX 12, and Metal.\n\nThese new APIs are more verbose and require more setup code to do similar things as previous graphics libraries.  This makes MonoGame even more useful to developers if we support them well.\n\nWe should consider this work in two steps:\n- Implement new graphics backends within our existing XNA style API.\n- Design and implement a new API that fits these new graphics standards.\n\nThe most immediate thing would be shoehorning these into our existing XNA style APIs.  There are potentially (I will know for sure soon) some performance benefits to be gained just by doing that.  Likely this will also require support in the content pipeline for new shader formats as well.\n\nThe next bigger step is designing a new graphics API for MonoGame that better aligns with Vulkan/DX12/Metal features.  It would be nice to support both this new API and our existing one at the same time, but we could just make a clean break if we feel confident about it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4570","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4570/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4570/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4570/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4570","id":136653891,"number":4570,"title":"Remove

This makes enlarging the width or the height make the data wrong, and method `GetPixelData` and `SetPixelData` prone to memory corruption.\n\nAlso looking at other siblings of `PixelBitmapContent`
