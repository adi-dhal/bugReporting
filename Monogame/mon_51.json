I have found a strange issue with the `Color` class. I'm using the latest dev build of MonoGame and made an entirely new Windows Game project to make sure something from my current project does not conflict with my code and cause this issue. Consider this code in `Game1.Draw(GameTime gameTime)`:\n\n`GraphicsDevice.Clear(new Color(231.0f, 214.0f, 90.0f, 1.0f));`\n\nAlthough there are `float` overloads for `Color`, when I debug the program the color is not similar to light yellow, but it is entirely white. But if I make these `int`egers, it works fine. [Here is a side-by-side comparison in a screenshot.](http://i.imgur.com/vlm17ZM.png) Is this actually a bug or an intended behavior? I'm not so familiar with MonoGame's code implementation for `Color`, but correct me if I'm wrong, aren't `float` Color values just rounded to match `int` values, e.g. `243.2f = 243`?? This could be useful if you are getting a `float` value from arithmetic division and the framework will convert it to `int` for you, but again I'm not sure what your code implementation is, and I'm assuming that was the purpose of the `float` overloads?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4481/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4480","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4480/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4480/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4480/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4480","id":130142129,"number":4480,"title":"High-Level classes for material, lights and shadows","user":{"login":"InfiniteProductions","id":16732089,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/16732089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/InfiniteProductions","html_url":"https://github.com/InfiniteProductions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/InfiniteProductions/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/InfiniteProductions/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/InfiniteProductions/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/InfiniteProductions/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/InfiniteProductions/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/InfiniteProductions/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/InfiniteProductions/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/InfiniteProductions/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/InfiniteProductions/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-01-31T15:48:00Z","updated_at":"2016-02-18T10:30:42Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I would like to suggest some addition MonoGame could offer, as IMHO, mimicking XNA with also its lacks and flaws would be a mistake.\n\nWorking with XNA for quite a while now, I'm just disappointed by the incredible lack of high-level interface to material and light stuff. By material I mean things like Unity offer, a combination of textures and shaders parameters to create very common material look (metal, glass, wood, stone) with diffuse, normal/bump map, spec map, alpha map eventually.\nAlso, it's even more incredible to see how time wasting/painful could be to add simple lights and shadow in XNA (there are too much samples in fact).\n\nMany people/companies tried and give-up now, leaving behind kind of junk-yard full of dead engines (Ploobs: not finished, full of annoying issues, SunBurn: dead, no way to get sourcecode, EngineNine: dead too, at least free and with source).\n\nIt's quite a shame XNA team never made anything, providing quite a high-level layer for basic 2D games is good (despite it doesn't include easy to use scrolling/camera/level building build-in features) but 3D is a lot more common and have more focus, I think, and all devs have to reinvent the wheel over and over every time for very basic things.\n\nSo, I would be really pleased to have some kind of BasicEffect class for common material settings, something like:\n\nMaterial wood = new Material (woodtexture, specmap);\n\nor \n\nMaterial rustymetal = new Material (metaltex, ... <other parameters here>);\n\nThe same for lights and shadows:\n\nLight point1 = new Light(Pointtype, position, intensity, color);\npoint1.castshadow = true;\npoint1.shadowtype = smooth;\n\ninstead of thousands of code lines + HLSL for shaders .\n(with an enum to specify light type or various constructors for point/spot lights).\n\nAs MG has to support many platform, it would need obviously to offer some way to the common features supported by all (the ONLY COMMON base), and very specific features (DX10/11 on windows for example) and perhaps a way to specify which PS/VS version caller want to use.\n\nBy the way, if such thing already exist, I'm really happy to see it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4479","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4479/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4479/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4479/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4479","id":130107297,"number":4479,"title":"Texture2D.FromStream cannot load tga files","user":{"login":"trommlbomml","id":1698003,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1698003?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trommlbomml","html_url":"https://github.com/trommlbomml","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trommlbomml/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trommlbomml/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trommlbomml/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trommlbomml/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trommlbomml/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trommlbomml/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trommlbomml/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trommlbomml/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trommlbomml/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":185445795,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/Help%20Wanted","name":"Help Wanted","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":32308879,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/Testing","name":"Testing","color":"e102d8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-01-31T09:42:38Z","updated_at":"2016-03-04T18:25:09Z","closed_at":"2016-03-04T18:25:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Reproducable with no problems in MonoGame 3.4.

I did a test program to try different fonts and the area reported by measurestring. and i get that the fonts JingJing and Lindsey from the redistributable package produce very similar results as shown here:\n![jing](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11319966/12584591/936b1908-c448-11e5-9d56-6f6c01ccdc50.gif)\n![linds](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11319966/12584592/94f06c7e-c448-11e5-93ed-0163d155fce9.gif)\nBut when using \"Trebuchet MS\" for example there are some problems as shown here:\n![trebu](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11319966/12584732/2ddfc146-c449-11e5-9fa7-4f04700914aa.gif)\nNotice the big difference in the black area (it's the reported size from measureString). And also i you zoom on the 'Ç' character you can see that it is drawn below the black box. The font has size 48, spacing 0, kerning, and character region goes from 32 to 256.\n\nThe size of each character compared to XNA is 1 pixel lower (61 to 62 for 'Ç', or 58 to 59 for 'Í') but that may come from the different rendering method, and the out of bounds drawing comes, if i have understood correctly the Freetype documentation, from the rounding of the hinting algorithm (the face reports a height of 74, with an ascender of 60 and a descender of 14, but 'Ç' has a descender of 15).\n\nI'm thinking that the way the fonts gets proccesed in each pipeline, is different, I'll try later to check if grabbing metrics for each character can provide different results.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4468/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4467","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4467/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4467/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4467/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4467","id":128752522,"number":4467,"title":"Target

This allows for platform specific audio formats to work as well as formats like PCM.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4462","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4462/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4462/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4462/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4462","id":128475579,"number":4462,"title":"Cleanup FX syntax for shader compiler","user":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/9","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestone/9","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/9/labels","id":1441958,"number":9,"title":"3.6 Release","description":"More unit tests, running unit tests on Mac and Linux, SDL2 replacing OpenTK.","creator":{"login":"dellis1972","id":810617,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/810617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972","html_url":"https://github.com/dellis1972","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":148,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-12-03T11:17:13Z","updated_at":"2017-08-21T16:42:53Z","due_on":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2017-03-09T08:22:27Z"},"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-01-25T06:59:58Z","updated_at":"2016-06-15T04:53:40Z","closed_at":"2016-03-31T08:33:44Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/4462","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4462","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4462.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4462.patch"},"body":"This PR uses the existing MGFX parser token tree to replace all FX syntax with whitespace.  This removes the FX syntax the system already parsed so that it isn't passed thru to the shader compiler step.
