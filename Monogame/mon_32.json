currently working on implementing a render batching pipeline for 3D rendering in Protogame, and I need some way of imitiating the \"Effect\" class without actually having the costs associated with it.  The current render context in the engine has an `Effect` property with the `Effect` type on it.\n\nIn particular, a lot of the code currently looks like:\n\n```\n\n// do some setup on effect, like setting parameter values etc.\n\nrenderContext.PushEffect(effect);\n\nsomeOtherApi.DoSomeRenderingWithCurrentEffect();\n```\n\nwhich internally then calls renderContext.Effect or whatever.\n\nI'd like to be able to have a fake Effect, one that the render batcher can provide which tracks all of the state changes made to the effect and it's parameters (like setting of textures and other values) as the game's render loop runs.\n\nOnce the render loop is about to finish, the render batcher would then look at all of the render requests that came through, sort them based on the most optimal way to run them (i.e. group requests where the effect and effect parameters are the same) and then push them to the GPU, reducing the number of draw calls to make.  I want to basically take the game render loop, which may render a whole bunch of different things with different effects, and combine them together into very few draw calls, potentially also making use of `DrawInstancedPrimitives` to reduce it even further.\n\nHowever, so much of the code is coupled to the Effect API, and because this is a concrete class, it makes it hard to use the API without incurring associated costs, or without the render batching having to clone the effect and it's parameters on every request (itself an expensive operation).\n\nI can't just switch out Effect with some other common API either, because it implements no interfaces, and I want render batching to be optional; if you don't want to use render batching, you shouldn't have to, so it's important that the effect setup can actually be a real effect when needed, and not a fake effect supplied by the render batcher for the purposes of tracking changes.\n\nMy proposal is to add an `IEffect` interface and potentially an `IEffectParameter` interface, where their signatures would match the current public APIs of the `Effect` and `EffectParameter` classes.  This would allow me to transparently replace effect with a fake tracking version as needed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5057/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5056","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5056/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5056/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5056/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5056","id":168740394,"number":5056,"title":"Fix

OpenGL\n**Version**: Latest commit and Release 3.5.1\n**Issue**: Destination offset is wrong, count is wrong\n**Reproducing**: This is a ~very~ specific case-scenario, but it can happen easily and there's no clear explanation of whats happening.\n\nIf you declare a float4x4 in your code and only use it to get a float3 result, it will become a float4x3 with a warning ( \"implicit truncation of vector type\" ).\nIssue is, now we don't have enough space to store float4x4 data (64 bytes), only 48 bytes.\n\nExample of the problem:\n\n```\nfloat4x4 World;\n\nfloat3 Position = mul(inPosition, World);\n```\n\nThis will build correctly though 2MGFX on OpenGL, but with a warning. When you apply the pass the data won't be able to be copied.\n\n**Solution**: \n1. Change float4x4 to float4x3 on everything that you won't need a float4 result.\nor\n2. Change \"implicit truncation of vector type\" from a warning to an error.\n\nThough it's a simple mistake, I think this can be a block to newcomers (riemers.net tutorials wouldn't work, for example, which is pretty much how I started learning HLSL).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5035/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5034","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5034/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5034/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5034/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5034","id":167816321,"number":5034,"title":"HiDef conflict with brga5551 fomate","user":{"login":"mahal907","id":612932,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/612932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahal907","html_url":"https://github.com/mahal907","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahal907/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahal907/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahal907/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahal907/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahal907/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahal907/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahal907/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahal907/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahal907/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-07-27T09:58:35Z","updated_at":"2016-07-27T09:58:35Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"When Profile is HiDef, new Texture2D(..., brga551) will cause an error in DirectX (0x80070057, E_INVALIDARG).

(This problem also applies to the y coordinate, of course.) This interferes, for example, with a simple UI library that uses the cursor position to determine whether the user is clicking on any elements; because then the clickable element really is somewhere else (and smaller) than it appears on the 1280 x 720 viewport that has been stretched to fit the screen as expected.\n\nPlatform is Windows 10 Home, x64, solution target is .NET 4.5, MG 3.5.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5032/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5031","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5031/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5031/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5031/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5031","id":167597837,"number":5031,"title":"MIT","user":{"login":"sirinath","id":637415,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/637415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirinath","html_url":"https://github.com/sirinath","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirinath/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirinath/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirinath/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirinath/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirinath/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirinath/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirinath/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirinath/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirinath/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-07-26T12:43:33Z","updated_at":"2016-07-26T12:44:46Z","closed_at":"2016-07-26T12:44:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"To be inline with rest of Mono is it possible to more to MIT?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5031/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5030","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5030/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5030/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5030/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5030","id":167586481,"number":5030,"title":"Fix Ogg Importer","user":{"login":"cra0zy","id":6773302,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6773302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy","html_url":"https://github.com/cra0zy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":12,"created_at":"2016-07-26T11:39:26Z","updated_at":"2016-07-28T19:44:17Z","closed_at":"2016-07-28T19:44:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/5030","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5030","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5030.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5030.patch"},"body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5030/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4892","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507242346","x-github-request-id":"AC6E:572B:D3062C:1BE1DEB:59D6A6C2","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=33>;
