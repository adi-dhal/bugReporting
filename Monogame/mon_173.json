fixes in this:\n\n1) In XNA, when the OnClientSizeChanged() has been called, the GraphicsDevice.Viewport field has been updated to the new bounds of the screen. It wasn't in MonoGame, so we need to set the viewport before triggering the callback. I know that the applychanges() below the code I've entered sets the viewport, but it needs to be done earlier so that clients can have access to the new viewport bounds as the callback happens. This change fixes that.\n\n2) Ray.Intersect(Plane) wasn't implemented correctly.

plane.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/818","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/818/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/818/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/818/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/818","id":7216096,"number":818,"title":"Fixed

This means, that we need to implement some new functions:\n\n```\nGetSupportedInterfaceOrientations\nShouldAutorotate\nPreferredInterfaceOrientationForPresentation\n```\n\nthese will be used instead of the function\n\n```\nShouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation\n```\n\non iOS 6.\n\nThere is also a change in the use of the info.plist's orientation settings: They always should be all but portrait upside down for iPhone, and all for iPad. If you don't match these settings and try to use gamecenter for example, your app will crash. This means that we need to depend on the XNA variable for supported resolutions, and drop the support for parsing the orientations from the Info.plist. Please note that this applies for XCode 4.5, even if building for iOS5! (drove me ntus)\n\nThis change also introduced a bug-like behaviour: Applications start with portrait resolutions, no matter what is set in the Info.plist, then it changes those back to normal accidentally. Some cocos developers referenced this as swapped width/height. Apple did not seem to care about this issue, so we need to adapt. This led to a number of cases where we end up working with the wrong resolutions.\n\nI would also like to note that iOS6 seemed to increase the trampoline type 2 usage, which resulted in our game crashing with default trampoline count.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/812","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/812/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/812/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/812/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/812","id":7132468,"number":812,"title":"Windows 8 - Issue with SoundEffectInstance","user":{"login":"jonathanpeppers","id":840039,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/840039?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanpeppers","html_url":"https://github.com/jonathanpeppers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanpeppers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanpeppers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanpeppers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanpeppers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanpeppers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanpeppers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanpeppers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanpeppers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanpeppers/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":185445795,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/Help%20Wanted","name":"Help Wanted","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/11","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestone/11","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/11/labels","id":1647175,"number":11,"title":"3.7 Release","description":"","creator":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":91,"closed_issues":85,"state":"open","created_at":"2016-03-16T04:39:49Z","updated_at":"2017-10-04T20:19:23Z","due_on":"2017-06-06T07:00:00Z","closed_at":null},"comments":6,"created_at":"2012-09-25T19:59:56Z","updated_at":"2017-03-09T08:22:52Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In XNA, if you call Play() on a SoundEffectInstance while it's playing--it does nothing.\n\nIn MonoGame/Windows 8, it stops the sound and starts it over.
