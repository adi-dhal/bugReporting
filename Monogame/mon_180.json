exception may happen on lots of other devices too, but it does not happen on my Novo Tornado tablet. The exception \"Java.Lang.RuntimeException: Can't create handler inside thread that has not called Looper.prepare()\" was thrown when \"new EditText(Game.Activity)\" was called.\n\nI fixed it by wrapping the whole AlertDialog creation in the Activity.RunOnUiThread invoker. I think it's probably better that it blocks the UI thread sooner rather than later anyway. Creating the AlertDialog can take a while on slower devices (> 1 sec), so blocking the UI thread may avoid users tapping stuff whilst the AlertDialog is being created. In the future we should consider whether the text entry AlertDialog should be pre-created and cached, or possibly just cached after the first creation.\n\nNote that the changes appear more radical than they are due to some white space cleanup.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/606/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/605","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/605/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/605/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/605/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/605","id":5752980,"number":605,"title":"updates

recently tried to build the latest version of develop3d on a linux platform (ubuntu 12.04) which produced a runtime error when attempting to create a spriteBatch instance.\n\nBoth MonoGame and my minimal game compile without any problems. But upon creation of a spriteBatch object in LoadContent: \n\n``` csharp\n        protected override void LoadContent()\n        {\n            spriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(GraphicsDevice);\n        }\n```\n\nI get the error message shown at the bottom of the page.\n\nNone of these problems occur when using my fork from 3 months ago (on my projects).\n\nIt's been quite some time since I've looked at any of the MonoGame code, but I'm happy to help sort this out if possible.\n\n---\n\nUnhandled Exception: System.InvalidOperationException: Shader Compilation Failed\n  at

default window title initialized in Game.cs doesn't match XNA's behavior when using a Game class inherited in another assembly.\n\nContext: I'm using my own library NuclearWinter which inherits Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game as NuclearGame. When I instantiate a NuclearGame, the resulting window in MonoGame is titled \"NuclearWinter\" instead of \"My Game's Name\".\n\nMonoGame's Game.cs uses GetCallingAssembly() which returns \"NuclearWinter\" instead of the actual game's name. GetEntryAssembly() seems to return the actual game's assembly.\n\nAs such, replacing:\n\n```\n        var assembly = Assembly.GetCallingAssembly();\n```\n\nby:\n\n```\n        var assembly = Assembly.GetEntryAssembly();\n```\n\nfixes the bug.\n\nI could have submitted a patch but I figured it wasn't worth it for this one-liner.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/592/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/591","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/591/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/591/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/591/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/591","id":5645167,"number":591,"title":"Develop3d - Android: Fix dynamic orientation and merge in lock screen changes from develop branch","user":{"login":"Aranda","id":1129912,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1129912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aranda","html_url":"https://github.com/Aranda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aranda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aranda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aranda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aranda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aranda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aranda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aranda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aranda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aranda/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/3","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestone/3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/3/labels","id":90740,"number":3,"title":"3.0 Release","description":"","creator":null,"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":98,"state":"closed","created_at":"2012-03-01T08:54:38Z","updated_at":"2013-09-24T05:36:54Z","due_on":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2013-09-24T05:36:54Z"},"comments":1,"created_at":"2012-07-16T17:44:20Z","updated_at":"2014-07-11T04:01:51Z","closed_at":"2012-07-17T13:17:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/591","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/591","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/591.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/591.patch"},"body":"Initially I intended to just make the Orientation sample function as it does in develop branch, however this was harder than expected and I ended up reworking the way orientation changes are handled. I also included Dean's recent ScreenReceiver and associated changes from develop branch. \n\nNotes:\n- GraphicsDeviceManager.ApplyChanges() can now do stuff. In particular it updates presentation parameters and triggers orientation changes if the current orientation becomes unsupported.\n- GraphicsDeviceManager.ResetClientBounds() has been taken from develop and modified. It correctly updates the Viewport now. It attempts to ensure you are always working with the preferred aspect ratio, but it does not modify the buffer size. It's debatable how useful preserving the aspect ratio across orientation changes is. Particularly so when the aspect ratio is implied by the preferred buffer W & H and some devices with only soft keys on the task bar change aspect on orientation change.\n- AndroidGameWindow now implements ISurfaceHolderCallback.SurfaceChanged as a means of delaying the response to orientation change until it's fully propogated.\n- Cleaned up some code in Game.cs. I know some of this not Android specific, but I believe non-Android actual functionality is not affected (remember ResetClientBounds() used to be empty on develop3d).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/591/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/590","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/590/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/590/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/590/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/590","id":5640915,"number":590,"title":"develop3d- Threaded texture loading support for Windows and Linux","user":{"login":"KonajuGames","id":694943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/694943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames","html_url":"https://github.com/KonajuGames","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2012-07-16T14:51:22Z","updated_at":"2014-07-11T10:53:46Z","closed_at":"2012-07-16T14:56:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/590","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/590","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/590.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/590.patch"},"body":"Using a shared GL context for the background threads, similar to the iOS approach.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/590/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4744","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507242346","x-github-request-id":"BEC4:572B:D3FB2C:1C02839:59D6A9BA","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=181>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=200>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=179>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"3d433902b15bfd892076ea49d8b5f956\"","status":"200 OK"}}
