two commits commit code that will help prevent some issues on Windows 7 and Ouya/Android devices.\n\nWindows 7: The issue comes from attempting to get the Object Volume pointer, to handle control of the volume.  This is a Ugly hack, that originates from HardyCore77 on Codeplex Discussions (https://monogame.codeplex.com/discussions/453847).\n\nOuya/Android: I believe this error also occurs on Android, but I have only encountered it so far on Ouya.  When utilizing RenderTarget2D Class to create a Buffered Bitmap for drawing Sliced UI Elements, when going into the Game Play section, the system will at random execution times, stop running, while spaming the output on the console window, showing that Some object was not a Valid Reference.  I have traced it down to being the GraphicsDevice not being properly assigned when Dispose() is being called.  This simply runs a check to see if this.GraphicsDevice is valid, and not null, before attempting to execute the PlatformDeleteRenderTarget() method.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2979","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2979/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2979/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2979/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2979","id":42495262,"number":2979,"title":"Add link to RB Whitaker's XNA tutorials, loads of XNA / Monogame in the documentation","user":{"login":"davidglassborow","id":55509,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/55509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidglassborow","html_url":"https://github.com/davidglassborow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidglassborow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidglassborow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidglassborow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidglassborow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidglassborow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidglassborow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidglassborow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidglassborow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidglassborow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-09-11T07:07:46Z","updated_at":"2014-09-11T08:17:34Z","closed_at":"2014-09-11T07:48:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/2979","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2979","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2979.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2979.patch"},"body":"It's a great list of tutorials ( it is linked from the bottom of his MonoGame tutorials but I missed it the first time, and it covers a lot that is very useful for beginning with MG right up to advanced stuff.\n- Game loop including fixed and variable time\n- 2D\n- 3D\n- Shaders and HLSL\n  etc.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2978","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2978/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2978/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2978/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2978","id":42452979,"number":2978,"title":"SpriteBatch disregardes floating point values","user":{"login":"jamesford42","id":155688,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/155688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesford42","html_url":"https://github.com/jamesford42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesford42/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesford42/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesford42/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesford42/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesford42/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesford42/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesford42/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesford42/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesford42/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":185445795,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/Help%20Wanted","name":"Help Wanted","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2014-09-10T19:52:24Z","updated_at":"2015-04-27T20:25:10Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"SpriteBatch draw methods which take a Vector2 position and/or a Vector2 scale are actually snapping to pixel coordinates prior to rendering (rounding to integers). \n\nMy recollection of XNA behavior, which probably needs to be verified, is that this was not the case. As I recall having to add 'round' calls to all positions passed in to DrawString or the text would be very blurry otherwise. \n\nNevertheless, not having the 'ability' to render with subpixel precision is a serious problem for smoothly scaling / positioning of a sprite. If you want to round to integers, use the rectangle api or round it yourself prior to calling draw. If you pass in a position or size with floating point precision spritebatch should assume it was intentional and obey it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2978/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2977","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2977/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2977/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2977/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2977","id":42372386,"number":2977,"title":"XAct Improvements 5","user":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-09-10T02:36:45Z","updated_at":"2015-04-29T11:35:36Z","closed_at":"2014-09-10T02:52:51Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/2977","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2977","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2977.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2977.patch"},"body":"This PR has a bunch of improvements to XAct playback accuracy:\n- Decoded and implemented volume events with both replacement and additive modes.\n- Fixed incorrect randomized volumes in `PlayWaveEvent`s.\n- The `XactSound` volume is now being applied.\n- Moved all event playback timing to occur within `XactClip`.\n- `XactClip` now keeps track of playback state during updates.\n- Replaced the various `Volume` set/get properties with more obvious methods.\n- Did a bunch of cleanup in `Cue`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2977/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2976","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2976/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2976/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2976/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2976","id":42325029,"number":2976,"title":"Windows Phone 8.1 -
