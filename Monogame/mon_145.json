This is because internally GraphicsDevice keeps ahold of the RenderTargetBinding array we passed to it.  This means when we set it the second time the arrays are already equal... we then early out without changing the render target.\n\nThe second bug was this...\n\n```\ndevice.SetRenderTarget(target1);\nvar bindings = device.GetRenderTargets();\nbindings[0] = new RenderTargetBinding(target2);\ndevice.SetRenderTargets(bindings);\nDrawToTarget();\n```\n\nLike the code above... `target2` is not rendered to.  This is because `GetRenderTargets()` returns the internal `_currentRenderTargetBindings` array...  which then we modify.  Again when we call `SetRenderTargets` the arrays are equal in value and no render target change occurs.\n\nTo solve this i made the following changes...\n- _currentRenderTargetBindings is a fixed sized array and never null.\n- Added _currentRenderTargetCount to keep track of the count of bound render targets. \n- GetRenderTargets() now returns copy of the bindings array.\n- ApplyRenderTargets() now copies the incoming binding array elements.\n\nI know there have been other render target bugs reported lately...  not sure if my changes here resolve some of them as well.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1666/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1665","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1665/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1665/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1665/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1665","id":13386554,"number":1665,"title":"PSM solution doesn't compile","user":{"login":"matthargett","id":1550766,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1550766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthargett","html_url":"https://github.com/matthargett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthargett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthargett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthargett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthargett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthargett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthargett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthargett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthargett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthargett/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":15,"created_at":"2013-04-19T04:16:25Z","updated_at":"2014-04-29T02:11:50Z","closed_at":"2014-04-29T02:11:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The PSM solution/projects currently don't compile due to some very odd code.

We had lots of places where the List<> had one element in it...  but under the hood List<> allocates in chunks.  So you would have this totally unused memory floating around in largely empty lists.\n\nSecond I switched to explicit Clone() methods for the collections instead of constructors.  This allows for example to EffectAnnotationCollection.Clone() to return a shared \"empty\" collection instead of allocating a new one.  This also saved alot of memory as we have a lot of empty collections in Effects.\n\nMy test was allocating 10,000 BasicEffect objects and measuring the system memory using the GC methods.\n\nBefore: 87MB\nAfter: 61MB\n\nSo overall a 29% reduction in memory usage.  \n\nStill each BasicEffect eats up 6K of memory each... which is sort of fat IMO.\n\nMy goal moving forward is to reduce this even greater, but this will take some deeper changes to how EffectParameter and EffectPass work.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1660/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1659","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1659/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1659/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1659/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1659","id":13211493,"number":1659,"title":"Support For Signed Numbers in MGFX","user":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-04-15T17:49:44Z","updated_at":"2014-07-11T04:39:35Z","closed_at":"2013-04-21T14:32:41Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/1659","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1659","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1659.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1659.patch"},"body":"This adds support for signed numbers in both render states and sampler states in an MGFX file.\n\nIt is a fix for #1653.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1659/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1658","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1658/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1658/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1658/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1658","id":13202073,"number":1658,"title":"Xamarin Android update to 4.6.3 causes Android samples to crash","user":{"login":"FWJay","id":555988,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/555988?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FWJay","html_url":"https://github.com/FWJay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FWJay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FWJay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FWJay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FWJay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FWJay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FWJay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FWJay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FWJay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FWJay/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2013-04-15T14:25:50Z","updated_at":"2014-04-29T02:23:03Z","closed_at":"2014-04-29T02:23:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Suddenly started facing a new error when Xamarin Android was updated to 4.6.3, with the message\n\nError   148 The \"ResourceNameCaseMap\" parameter is not supported by the \"AndroidComputeResPaths\" task.

This leads to a bad user interface experience and strange \"stuck\" touch problems.\n\nLooking into it, I think it is very similar to this dicussion which is closed:\n\nhttps://github.com/mono/MonoGame/issues/770\n\nFrom debugging our problem we saw that on this particular hardware, leaving your finger down for a short amount of time builds up A LOT of touch \"move\" events on touch panel.  Given that only one touch event is \"popped\" from the event queue each time TouchPanel.GetState() is called and we only call GetState() once a frame (to see whats new since last frame) it ends up taking over 100 frames to plow through all the built up \"moves\" and eventually get to the \"release\" event.\n\nWe ended up making this change to fix the issue for our purposes:\n\nhttps://github.com/FourBrosStudio/MonoGame/commit/b2407ba45a8ce8c44764e94c8f859e839bf4785d\n\nSo basically it works the same as before except it will skip over all \"move\" events that aren't the last one and ignore \"move\" if there is a \"release\" after it.  This is more in line with the way XNA behaves on Windows Phone.  It also means that you _will_ lose information when many moves come in a single frame so an app that wants to do precise line drawing with a finger will need to use the FreeDrag gesture instead of relying on GetState which is more like a snapshot (same as XNA on Windows Phone).\n\nBut the benefit is that it doesn't take 3+ seconds to process a finger being lifted.\n\nHas anyone else hit this issue and what are some alternative work arounds?  We are comfortable with this change and are using it going forward but I'm not sure if there was an intentional reason to queue up move events like it was doing before.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1646/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1645","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1645/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1645/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1645/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1645","id":13092950,"number":1645,"title":"DXT and PVRTC Mipmap Generation","user":{"login":"RayBatts","id":1228707,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1228707?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts","html_url":"https://github.com/RayBatts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2013-04-11T22:24:34Z","updated_at":"2014-07-11T04:42:08Z","closed_at":"2013-04-15T13:51:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/1645","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1645","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1645.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1645.patch"},"body":"Note that this won't generate mipmaps for uncompressed textures.
