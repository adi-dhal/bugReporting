and *Rectangle.Empty* should be corrected, as using either of these could lead to bugs via false negatives.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation is:\r\n```\r\n/// <summary>\r\n/// Whether or not this <see cref=\"Rectangle\"/> has a <see cref=\"Width\"/> and\r\n/// <see cref=\"Height\"/> of 0, and a <see cref=\"Location\"/> of (0, 0).\r\n/// </summary>\r\npublic bool IsEmpty\r\n{\r\n    get\r\n    {\r\n        return ((((this.Width == 0) && (this.Height == 0)) && (this.X == 0)) && (this.Y == 0));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAccording to this, for a *Rectangle* to be considered empty, both it's width *and* its height **must** equal 0 **and** both its X and Y positions **must** equal 0.\r\n\r\nFor a Rectangle to actually be empty, all that is required is that *either* its width **or** height equal 0. Its X or Y positions have no effect on this. A rectangle could have a height of *int.MaxValue* but if its width is 0, its still an empty triangle containing a no space. Essentially it would just be a line with no volume. It also doesn't matter if an empty Rectangle is located in the top-left of screen or the bottom-right; empty is still empty.\r\n\r\nA correct implementation of *Rectangle.IsEmpty* would be:\r\n```\r\npublic bool IsEmpty\r\n{\r\n    get { return Width == 0 || Height == 0; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI realize this is legacy dragged along from XNA but regardless, its still incorrect and bugged against what should be expected behavior.\r\n\r\nThis also applies to the *Rectangle.Empty* constant which really shouldn't be labeled the definitive state of an empty Rectangle. As mentioned above, the X and Y positions have no context in whether it is empty and only a width **or** height of 0 indicate emptiness. Removing or renaming the *Rectangle.Empty* constant could be a breaking change to anyone compiled against it to determine emptiness in their code which sucks but if they're depending on this being the only form of an empty rectangle possible than their code is already bugged.\r\n\r\nAny chance on a pull request to correct this or any thoughts against a PR for this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5833/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5832","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5832/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5832/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5832/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5832","id":244797236,"number":5832,"title":"Fixes
