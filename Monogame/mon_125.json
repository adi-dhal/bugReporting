I have seen it myself on a custom AMDx86 tablet but on AtivTab is not visible. Others has seen it on Surface Pro and XPS10. \nThis comment mono#2113 has been very helpful to track down this bug. It has been speculated that it is due to drivers firing events faster, or that on slow machines events are not consumed as fast. I would like to add the possibility that the quality of the touch screen might be a factor to why we see that on some devices and not on others. The better/more accurate a touch screen is, the more visible this bug is.\n\nI had to close the previews PR f63da1f and resend after the recent changes on TouchPanel/TouchPanelState.\n\nI will try to explain this as briefly as possible. \nTouchPanelState.Refresh(...) is always called inside a while \"ex. (touchPanelState.Refresh(...) ) {...}\" by making the assumption that this functions returns false when there are no more events to process. \nThis function, for every preview touch id, goes through the event list and tries to find the first event with the same id, remove it, and break the loop. Then continues on with the next id and finally with the rest of the program.\nIn case the event hasn't changed position from last time and there are no other real events, stateChanged remains always =false and the function returns false. This breaks the caller's While() loop and wont be called until the next frame. The problem is that it removes one nonmoving event at a time while the list accumulate similar events for that id. \nThe fix is that we keep removing events of that id, as long as stateChanged==false, which is all nonmoving events we can find until we reach a real touch event.\nThe j-- of course adjust the j indexer after the removal of one element.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2265","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2265/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2265/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2265/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2265","id":28995420,"number":2265,"title":"Hide statusbar for iOS 7 or newer if game is fullscreen","user":{"login":"Nezz","id":431167,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/431167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz","html_url":"https://github.com/Nezz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":12,"created_at":"2014-03-07T20:21:54Z","updated_at":"2014-07-07T17:52:51Z","closed_at":"2014-03-26T20:07:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/2265","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2265","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2265.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2265.patch"},"body":"This was previously discussed in #2260\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2264","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2264/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2264/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2264/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2264","id":28963508,"number":2264,"title":"On Android, rapid switching between home screen and game causes deadlock over ContentManagerLock","user":{"login":"jbeshir","id":528031,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/528031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbeshir","html_url":"https://github.com/jbeshir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbeshir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbeshir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbeshir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbeshir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbeshir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbeshir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbeshir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbeshir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbeshir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-03-07T13:00:36Z","updated_at":"2014-03-07T13:58:33Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In attempting to track down a hanging on resume problem on Android in our software, I believe I have identified an issue with content reloading on that platform.\n\nIt appears that if you switch out of a game on Android while it is still reloading content, then switch back into it quickly, there is often a second call to CreateFrameBuffer() in AndroidGameWindow while _isResuming is already true and there is already a background thread reloading content.\n\nThis means that it starts a new background thread reloading content, but resumes the game as soon as the old background thread completes and sets _isResuming to false. This causes the game to resume running while content is still being reloaded in the new background thread.\n\nSince the background thread for reloading content runs holding ContentManagerLock and invokes the UI thread, if the UI thread attempts to create a new ContentManager while in this state (and thus attempts to acquire the ContentManagerLock), this can cause a deadlock and the game to hang.\n\nIf helpful, I could try to create a small project replicating the hanging behaviour. A multicore test device might be needed. I am not sure about appropriate solutions; for this particular hanging issue it might be sufficient to just ensure _isResuming doesn't become false until all background threads reloading content are finished, but there could be other issues with raising OnDeviceReset while reloading content is still ongoing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2263","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2263/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2263/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2263/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2263","id":28910800,"number":2263,"title":"RenderTarget2d as shader sampler iOS","user":{"login":"euphoria3k","id":1061656,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1061656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/euphoria3k","html_url":"https://github.com/euphoria3k","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/euphoria3k/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/euphoria3k/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/euphoria3k/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/euphoria3k/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/euphoria3k/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/euphoria3k/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/euphoria3k/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/euphoria3k/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/euphoria3k/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2014-03-06T20:16:24Z","updated_at":"2014-03-20T12:23:13Z","closed_at":"2014-03-20T12:23:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Anyone have any success passing a rendertarget2d into a shader as a texture to sample (ie a light mask), specifically on iOS?

Eliminate confusing #ifdef-elif-elif branching\n2. Separate platform-specific code while maintaining asserts/exceptions common to all\n3. Avoid the performance hit of a base class and virtual methods\n\nThe first thing I did was to go through and eliminate nested #elif and catchall #else directives, with each API side by side in its own #if-#endif block. Since you would never have both OPENGL and DIRECTX defined, this is fine and it'd rightly fail to compile if you tried. This is probably worth doing even if we didn't go through with the other steps.\n\nNext I isolated all in-method #if'd logic into methods called Platform{MethodName}. For example, PlatformDrawIndexedPrimitives. Assertions and exceptions common to all APIs stay in the main file to ensure runtime consistency.\n\nFinally, I copied the file out three times, one for each API. Then I eliminated all platform-specific code from the main file, and all non-platform code from the copies. After switching the definition to a partial class in all files, everything compiles normally.\n\nUsing partial classes and chaining allows us to completely separate the APIs with only the overhead of a regular (non-virtual) method call. The process of porting is simply a matter of creating a new partial class file with the Platform\\* methods in it and adding it to the project file. If the ported file is missing or a Platform method isn't defined, the build fails and it's very easy to see where.\n\nI recommend fetching the changes locally to inspect them side-by-side so it's easier to see what's going on.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2242","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2242/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2242/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2242/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2242","id":27963882,"number":2242,"title":"RenderTarget2D - GL DeleteRenderbuffers error when DepthFormat.None","user":{"login":"azchohfi","id":527713,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/527713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi","html_url":"https://github.com/azchohfi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2014-02-20T14:10:47Z","updated_at":"2014-03-26T19:37:50Z","closed_at":"2014-03-26T19:37:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm not 100% sure of this, so I would like to know others opinions...\n\nI'm creating a few RenderTarget2D and some of them are using DepthFormat.None.
