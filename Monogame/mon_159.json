I've managed to get the custom shader converted, loading, effect applied under Win8. Hopefully the final hurdle is just this draw call.  I had a look at implementing it myself, but have no clue what I'm doing this low level in the framework.\n\nIn case it's useful, here is my converted sample shader below... (note: i needed to change the sample's Short2's to Vector2's, and semantics a little to get this loading/applying in win8 rt. this also meant matching changes to the sample's ParticleVertex,cs)\n\nTexture2D < float4 > Texture : register ( t0 ) ; sampler TextureSampler : register ( s0 ) ; \n\ncbuffer Parameters : register ( b0 ) { \n\n```\nfloat4x4 View;\nfloat4x4 Projection;\nfloat2 ViewportScale;\n\nfloat CurrentTime;\n\nfloat Duration;\nfloat DurationRandomness;\nfloat3 Gravity;\nfloat EndVelocity;\nfloat4 MinColor;\nfloat4 MaxColor;\n\nfloat2 RotateSpeed;\nfloat2 StartSize;\nfloat2 EndSize;\n```\n\n} ; \n\nstruct VSInputTx \n{ \n    float2 Corner : SV_Position;\n    float3 Pos : NORMAL0;\n    float3 Velocity : NORMAL1;\n    float4 Random : COLOR0;\n    float Time : TEXCOORD0;\n} ; \n\nstruct VSOutputTx \n{ \n    float4 Pos : SV_Position;\n    float4 Color : COLOR0;\n    float2 TextureCoordinate : COLOR1;\n} ; \n\n//Original structs...\n//struct VSInputTx \n//{ \n//    float2 Corner : POSITION0;\n//    float3 Position : POSITION1;\n//    float3 Velocity : NORMAL0;\n//    float4 Random : COLOR0;\n//    float Time : TEXCOORD0;\n//} ; \n//\n//struct VSOutputTx \n//{ \n//    float4 Position : POSITION0;\n//    float4 Color : COLOR0;\n//    float2 TextureCoordinate : COLOR1;\n//} ; \n\n// Vertex shader helper for computing the position of a particle.\nfloat4 ComputeParticlePosition(float3 position, float3 velocity,\n                               float age, float normalizedAge)\n{\n    float startVelocity = length(velocity);\n\n```\n// Work out how fast the particle should be moving at the end of its life,\n// by applying a constant scaling factor to its starting velocity.\nfloat endVelocity = startVelocity * EndVelocity;\n\n// Our particles have constant acceleration, so given a starting velocity\n// S and ending velocity E, at time T their velocity should be S + (E-S)*T.\n// The particle position is the sum of this velocity over the range 0 to T.\n// To compute the position directly, we must integrate the velocity\n// equation.

An oriented render target was provided for rendering and all input was rotated.\n\nIn Windows 8 Store apps it is also done automatically for you by default as well.  You get an oriented render target and input is rotated.  The docs do however provide some additional insight when using automatic rotation:\n\n> \"It performs a redundant full screen copy operation.\"\n> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/jj262112.aspx\n\nSo this is telling us automatic works, but it is costing us some fillrate doing a copy.\n\nThis means that even on WinRT there is some savings to not using automatic rotation.  They recommend what has been mentioned before... append the rotation to your projection matrix.  Here is a good example of implementing this for WP8:\n\nhttp://www.catalinzima.com/2012/12/handling-orientation-in-a-windows-phone-8-game/\n\nWhere does this leave MonoGame?  I think we have to do two things:\n\n1 - Provide the automatic method using an offscreen render target with an efficient copy.\n\nThis would not only be a feature for WP8, but we can possibly use it to also support scaling of the backbuffer on Android as well.\n\n2 - Add support for matrix level rotation.\n\nWe can add some flag in GraphicsDevice or GraphicsDeviceManager that hints to the system that we want to opt-out of automatic rotation.  We would expose something like GraphicsDevice.ScreenRotationMatrix.  Under the hood stock Effects and SpriteBatch would use this automatically...  so most games won't care.  If you are using a custom effect you would have to add this explicitly into your projection.\n\nThese two features should cover us no matter the platform moving forward with minimal pain to end users.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1226","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1226/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1226/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1226/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1226","id":10277982,"number":1226,"title":"AccessViolationException

I made a similar PR over at the now old WinDX repo: https://github.com/SickheadGames/MonoGame/pull/12 but didn't know how to move the PR over to this repo, so I made a new PR and changed some more things.\n\nThe reason why I changed IsMouseVisible is because the current implementation seemed a bit hackish and didn't work well.\n\nSomeone please test the IsMouseVisible property on
