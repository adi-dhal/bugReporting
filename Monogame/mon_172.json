So if(dragH) needs to be followed up with an else if(dragV)\n\nhopefully this is the most appropriate place to bring this to your attention.\n\nEDIT:\n\nswapping the if statement to if(dragH || dragV)

haven't gotten to the bottom of this one yet, but basically sampler states aren't being applied properly when the active texture has changed.\n\nI use SampleState.PointClamp for rendering CraftStudio's low-poly, pixelated models.\n\nWhen I change the texture bound to my \"textureSampler\" parameter (which should be called Texture, but that is another story ;) #641), and then apply my effect, the sampler state isn't properly applied and I get the default interpolation filter (linear & wrap I think) instead of what I requested (point & clamp).\n\nThis means that the very first model to be rendered in my scene (with texture 1) has proper texture sampling, and then all subsequent models (with textures 2, 3, 4 ...) are linearly interpolated.\n\nDisabling the _dirty checks in SamplerStateCollection.SetSamplers() fixes the issue, so my guess is the dirty bit flag isn't being set when it should in some cases. I'll report back later if I find a proper fix.\n\n(Obviously this works correctly in XNA)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/842/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/841","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/841/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/841/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/841/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/841","id":7355338,"number":841,"title":"MonoMacGameView has 16-bit depth size instead of 24-bit like XNA","user":{"login":"elisee","id":446986,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/446986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elisee","html_url":"https://github.com/elisee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elisee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elisee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elisee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elisee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elisee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elisee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elisee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elisee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elisee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2012-10-04T16:10:40Z","updated_at":"2016-01-08T12:15:49Z","closed_at":"2016-01-08T12:15:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The title says it all: the pixel format used by MonoMacGameView has a depth size of 16-bit instead of 24-bit like XNA, which may cause z-fighting (and does in my case).\n\nThe 16-bit depth size is hard-coded in https://github.com/mono/monomac/blob/master/src/OpenGL/MonoMacGameView.cs#L66 so I guess someone should submit a pull request there to make it customizable?

Android port went smoothly, IOS seems to be having trouble loading spritefonts.  It loads a normal texture2d fine right before the load call that errors.  I'm giving it the XNB file for the spritefont but it doesn't seem to like the format its in.  I even tried giving it a gamefont.xnb from one of the samples to see what that would do and no luck.  Says its looking for CompressedRGBAPVRTC2B.\n\nShould maybe also mention i'm using Gamestatemanagementsample as the base for the game.\n\nlines leading up to the problem.\n\n```\nprotected override void LoadContent()\n        {\n            // Load content belonging to the screen manager.\n            ContentManager content = Game.Content;\n\n            spriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(GraphicsDevice);\n            blankTexture = content.Load<Texture2D>(\"blank\");\n            font = content.Load<SpriteFont>(\"menufont\");\n```\n\nI'm new to monogame.
