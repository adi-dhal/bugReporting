I was thinking that using this for browser support may make more sense than using NaCl since this would be cross browser.\n\nhttps://github.com/kevingadd/JSIL\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1422/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1421","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1421/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1421/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1421/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1421","id":11135588,"number":1421,"title":"MonoGame Wikipedia Page","user":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":84,"created_at":"2013-02-18T23:32:13Z","updated_at":"2013-09-11T08:57:25Z","closed_at":"2013-09-11T08:57:25Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"We need someone to author a proper page on Wikipedia for MonoGame.  \n\nThe article should properly follow all Wikipedia guidelines and look as polished as other software articles:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_(software)\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework\n\nThere currently exists a redirect to the XNA page:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MonoGame\n\nAlso make sure to link MonoGame to the XNA page here:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA#Alternative_implementations\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1420","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1420/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1420/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1420/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1420","id":11135096,"number":1420,"title":"Added MaxTextureSize to GraphicsDevice","user":{"login":"SamuelEnglard","id":1119883,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1119883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamuelEnglard","html_url":"https://github.com/SamuelEnglard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamuelEnglard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamuelEnglard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamuelEnglard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamuelEnglard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamuelEnglard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamuelEnglard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamuelEnglard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamuelEnglard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamuelEnglard/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":22,"created_at":"2013-02-18T23:12:53Z","updated_at":"2014-06-15T13:25:20Z","closed_at":"2013-02-19T08:00:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/1420","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1420","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1420.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1420.patch"},"body":"In XNA Textures can be larger than the screen (though there is a\nmaximum size) while in OpenGL they can't.

The high resolution levels are ok, but some low resolution levels do not contain valid data - instead they contain only black (all bytes are 0). I think the problem is that all mipmap levels where the resolution is not a multiple of 4 (which is the DXT block width) are not set correctly. For example, a mipmap level with 120x60 texels is okay. The next mipmap level with 60x30 texels and all following mipmap levels contain only black. \n\nTo quickly reproduce the problem, load any texture with mipmaps where the texture format is DxtCompressed. Draw the image with a sprite batch and use a mipmap level bias (e.g. 0, 1, 2, 3, ..) to view a specific mipmap level:\n\n``` C#\n_spriteBatch.Begin(\n        SpriteSortMode.Immediate, \n        BlendState.AlphaBlend, \n        new SamplerState { Filter = TextureFilter.Point, MipMapLevelOfDetailBias = _mipMapBias,  }, \n        DepthStencilState.None, \nRasterizerState.CullNone);\n_spriteBatch.Draw(_texture, new Vector2(0, 0), Color.White);\n_spriteBatch.End();\n```\n\nHere is another test: \u000bLet's assume that the mipmap level 7 is 1x1. Write some bytes with _texture.SetData(). Then read the bytes with _texture.GetData() and compare them. GetData() will only return zeros.\n\n``` C#\nbyte[] desiredData = new byte[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, };\nbyte[] actualData = new byte[desiredData.Length];\n_texture.SetData(7, null, desiredData, 0, desiredData.Length);\n_texture.GetData(7, null, actualData, 0, actualData.Length);   \nbool areEqual = actualData.SequenceEqual(desiredData);\n```\n\nThe above code works with XNA but does not work in a Windows desktop MonoGame project with DirectX 11 or in a Windows Store App.\nThe problem occurs with opaque and transparent textures and also with power-of-two textures.\nMy current workaround is to avoid DXT compression.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1414","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1414/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1414/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1414/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1414","id":11114307,"number":1414,"title":"[WinGL/Linux] Window to center","user":{"login":"xanather","id":3013922,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3013922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xanather","html_url":"https://github.com/xanather","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xanather/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xanather/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xanather/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xanather/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xanather/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xanather/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xanather/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xanather/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xanather/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":12,"created_at":"2013-02-18T13:15:24Z","updated_at":"2016-03-17T03:59:19Z","closed_at":"2016-03-17T03:59:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The WinGL/Linux window is not in the center when it is initially displayed.

The AndroidGameWindow._isResuming is set so the optional IResumeManager can be drawn. A default ResumeManager implementation has been provided so users can easily set it up with a custom texture rotating in the middle of the screen.\n\n**Motivation**\nReloading of textures can take a LONG time. Whilst this occurs the user is presented with a black screen and the music playing. This leads to confusion about whether the game may have crashed. Also, when adding full screen ads to a game, these generally cause the GL context to be lost, so when the user dismisses the ad, they are hit with this lengthy texture reload each time.\n\n**Usage**\n\n```\n// Create your own implementation of IResumeManager or simply use the\n// default one. Place this code in your Game.Initialize() or somewhere similar\n#if ANDROID\n            AndroidGameWindow droidWindow = this.Window as AndroidGameWindow;\n            droidWindow.SetResumer(new ResumeManager(this.Services,\n                                                     spriteBatch,\n                                                     @\"UI\\Resuming\",\n                                                     1.0f, // Default scale\n                                                     0.02f // Rotate speed\n                                                     ));\n#endif\n```\n\nOriginal pull request in case someone wanted to check the comment history: https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/pull/1093\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1400/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4771","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507242346","x-github-request-id":"A494:572C:157D75C:2AAF35F:59D6A955","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=154>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=200>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=152>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"05ce8f7f75477423b84c6e2b6d93cd1e\"","status":"200 OK"}}
