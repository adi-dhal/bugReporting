This likely requires someone familiar with the Monogame rendering pipeline._\n\nDuring the Draw section of my game, there's a ShadowmapResolver that renders out a texture that is the final calculated light pattern from a given light.  It's receiving an exception when rendering from what is essentially `EffectPass.Apply()` complaining that from somewhere within Mono theres an attempted cast from `int32[]` to `Single[]`.  Here's my code that calls it:\n\n<!-- language: c# -->\n\n```\nprivate void ExecuteTechnique(Texture2D source, RenderTarget2D destination,\n                              string techniqueName, Texture2D shadowMap)\n{\n    graphicsDevice.SetRenderTarget(destination);\n    graphicsDevice.Clear(Color.Transparent);\n\n    resolveShadowsEffect.Parameters[\"renderTargetSizeX\"].SetValue((float)baseSizeX);\n    resolveShadowsEffect.Parameters[\"renderTargetSizeY\"].SetValue((float)baseSizeY);\n\n    if (source != null)\n        resolveShadowsEffect.Parameters[\"InputTexture\"].SetValue(source);\n    if (shadowMap != null)\n        resolveShadowsEffect.Parameters[\"ShadowMapTexture\"].SetValue(shadowMap);\n\n    resolveShadowsEffect.CurrentTechnique = resolveShadowsEffect\n        .Techniques[techniqueName];\n\n    try\n    {\n        foreach (EffectPass pass in resolveShadowsEffect.CurrentTechnique.Passes)\n        {\n            pass.Apply(); // <--- InvalidCastException re-enters my program here\n            quadRender.Render(Vector2.One * -1, Vector2.One);\n        }\n    }\n    catch (Exception ex)\n    {\n        Util.Log(LogManager.LogLevel.Critical, ex.Message);\n    }\n    graphicsDevice.SetRenderTarget(null);\n}\n```\n\nAnd here is the stacktrace:\n\n```\nat Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.ConstantBuffer.SetData(Int32 offset, Int32 rows, Int32 columns, Object data)\n   at Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.ConstantBuffer.SetParameter(Int32 offset, EffectParameter param)\n   at Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.ConstantBuffer.Update(EffectParameterCollection parameters)\n   at Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.EffectPass.Apply()\n   at JASG.ShadowmapResolver.ExecuteTechnique(Texture2D source, RenderTarget2D destination, String techniqueName, Texture2D shadowMap) in C:\\Users\\[snip]\\dropbox\\Projects\\JASG2\\JASG\\JASG\\Rendering\\ShadowmapResolver.cs:line 253\n```\n\nSo it would appear that one of the parameters of my shader which I am trying to set is confusing monogame somehow, but I don't see what it could be.  I'm pushing floats, not int arrays.  I even tried changing the `RenderTarget2D.SurfaceFormat` from Color to Single for all my targets and textures, still gives the exact same error.\n\nOutside of the function I gave, in a broader scope, there are no other parameters being set since another `EffectPass.Apply`.  There are multiple other effects that render _without error_ before this one.\n\nIn case it helps, here's the source for the MonoGame Framework regarding `ConstantBuffer.SetData()`\n\n<!-- language: c# -->\n\n```\nprivate void SetData(int offset, int rows, int columns, object data)\n{\n    // Shader registers are always 4 bytes and all the\n    // incoming data objects should be 4 bytes per element.\n    const int elementSize = 4;\n    const int rowSize = elementSize * 4;\n\n    // Take care of a single element.\n    if (rows == 1 && columns == 1)\n    {\n        // EffectParameter stores all values in arrays by default.             \n        if (data is Array)\n            Buffer.BlockCopy(data as Array, 0, _buffer, offset, elementSize);\n        else\n        {\n            // TODO: When we eventually expose the internal Shader \n            // API then we will need to deal with non-array elements.\n            throw new NotImplementedException();   \n        }\n    }\n\n    // Take care of the single copy case!\n    else if (rows == 1 || (rows == 4 && columns == 4))\n        Buffer.BlockCopy(data as Array, 0, _buffer, offset, rows*columns*elementSize);\n    else\n    {\n        var source = data as Array;\n\n        var stride = (columns*elementSize);\n        for (var y = 0; y < rows; y++)\n            Buffer.BlockCopy(source, stride*y, _buffer, offset + (rowSize*y), \n                             columns*elementSize);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIs this some sort of marshaling problem?  Thanks for your time!\n\nEdit: P.S.: The exception is an `InvalidCastException` and not a `NotImplementedException`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2287/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2286","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2286/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2286/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2286/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2286","id":29694731,"number":2286,"title":"Added additional iOS application events to Game class","user":{"login":"picobots","id":2413048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2413048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots","html_url":"https://github.com/picobots","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2014-03-18T23:24:40Z","updated_at":"2014-07-11T00:28:31Z","closed_at":"2014-03-19T15:41:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/2286","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2286","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2286.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2286.patch"},"body":"## Overview\n\nMonoGame already gives us access to these iOS app lifecycle events (through Game.Activated and Game.Deactivated):\n- `applicationDidBecomeActive`\n- `applicationWillResignActive`\n\nBut although MonoGame has callbacks for these additional iOS application events under the hood, there was previously no way to access them through the Game class:\n- `applicationDidEnterBackground`\n- `applicationWillEnterForeground`\n- `applicationDidReceiveMemoryWarning`\n\nThis commit adds `EnterBackground`, `EnterForeground`, and `MemoryWarningReceived` events to the MonoGame Game class (conditionally compiled for IOS only).\n\nI personally think it's good to be able to respond to these other events from XNA game code. For me, simply responding to Activated and Deactivated isn't ideal; my game saves constantly and aggressively, but I only occasionally want to upload my save data to the cloud (using iCloud on iOS). For me, applicationDidEnterBackground is the perfect time to do this, because it signals that the user is potentially quitting the game for a while (vs. simply deactivating the game, which might only last a second or two).\n## Concerns\n\nFirst of all, this is my first ever GitHub fork and commit, so I apologize if I screw this up. I hope I'm doing this right :)\n\nSecondly, I noticed that some of the other custom Game event declarations use a `[CLSCompliant(false)]` attribute, for example:\n\n``` C#\n#if WINDOWS_STOREAPP\n    [CLSCompliant(false)]\n    public event EventHandler<ViewStateChangedEventArgs> ApplicationViewChanged;\n#endif\n\n#if WINRT\n    [CLSCompliant(false)]\n    public ApplicationExecutionState PreviousExecutionState { get; internal set; }\n#endif\n```\n\nI'm not sure exactly what that attribute means. Should the event declarations I added for EnterBackground, EnterForeground, and MemoryWarningReceived also be decorated with the same attribute?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2286/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2285","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2285/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2285/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2285/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2285","id":29691630,"number":2285,"title":"SoundEffectInstances do not recover from iOS interruptions","user":{"login":"picobots","id":2413048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2413048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots","html_url":"https://github.com/picobots","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-03-18T22:36:02Z","updated_at":"2014-12-21T22:15:16Z","closed_at":"2014-12-21T22:15:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If a player receives a phone call while playing a MonoGame game, when they return from the call (after hanging up or ignoring the call), MonoGame's OpenAL context seems to be broken. After the interruption ends, **sound effect instances no longer play anymore**. The only way to restore sound is to completely terminate the iOS app and restart it.\n\nTo solve this, it looks like we need to catch the interruption and set the OpenAL context to NULL, and then, when the interruption ends, reset the OpenAL context to its original value. From [Apple's docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Audio/Conceptual/AudioSessionProgrammingGuide/HandlingAudioInterruptions/HandlingAudioInterruptions.html):\n\n> When using OpenAL for audio playback, implement an interruption listener callback function, as you do when using Audio Queue Services. However, your interruption code must additionally manage the OpenAL context. Upon interruption, set the OpenAL context to NULL. After the interruption ends, set the context to its prior state.\n\nI've included some sample code below to help reproduce the issue. It creates a new `SoundEffectInstance` and plays it repeatedly every 2 seconds. If you open this app on an iPhone and then call that phone ([Gmail Chat's phone call tool](http://www.google.com/chat/voice/) is a great way to test this), the OpenAL session will be interrupted and when you return to the app the sound effect no longer plays.\n\nI should also note that iOS interruptions are not limited to phone calls either; FaceTime calls also produce interruptions, and even text messages, alarms, and other modal alerts can cause interruptions on earlier versions of iOS. So this seems like a pretty critical bug to fix.\n\nI have a fair amount of experience with the iOS sound notification/interruption API, but I'm very new to the MonoGame codebase, so I don't feel completely comfortable trying to hack the solution in place. Is there a resident \"MonoGame sound expert\"? I would love to collaborate with someone here to cobble together a solution and squash this bug.\n\nHere's the sample code for reproducing this issue. (Note: You'll have to replace the `Content/sound.wav` file referenced below with whatever sound effect file you're using.)\n\n``` C#\npublic class Game1 : Game\n{\n    GraphicsDeviceManager graphics;\n    SoundEffectInstance soundEffectInstance;\n\n    TimeSpan soundMax = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2);\n    TimeSpan soundElapsed = TimeSpan.Zero;\n\n    public Game1 ()\n    {\n        graphics = new GraphicsDeviceManager (this);\n\n        Content.RootDirectory = \"Content\";\n\n        graphics.IsFullScreen = true;\n        graphics.SupportedOrientations = DisplayOrientation.Portrait;\n    }\n\n    protected override void Initialize ()\n    {\n        base.Initialize ();\n    }\n\n    protected override void LoadContent ()\n    {\n        soundEffectInstance = new SoundEffect(\n            File.ReadAllBytes(\"Content/sound.wav\"), 41000, AudioChannels.Mono\n        ).CreateInstance();\n    }\n\n    protected override void Update (GameTime gameTime)\n    {\n        soundElapsed += gameTime.ElapsedGameTime;\n        if (soundElapsed >= soundMax)\n        {\n            soundElapsed = TimeSpan.Zero;\n            soundEffectInstance.Play ();\n        }\n\n        base.Update (gameTime);\n    }\n\n    protected override void Draw (GameTime gameTime)\n    {\n        graphics.GraphicsDevice.Clear (Color.CornflowerBlue);\n        base.Draw (gameTime);\n    }\n}\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2284","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2284/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2284/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2284/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2284","id":29620569,"number":2284,"title":"When the cursor is not visible, Mouse.SetPosition requires special treatment on Linux","user":{"login":"csantosbh","id":1847919,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1847919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantosbh","html_url":"https://github.com/csantosbh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantosbh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantosbh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantosbh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantosbh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantosbh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantosbh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantosbh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantosbh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantosbh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2014-03-18T05:10:58Z","updated_at":"2014-06-21T00:45:57Z","closed_at":"2014-04-24T09:15:44Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/2284","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2284","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2284.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2284.patch"},"body":"This partially fixes https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/issues/2283.

If the borders are not visible, the cursor is not internally moved to the requested position.\n\n**Local information**\nThis was tested on Ubuntu 12.04 x86 with gnome 3.4.2.1, on a MSI gx660r (a notebook with an ATI HD5870 video card).\n\n**To reproduce**\nRun the following code. Click to set the mouse on the requested position.\n\n``` c#\nusing System;\nusing Microsoft.Xna.Framework;\nusing Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics;\nusing Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input;\n\nnamespace MouseTest {\n    public class Game1 : Game {\n        GraphicsDeviceManager graphics;\n        SpriteBatch spriteBatch;\n        private Texture2D _cursor;\n        private Vector2 cursorPos;\n\n        public Game1 () {\n            graphics = new GraphicsDeviceManager (this);\n            Content.RootDirectory = \"Content\";\n            graphics.IsFullScreen = false;      \n            graphics.PreferredBackBufferWidth = 640;\n            graphics.PreferredBackBufferHeight = 480;\n            //Window.IsBorderless = true;\n            IsMouseVisible = false;\n        }\n\n        protected override void LoadContent () {\n            spriteBatch = new SpriteBatch (GraphicsDevice);\n            _cursor = Content.Load<Texture2D>(\"cursor3\");\n        }\n\n        protected override void Update (GameTime gameTime) {\n            KeyboardState _kbs = Keyboard.GetState ();\n            if (_kbs.IsKeyDown (Keys.Escape)) {\n                Exit ();\n            }\n\n            MouseState _mouseState = Mouse.GetState ();\n            if (_mouseState.LeftButton == ButtonState.Pressed) {\n                Mouse.SetPosition (graphics.PreferredBackBufferWidth / 2, graphics.PreferredBackBufferHeight / 2 - 1);\n            }\n            _mouseState = Mouse.GetState ();\n            cursorPos = new Vector2 (_mouseState.X, _mouseState.Y);\n\n            base.Update (gameTime);\n        }\n\n        protected override void Draw (GameTime gameTime) {\n            graphics.GraphicsDevice.Clear (Color.CornflowerBlue);\n\n            // Draws cursor\n            spriteBatch.Begin();\n            spriteBatch.Draw(_cursor, cursorPos, Color.White);\n            spriteBatch.End();\n\n            base.Draw (gameTime);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Solution**\nThis is a two step solution issue. When the cursor is hidden, it seems that OpenTK's OpenTK.Input.Mouse.SetPosition expects the coordinates to be specified as an offset with respect to the previous mouse position (which must be translated to the center of the screen). This can be fixed in Input/Mouse.cs.\n\nThe second issue is that the cursor centering on OpenTK is made with respect to the whole window (including its borders), which means it cannot be computed as (width/2, height/2), and depends on the windowing system. This needs to be fixed in OpenTK, on Platform/X11/X11GLNative.cs.\n\nI'll be submitting patches for these issues shortly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2282","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2282/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2282/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2282/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2282","id":29537575,"number":2282,"title":"Mixed Licenses (MIT, Dual MSPL/LGPL, GPL!)","user":{"login":"flibitijibibo","id":1396814,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1396814?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo","html_url":"https://github.com/flibitijibibo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":14,"created_at":"2014-03-17T05:01:06Z","updated_at":"2016-03-31T00:27:51Z","closed_at":"2016-03-31T00:27:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So we've been doing a full sweep of the MG-SDL2 code, as part of the process of making FNA:\n\nhttps://github.com/flibitijibibo/MonoGame\n\nWe're noticing a LOT of various files with varying licenses. Here are the ones we've found so far:\n- LzxDecoder.cs is released under a dual MSPL/LGPL license. This one's fine, but I only noticed it once we were editing all the files in `Content/`. Might need to be noted somewhere.\n- Various files throughout the project, particularly the ContentReaders, have the Mono.Xna license, the MIT license. Was this all re-licensed under the MSPL when the MonoGame project became a thing, or are these license headers accurate? In the latter case, this may need to be noted in the main LICENSE file.\n- Vector4, SpriteFont and ReflectiveReader have code from SilverSprite, another MIT-licensed project. Same question as the Mono.Xna project, basically.\n\nAnd while this doesn't quite affect the FNA project in the same way, now that I've rewritten the Audio engine there, I figured the MonoGame team ought to know: The XACT WaveBank implementation in MonoGame right now is a C# copy of Luigi Auriemma's unxwb project... which is released under the GPL. Far as I know, there's been no re-licensing of that code, so this could be a serious legal problem for a LOT of projects out there. I'm actually still auditing everything in MG-SDL2's XACT reimplementation to be sure that everything I got was from either MonoGame as brand new information (for instance, the byte-to-float volume calculation) or from a different source altogether (i.e. various wikis with bits and pieces of XACT binary info, published under a permissive license). But yeah, that was a fun discovery.\n\nAnyway, this is what we've found so far; I'll update if we find any more oddities regarding licenses.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2281","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2281/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2281/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2281/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2281","id":29482015,"number":2281,"title":"Proposal / Request for Feedback: Transition to a rolling release model","user":{"login":"hach-que","id":504826,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/504826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que","html_url":"https://github.com/hach-que","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2014-03-15T01:02:57Z","updated_at":"2015-01-18T03:36:19Z","closed_at":"2015-01-18T03:36:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So I was looking at the new MonoGame site and I've realised that the latest official release was 3.0.1, which is now quickly approaching over a year ago.  Looking at the differences between master and develop on GitHub reveals:\n\n\"This branch is 26 commits ahead and 1993 commits behind develop\"\n\nOriginally I used to use the official releases, but transitioned to using development builds and eventually went to using MonoGame as a Git submodule.  While I've found that the latter option offers far more flexibility in terms of updating to get bug fixes, I still understand that some people like just referencing DLLs or binaries.\n\nThat said, I don't think the official versioned releases are offering a lot of value right now.  Although they're promoted on the downloads page, they've 1993 commits behind the latest development head.  That is **a lot** of work, both functionality and bug fixes, which aren't right now being promoted to people who are new to MonoGame.  A prime example of this is the work being done on the content pipeline, which is now reasonably usable (I use the APIs in my higher-level engine without issue) but is not available to users of 3.0.1.  I believe the last release date (3rd March 2013) also creates a perception of \"no longer developed\", even though this is far from the case.  \n\nSo the general proposal is something like this:\n- Promote \"develop\" as the new stable, official version for people to be using.  That is, the installers and DLLs that are generated from the develop branch are the ones promoted on the website.\n- The current official versioning is moved to an \"older releases\" section on the download page, with a note that MonoGame uses rolling releases (and hence there is no explicit versioning).\n- This has the added advantage that any bug reports that are coming through are going to be relevant and up-to-date, and bug fixes can likely be fixed by people grabbing the latest DLLs (or updating the Git submodule).\n\nWhat do people think of this proposal?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2280","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2280/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2280/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2280/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2280","id":29447572,"number":2280,"title":"Color.Invert -
