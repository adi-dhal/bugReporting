Automatically builds MonoGame Content projects before the project is built\n2. Builds incrementally to allow faster development\n3. Supports multiple projects in the same directory (like resolution packs), whitespaces in paths (like the Visual Studio 2013 folder)\n4. Outputs built content to `ProjectDirectory\\Content\\PlatformName` (avoiding clash of contents built for different platforms)\n5. Content files will be added to the project and copied to the output directory\n6. Content files will be automatically packaged with the rest of the app (including Android)\n\nTL;DL\nWorks as seamlessly as XNA content pipeline\n### How to get it to work\n\nAdd the following lines to the csproj file using a text editor:\n#### At the end of the first `<PropertyGroup>`:\n\n``` XML\n<MonoGamePlatform>PlatformName</MonoGamePlatform>\n```\n\n(PlatformName shuold be iOS, Android, WindowsPhone, etc)\n#### Somewhere after an `</ItemGroup>`:\n\n``` XML\n  <ItemGroup>\n    <MonoGameContentReference Include=\"PathToYour.mgcb\">\n    </MonoGameContentReference>\n  </ItemGroup>\n```\n#### At the end of the file, before `</Project>`\n\n``` XML\n  <Import Project=\"PathTo\\MonoGame.Content.Builder.targets\" />\n```\n\nThanks to @jamesford42 and @tomspilman for the help.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3138/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3137","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3137/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3137/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3137/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3137","id":47118170,"number":3137,"title":"Gamepad support for Android","user":{"login":"demonixis","id":1017126,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1017126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/demonixis","html_url":"https://github.com/demonixis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demonixis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demonixis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demonixis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demonixis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demonixis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demonixis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demonixis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demonixis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demonixis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2014-10-29T07:20:52Z","updated_at":"2014-11-02T07:45:24Z","closed_at":"2014-11-02T07:45:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/3137","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3137","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3137.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3137.patch"},"body":"This pull request adds gamepad support for Android devices.

The aim of this feature is to reduce clone times and download usages.  This issue covers both packaging third party dependencies internally for MonoGame, and packaging MonoGame itself.\n\n**Dependencies Repository within MonoGame**\n\nCurrently the MonoGame.Dependencies repository is 117.31Mb to clone, and this happens every time you clone a new copy of MonoGame.  If you're using Git submodules in your project, that means you're taking this download hit every time you clone on a build server or otherwise cloning a copy of your game (you can work around this with some Git magic + cloning for build servers, but it's particularly susceptible to race conditions and doesn't solve it in the general case).\n\nThe MonoGame repository itself is 45.67Mb; if you include all of the submodules that are cloned when doing `git submodule update --init --recursive`, then the total initial clone size is 198.89Mb (Kickstart is 35.91Mb).\n\nUsing some naive reference calculations (looking at the definition files to determine what references the runtime + content pipeline uses on each platform), the equivalent binary package for each platform for the MonoGame.Dependencies repository would be:\n- Linux:\n  - Runtime: 1.3Mb (lzma)\n  - Content Pipeline: 21.9Mb (lzma)\n- Windows:\n  - Runtime: 2.1Mb (lzma)\n  - Content Pipeline: 29.6Mb (lzma)\n- iOS:\n  - Runtime: Apparently there are none according to definition files?  This doesn't sound right\n- Android:\n  - Runtime: 330Kb (lzma)\n\nI haven't measured the other platforms, but I expected a similar pattern to emerge.  Most of the framework runtime dependencies are reasonably small, while most of the file size bloat for the Content Pipeline comes from the inclusion of ffmpeg / ffprobe (only one of which appears to be used for the video content compilation).\n\nWe can apply the same logic here with the Kickstart repository.  This would save us downloading Kickstart at all if the developer isn't generating projects for Linux / Mac OS (although the MonoGame build server would download a binary package for this since it builds for all platforms).\n\n**EDIT:** I'm now in the process of updating Protobuild to use LZMA compression for packages instead of GZip.\n\n**MonoGame itself**\n\nPackaging MonoGame itself would offer a new way of obtaining MonoGame binaries for various platforms.  Primarily this would assist with people who use MonoGame as a library, either as a Git submodule or by depending on users running the installer.  The users of the former setup would save significant download and build time and the latter could simplify usage of their library / game as people wanting to build code no longer need to install MonoGame explicitly.\n\n_Future benefits (i.e. functionality that is planned for Protobuild, but not yet implemented):_\n\nProtobuild is designed to support swapping out binary for source code and vice-versa.  This means when using the Protobuild package with a binary version, users only need to run `Protobuild.exe --swap MonoGame` in order to swap out the binaries for a Git submodule.  This would make it significantly easier to debug issues within MonoGame if users run into it; certainly easier than any mechanism NuGet provides, or usage of binaries through the installer.\n\nThis is also a pretext to supporting project templates in Protobuild itself.  These would allow users to create new projects through the Protobuild executable, via template packages in the Protobuild index.  Either by doing `Protobuild.exe --create MonoGame/Platformer2D` or by using the GUI that opens when there is no module in the current directory.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3125","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3125/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3125/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3125/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3125","id":46985744,"number":3125,"title":"Desired: Exception when VertexDeclaration stride does not match template parameter size in DrawUser(Indexed)Primitives","user":{"login":"DissidentDan","id":7416047,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7416047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DissidentDan","html_url":"https://github.com/DissidentDan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DissidentDan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DissidentDan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DissidentDan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DissidentDan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DissidentDan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DissidentDan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DissidentDan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DissidentDan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DissidentDan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-10-28T03:25:46Z","updated_at":"2015-02-16T15:54:55Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In XNA, when you use a VertexDeclaration whose stride is smaller than the size of the vertex data type supplied to DrawUserIndexedPrimitives (the IVertexType template parameter), an exception is thrown.

For example, pixel data retrieved using `RenderTarget2D.GetData` can be slightly different than expected due to the nature of dithering.\n\nThis issue seem to mainly affect Mali T400 devices (most Galaxy S2, Galaxy Tab3, Galaxy Note).\n\nDisabling dithering by default might result in more banding if the backbuffer/rendertaget is 16bit but at least it will be deterministic (performances might be better as well). AFAIK, XNA 4.0 doesn't expose a way to enable/disable dithering (DirectX 10 deprecated support for automatic dithering) so I am not sure if it was up to the Windows Phone device vendor to enable it or not.\n\nWe could disable dithering in the `GraphicsDevice` initialization to avoid redundant state changes but I added it to the RasterizerState to make sure it is disabled even if third party code re-enables it. The RasterizerState code do need some caching anyway, we should do this as a separate PR.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3111","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3111/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3111/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3111/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3111","id":46686603,"number":3111,"title":"Hooks into ViewController","user":{"login":"nikhilsinha","id":3156721,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3156721?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhilsinha","html_url":"https://github.com/nikhilsinha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhilsinha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhilsinha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhilsinha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhilsinha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhilsinha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhilsinha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhilsinha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhilsinha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhilsinha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2014-10-23T22:48:47Z","updated_at":"2017-04-24T18:29:31Z","closed_at":"2017-04-24T18:29:30Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/3111","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3111","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3111.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3111.patch"},"body":"I needed to add hooks into ViewDidAppear and ViewDidDisappear in the iOSGameViewController in order to use Flurry's ads.
