I followed this tutorial:\n\nhttps://github.com/mono/MonoGame/wiki/Tutorials:Getting-Started-Guide-Linux#getting-and-building-the-latest-sources-develop3d\n\nAnd also did a submodule update to get libraries and what else was downloaded from there so that I could also use functions like SoundEffect.FromStream() which weren't there in the normal version of the sources.\n\nNow I got held of a problem with getting the correct screen size to work wich is awesome, but I am newly having a problem with my mouse cursor where its (In a window with the resolution 1280x720) Eiter (0 - 1280 ; 0) or (0 ; 0 - 720).\n\nAnd I just downloaded and set everything up to have the current sources. But I cant believe that such a weird thing could be in there... can it?\n\nOr did I made a mistake? I'm just getting the cursors position from stuff as easy as:\n\n```\n        MouseState mouseState = Mouse.GetState();\n        _position = new Vector2(mouseState.X, mouseState.Y);\n```\n\nPlease help :)\n\nOh and before I forget, Im using the Linux Mint 15 OS with monoDevelop to do everything on linux.\n\nGreetings,\n\nRavior\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1901/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1900","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1900/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1900/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1900/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1900","id":17527834,"number":1900,"title":"Content Pipeline fixes for MacOS and Linux","user":{"login":"dellis1972","id":810617,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/810617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972","html_url":"https://github.com/dellis1972","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2013-08-01T19:59:48Z","updated_at":"2014-07-10T21:21:30Z","closed_at":"2013-08-02T15:18:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/1900","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1900","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1900.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1900.patch"},"body":"There are a whole bunch of changes there. \nIncluding the new font generation stuff. \n\nBecause SharpFont requires a full path to the font, I put in a requirement that the font files (.ttf etc) need to be in the same directory as the .spritefont file.

Audio data is needlessly held on to after it has been given to OpenAL.**_\n\nYou will notice that we remove byte[] arrays in OALSoundBuffer and SoundEffectInstance in this patch. The code in those files implies that we need the data for purposes other than loading directly into OpenAL, but no code in MonoGame currently uses this. So, we essentially keep a duplicate copy of_ every single OpenAL buffer_ for the duration of the program's runtime unless we explicitly destroy the data ourselves.\n\nBy simply removing these from the files, we improve memory use drastically, and for XACT, we improve it _by at least 50%_.\n\n**_2. Redundant decoding/rewriting of wavedata is performed presumably to reuse the public API.**_\n\nWhile it makes sense on paper, the fact is we're decoding header data only to reencode it when we're \"done\" in a single method multiple times for every single audio file that gets loaded into MonoGame. This can possibly introduce memory problems like those found in bullet one, and it's also a pretty goofy waste of resources when we can just send the data to internal methods that will eventually give it to OpenAL.\n\nBy fixing these two issues, performance for XACT/SoundEffects on OpenAL has improved immensely (mostly in regard to memory use, CPU use certainly improves but is not noticeable on high-end machines).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1893/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1892","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1892/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1892/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1892/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1892","id":17296383,"number":1892,"title":"iOS Landscape orientation","user":{"login":"ivanmazur62","id":1672380,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1672380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanmazur62","html_url":"https://github.com/ivanmazur62","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanmazur62/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanmazur62/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanmazur62/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanmazur62/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanmazur62/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanmazur62/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanmazur62/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanmazur62/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanmazur62/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-07-27T10:08:46Z","updated_at":"2013-07-27T18:56:00Z","closed_at":"2013-07-27T18:56:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Used Xamarin 4.0.10 and last version MonoGame for iOS on Mac OS X.\nI have a problem with Landscape orientation. \n\nMonoTouch.Foundation.MonoTouchException: Objective-C exception thrown. \nName: UIApplicationInvalidInterfaceOrientation Reason: Supported orientations \nhas no common orientation with the application, and shouldAutorotate is returning YES\n\nIf I add Portait orientation  everything is fine.

The problem I'm having is that when I use it to rebuild a sprite font, the program RAM usage jumps from 136MB to 2100MB.  According to the output of the program:\n\n```\nFont reloaded with RAM 115MB.\nFont reloaded with RAM 116MB.\nFont reloaded with RAM 118MB.\n...\nStart font rebuild at 128MB.\nFont data was 0MB.\nFont data is 0MB.\nFont reloaded with RAM 2184MB.\nEnd font rebuild at 2184MB.\n```\n\nIt doesn't appear that the SpriteFont itself is actually large, as the resulting binary data is under a MB in size.  But whatever the content pipeline does results in 2GB of RAM being used!\n\nThe font asset class has `ReloadFont` and `RebuildFont` functions:\n\n``` csharp\npublic void ReloadFont()\n{\n    if (this.m_AssetContentManager != null && this.FontData != null)\n    {\n        using (var stream = new MemoryStream(this.FontData))\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Font reloaded with RAM \" + (Process.GetCurrentProcess().WorkingSet64 / 1024 / 1024) + \"MB.\");\n            this.m_AssetContentManager.SetStream(this.Name, stream);\n            this.m_AssetContentManager.Purge(this.Name);\n            this.Font = this.m_AssetContentManager.Load<SpriteFont>(this.Name);\n            this.m_AssetContentManager.UnsetStream(this.Name);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\npublic void RebuildFont()\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Start font rebuild at \" + (Process.GetCurrentProcess().WorkingSet64 / 1024 / 1024) + \"MB.\");\n    if (this.FontData != null)\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Font data was \" + (this.FontData.Length / 1024 / 1024) + \"MB.\");\n    var data = this.m_ContentCompiler.BuildSpriteFont(\n        this.FontName,\n        this.FontSize,\n        0,\n        false);\n    if (data != null)\n    {\n        this.FontData = data;\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Font data is \" + (this.FontData.Length / 1024 / 1024) + \"MB.\");\n        this.ReloadFont();\n    }\n    Console.WriteLine(\"End font rebuild at \" + (Process.GetCurrentProcess().WorkingSet64 / 1024 / 1024) + \"MB.\");\n}\n```\n\nThe implementation of `BuildSpriteFont` is:\n\n``` csharp\npublic byte[] BuildSpriteFont(string fontName, float size, float spacing, bool useKerning)\n{\n    var chars = new List<char>();\n    for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++)\n        chars.Add((char)i);\n    var description = new FontDescription(\n        fontName,\n        size,\n        spacing,\n        FontDescriptionStyle.Regular,\n        useKerning,\n        chars);\n    var manager = new PipelineManager(null, null, null);\n    var dictionary = new OpaqueDataDictionary();\n    var processor = manager.CreateProcessor(\"FontDescriptionProcessor\", dictionary);\n    var context = new DummyContentProcessorContext(TargetPlatform.Linux);\n    var content = processor.Process(description, context);\n    var compiler = new Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content.Pipeline.Serialization.Compiler.ContentCompiler();\n    var temp = Path.GetTempFileName();\n    try\n    {\n        using (var stream = new FileStream(temp, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Write))\n        {\n            compiler.Compile(stream, content, TargetPlatform.Windows, GraphicsProfile.Reach, false, Environment.CurrentDirectory, Environment.CurrentDirectory);\n        }\n        using (var stream = new FileStream(temp, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read))\n        {\n            stream.Position = 0;\n            using (var reader = new BinaryReader(stream))\n            {\n                var result = reader.ReadBytes(Int32.MaxValue);\n                File.Delete(temp);\n                return result;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    finally\n    {\n        File.Delete(temp);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI don't know a lot about the content pipeline, but surely it shouldn't be using this much RAM to compile content?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1883/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1882","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1882/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1882/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1882/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1882","id":17076027,"number":1882,"title":"Improved
