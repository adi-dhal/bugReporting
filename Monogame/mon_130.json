Only WindowsGL/MonoGame.Framework.dll and OpenTK.dll are referenced! (that's really weird).\n\nThis problem does not appear on monoGame 3.0.1 and the program runs correctly (after changing the parameters of a constructor which has changed to 3.2)\n\nAny ideas?\nThanks

just thought I would quickly submit this bug I found here: http://monogame.codeplex.com/discussions/463287\n\nI will just quote here since Kak already describes it quite perfectly:\n\n\"The problem is that sometimes (really often actually) , in Windows RT (Surface RT in my test hardware) when you keep a finger \"quiet\" in the touch panel, the control lags and even when you release the finger, the touchPanel keeps being pushed (in example, in my platform game the main char keeps moving for a few seconds after I release the touch panel) \n\nI think that the reason is that sometimes you receive \"touches\" in WinRT where the pointer hasn't moved at all (same position as before) and this causes the delta movement to be 0. \n\nThen in TouchLocation.UpdateState, the (delta.LengthSquared() > 0.001f) causes to return false, which makes TouchPanel.GetState() not being able to process all the buffered events as it returns at the first TouchPanel.RefreshState call.\n\nOnce the deltas are 0, only 1 event is consumed each frame in the GetState function, producing the lag. \n\nIt seems also that Surface RT \"emits\" this kind of messages very often, so if your game is very intensive, the lag increases. \"\n\nI can reproduce the very same issue on my Dell XPS 10 (which is running WindowsRT as well).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2112","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2112/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2112/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2112/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2112","id":21759154,"number":2112,"title":"Renamed

Having an expected exception makes debugging difficult when you want to \"break on thrown\".\n- It's a transitional step for people who still rely on raw assets. When the content pipeline is done, we can remove the raw asset loading code completely, but in the mean time we can give developers the option of explicitly asking the ContentManager to load their raw assets.\n\nFor now, I've not altered the existing functionality.

You can now swipe up and down in the area above your onscreen keyboard to move your app/game around.\n\nWhat goes wrong?\n\nIf you just insert some input and focus another element it goes fine and nothing strange happens but when you move the game/app up and down while the onscreen keyboard is active and you then exit it by focusing another element it will keep firing a touch event while there isn't anything happening the TouchPanel.GetState() keeps giving old and random touch input.\n\nHow to reproduce\n\nI recreated the bug in this project and thereby kinda proved it isn't anything project specific I maybe did wrong. https://www.dropbox.com/s/7rziu3m8l0mk0q9/XAML%20Textinput.rar\n1. Touch on the screen so the Textbox and Button will appear\n2. Touch the textbox so the onscreen keyboard appears\n3. Type a letter and move the screen above the onscreen keyboard up and down\n4. Press enter on the keyboard or tap the button on the left side of the screen\n5. Set a breakpoint inside the Update() inside the if(touches.Count != 0) and watch the breakpoint being hit.\n\nHope my explanation is clear enough. This isn't the worst thing but it can be really frustrating when a player gets a sweet highscore then types in his/her name and accidentally swipes the screen and thereby cause the game to jam itself because the touch events are spammed and thereby uncontrollable which may result in low ratings
