This was mostly used for testing without  needing to plug a 360 controller in during XBLIG development a while back.  We haven't used it much since then as Taptitude has been a Windows Phone game without a need for keyboard support.\n\nNow, we want to use the same keyboard mapper to simulate a gamepad for Windows 8 development as our UI system already supports navigation via GamePad (from our Xbox 360 days) and this would give us Keyboard navigation in Windows for free.\n\nSo while hooking the keyboard input mapper back up I noticed that the keyboard mapper no longer generated input events because we used IsButtonDown to see if a button had become pressed/released and under MonoGame it isn't detecting DPad button state.\n\nI can certainly work around the issue on our end by explicitly checking the DPad state in certain cases but this is an incompatibility worth noting.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1055/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1054","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1054/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1054/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1054/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1054","id":9159364,"number":1054,"title":"MonoGame performance","user":{"login":"sthoahmi","id":2818483,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2818483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi","html_url":"https://github.com/sthoahmi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sthoahmi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2012-12-10T21:22:22Z","updated_at":"2012-12-11T01:21:21Z","closed_at":"2012-12-11T01:21:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I ported a quite large game from XNA to MonoGame on the Windows 7 platform complete with man HLSL shaders.
