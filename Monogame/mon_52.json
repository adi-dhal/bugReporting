PR fixes stuff mentioned in #4457 for Gtk Pipeline Tool.\n\nStuff done:\n- Added \"Open With\", Linux only\n- Added Undo/Redo toolbar buttons\n- Added Cancel toolbar button which appears while the build is running, and build/rebuild buttons hide\n- Updated reference dialog to mimic WinForms one\n- Updated how reference property is displayed in propertygrid\n- Made headerbar separator invisible in case build/rebuild/cancel build aren't visible\n- Allowed user scrolling of build output possible\n- Smoother scrolling\n- Fixed opening of files that contain spaces\n\nUpdate no. 1:\n- Toolbar items / Headerbar items are now connected to actions, this means that changing something on action will change them as well\n- Headerbar now has a proper menu\n\nUpdate no. 2:\n- Fixed pressing open and then canceling creating an empty base item\n- Separate \"Exclude from Project\" and \"Delete\" options\n- Made build output cursor invisible (not mouse cursor, text cursor, text can still be selected)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4458","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4458/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4458/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4458/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4458","id":128365111,"number":4458,"title":"Add

have a skinned fbx model which renders perfectly using BasicEffect. But as soon as I select the SkinnedEffect in the pipeline tool (and in my code), it turns completely black. (using default lighting, specular power 16 and white color).\n\nOn my previous laptop it worked perfectly, but now for some reason it doesn't want to render properly anymore. I've tried to run it on another pc, but sadly I'm getting the same result. This laptop supports DX12 so that shouldn't be a problem.\n\nWhen I use alphablend BlendState the model doesn't render at all. And when I use opaque, it renders black.\n\nI'm using the latest code from the development branch.\n\nCould this be a bug? Or is there something I should supply to the SkinnedEffect to make it work.\nI can supply more info if needed, but I hope someone knows an easy fix for this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4443/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4442","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4442/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4442/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4442/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4442","id":127473488,"number":4442,"title":"Prevent OpenAL calls with 0 buffers or empty buffers","user":{"login":"mrhelmut","id":3427451,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3427451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut","html_url":"https://github.com/mrhelmut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":25,"created_at":"2016-01-19T15:40:46Z","updated_at":"2016-01-25T10:53:30Z","closed_at":"2016-01-25T10:17:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/4442","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4442","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4442.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4442.patch"},"body":"This fixes an error related to differences across OpenAL implementations.\n\n> `AL.BufferData()` generates an \"invalid value\" error if the `size` parameter is `0` on OS X, while it does nothing on Windows. Same applies to `AL.SourceQueueBuffers()`.\n\nI've simply added checks so that it doesn't crash `Song` anymore.\n\nFixes #4440\n\nThis however raises another issue: this shouldn't be happening. The original cause is `VorbisReader.ReadSamples()` occasionally failing to read the ogg stream by returning `0` and skipping a few samples or simply reset the stream (it loses track of the stream position). Which means that there is a bug in NVorbis, or something that Mono don't like in NVorbis.\n\nThis means that, even though it doesn't crash anymore, it may occasionally skip a few seconds of a `Song`, replay a previous buffer, or reset it at worse. It also seems to break the stream initial position, make `Song` to start at random position after the first occurrence of this issue.\n\n@dellis1972 Do you find acceptable to merge this until I can figure out what's wrong with NVorbis?\n\nEven though the original `OggStreamer` may be a couple years old now, maybe @renaudbedard could have some thoughts about this (did you experienced similar NVorbis issues on Mono?).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4442/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4441","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4441/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4441/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4441/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4441","id":127470931,"number":4441,"title":"How can I create MonoGameSetup.exe from Monogame.develop distribution?","user":{"login":"adggithub","id":5577619,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5577619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adggithub","html_url":"https://github.com/adggithub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adggithub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adggithub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adggithub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adggithub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adggithub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adggithub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adggithub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adggithub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adggithub/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-01-19T15:28:52Z","updated_at":"2016-01-25T04:45:24Z","closed_at":"2016-01-25T04:45:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I want to increase the number of bones in the skinnedmodels.cs, and in general I'd like to become able to collaborate in the monogame development.

Hence, it most probably mean that a buffer is still in use, though it shouldn't if `AL.SourceUnqueueBuffers()` returned it...\n\nUPDATE: got it! I'm testing it before opening a PR.\n\nFYI, it is a discrepancy of OpenAL across platforms. `AL.BufferData()` generates this error if the `size` parameter is `0` on OS X, while it does nothing on Windows.

The actual output is that the texture is written to the framebuffer when it should not ever pass the stencil test.\n\n``` csharp\n    public class Game1 : Game\n    {\n        GraphicsDeviceManager graphics;\n        SpriteBatch _spriteBatch;\n        Texture2D _maskTex;\n\n        // only write when the stencil buffer has 1\n        public static DepthStencilState EqualStencilState = new DepthStencilState() {\n            StencilEnable = true,\n            StencilFunction = CompareFunction.Equal,\n            StencilPass = StencilOperation.Keep,\n            ReferenceStencil = 1,\n            DepthBufferEnable = false,\n        };\n\n\n        public Game1()\n        {\n            graphics = new GraphicsDeviceManager( this );\n            graphics.PreferredDepthStencilFormat = DepthFormat.Depth24Stencil8;\n            Content.RootDirectory = \"Content\";              \n        }\n\n\n        protected override void LoadContent()\n        {\n            // Create a new SpriteBatch, which can be used to draw textures.\n            _spriteBatch = new SpriteBatch( GraphicsDevice );\n            _maskTex = Content.Load<Texture2D>( \"mask\" );\n        }\n\n\n        protected override void Draw( GameTime gameTime )\n        {\n            GraphicsDevice.Clear( Color.Transparent );\n\n            _spriteBatch.Begin( SpriteSortMode.Immediate, null, SamplerState.PointClamp, EqualStencilState, null, null );\n            _spriteBatch.Draw( _maskTex, new Vector2( 200, 200 ), Color.White );\n            _spriteBatch.End();\n\n            base.Draw( gameTime );\n        }\n    }\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4434/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4433","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4433/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4433/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4433/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4433","id":127118668,"number":4433,"title":"Refactor GraphicsDevice.PresentationParameters","user":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":185445795,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/Help%20Wanted","name":"Help Wanted","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2016-01-17T19:46:32Z","updated_at":"2017-01-16T12:17:17Z","closed_at":"2017-01-16T12:17:17Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Doing some experimenting against XNA for #4425 I found that our implementation of `GraphicsDevice.PresentationParameters` is wrong.\n\n`GraphicsDevice.PresentationParameters` is only the output presentation values representing the state of the `GraphicsDevice` the last time the presentation was changed.\n\nThis means `GraphicsDeviceManager` shouldn't be making changes to it directly.

Game was not working on Arch Linux with MonoGame mono kickstart.\n   I got with the player and solved the issue. Since Arch Linux have newer libraries this was the issue:\n   libgif.so.4 => not found\n   libpng12.so.0 => not found\n   And on Arch Linux he had \n   libgif.so.7 and libpng16\n   He added the older libs and the game started working!\n2. After making it work on Arch Linux, full screen was not working, only very small part of the full screen was showing and the rest was transparent, you could see the desktop. When going in windowed mode it was fine until he reached 1920x1080 window mode resolution.\n   Also when playing in windowed mode it is not a real window but a black full screen with the game of the windowed mode resolution size.\n3. I have complaint from 2nd player that the game would not start at all on Windows with ATI GPU, still have to investigate this. A while ago one friend could not start the game at all on different ATI GPU PC.\n4. Game is not working properly in full screen on 4K monitors and on Mac retina displays. The background is black and the game shows in top left 1/4 of the screen. Switching to windowed mode it works fine. I have added window mode resolutions up to 4K and it works with no issues.\n\nHope you find this helpful and find a quick solution @cra0zy @mrhelmut @tomspilman \nI will update you as I find more issues or solutions.\n\nThanks,\nEndi\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4431/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4430","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4430/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4430/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4430/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4430","id":127064787,"number":4430,"title":"Documentation for packaging and distributing projects","user":{"login":"mrhelmut","id":3427451,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3427451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut","html_url":"https://github.com/mrhelmut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":12,"created_at":"2016-01-17T00:18:22Z","updated_at":"2017-08-16T22:59:06Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/4430","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4430","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4430.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4430.patch"},"body":"I started working on some documentation regarding how to package desktop projects for market distribution.\n\nThis is a very early work, mostly a draft, therefore not ready to be merged.\n\nTopics planned:\n- referencing all runtime requirements for both Windows & DesktopGL projects\n- using MonoKickstart\n- creating OS X bundles & dmg's\n- creating Linux packages\n- highlighting specific requirements for Steam and most popular distribution platforms\n\nNot planned (I lack the knowledge):\n- creating an installer for Windows or DesktopGL projects\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4430/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4872","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507242346","x-github-request-id":"AE02:572B:D31E67:1BE5236:59D6A70D","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=53>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=200>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=51>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"a5c99dd9aa16f4ac53c0f24499b691f8\"","status":"200 OK"}}
