Its only for DirectX for now(Windows8). opengl 4.3 i left to future.(oh Opentk is not support it ?)\nFifth mark. I didnt added license(only on 1 file).

below code is problematic under WindowsGL. I have already discovered a fix for it (as shown in the source), but am trying to understand whether I am flat out trying to do things incorrectly, or whether this is indeed a monogame bug.\n\nHere's the relevant code, as succinct as I can make it:\n\n``` c#\nnamespace BackgroundClearRepro\n{\n    using Microsoft.Xna.Framework;\n    using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics;\n\n    public class Game1 : Game\n    {\n        private FakeEntity fakeEntity;\n        private GraphicsDeviceManager graphics;\n        private SpriteBatch spriteBatch;\n\n        public Game1()\n            : base()\n        {\n            this.fakeEntity = new FakeEntity();\n            this.graphics = new GraphicsDeviceManager(this);\n            this.Content.RootDirectory = \"Content\";\n        }\n\n        protected override void LoadContent()\n        {\n            this.spriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(this.GraphicsDevice);\n            this.fakeEntity.LoadContent(this.GraphicsDevice, this.Content);\n        }\n\n        protected override void Draw(GameTime gameTime)\n        {\n            base.Draw(gameTime);\n\n            this.fakeEntity.PreDraw(this.spriteBatch, gameTime);\n\n            this.GraphicsDevice.Clear(Color.CornflowerBlue);\n\n            this.spriteBatch.Begin(SpriteSortMode.BackToFront, null);\n            this.fakeEntity.Draw(this.spriteBatch, gameTime);\n            this.spriteBatch.End();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nnamespace BackgroundClearRepro\n{\n    using Microsoft.Xna.Framework;\n    using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content;\n    using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics;\n\n    public sealed class FakeEntity\n    {\n        private static SpriteBatch secondarySpriteBatch;\n        private Texture2D smileyTexture;\n        private RenderTarget2D secondaryTexture;\n\n        public void LoadContent(GraphicsDevice graphicsDevice, ContentManager contentManager)\n        {\n            if (secondarySpriteBatch == null)\n            {\n                secondarySpriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(graphicsDevice);\n            }\n\n            this.smileyTexture = contentManager.Load<Texture2D>(\"Smiley\");\n        }\n\n        public void PreDraw(SpriteBatch spriteBatch, GameTime gameTime)\n        {\n            #region Working Code\n\n            if (this.secondaryTexture == null)\n            {\n                var graphicsDevice = spriteBatch.GraphicsDevice;\n                this.InitializeSecondaryTexture(graphicsDevice);\n                this.RenderSecondaryTexture(graphicsDevice);\n            }\n\n            #endregion\n        }\n\n        public void Draw(SpriteBatch spriteBatch, GameTime gameTime)\n        {\n            spriteBatch.Draw(this.smileyTexture, Vector2.Zero, Color.White);\n\n            #region Non-working Code\n\n            ////var graphicsDevice = spriteBatch.GraphicsDevice;\n\n            ////if (this.secondaryTexture == null)\n            ////{\n            ////    this.InitializeSecondaryTexture(graphicsDevice);\n            ////}\n\n            ////this.RenderSecondaryTexture(graphicsDevice);\n\n            #endregion\n\n            spriteBatch.Draw(this.secondaryTexture, new Vector2(0, this.smileyTexture.Height), null, Color.White, 0f, Vector2.Zero, 1f, SpriteEffects.None, 0f);\n        }\n\n        private void InitializeSecondaryTexture(GraphicsDevice graphicsDevice)\n        {\n            this.secondaryTexture = new RenderTarget2D(graphicsDevice, this.smileyTexture.Width, this.smileyTexture.Height);\n        }\n\n        private void RenderSecondaryTexture(GraphicsDevice graphicsDevice)\n        {\n            var renderTargets = graphicsDevice.GetRenderTargets();\n            graphicsDevice.SetRenderTarget(this.secondaryTexture);\n            graphicsDevice.Clear(Color.Transparent);\n\n            secondarySpriteBatch.Begin(SpriteSortMode.Deferred, null);\n            secondarySpriteBatch.Draw(this.smileyTexture, Vector2.Zero, null, new Color(200, 100, 200, 255), 0, Vector2.Zero, 1f, SpriteEffects.FlipVertically, 0f);\n            secondarySpriteBatch.End();\n\n            graphicsDevice.SetRenderTargets(renderTargets);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThere are two regions in the `FakeEntity` class, only one of which should be uncommented at a time. When the code is working as expected, it draws a smiley face and another inverted smiley underneath it. The background is the familiar monogame blue:\n\n![screenshot 20](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1901832/347342/733ea30e-9ec4-11e2-89c6-a964e1b1cb4d.png)\n\nHowever, when the working code is commented out and the non-working code uncommented, I instead get a purple background with no secondary texture output (except on the first frame, where it briefly flickers on the screen):\n\n![screenshot 21](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1901832/347343/a40be97e-9ec4-11e2-8125-dfa6ad209677.png)\n\nI managed to track down the cause to the switching of render targets after the initial clearing of the primary graphics device. That's why the `PreDraw` method works - the primary graphics device has not yet been cleared.\n\nNow, I could modify my code to use the `PreDraw` technique and be done with it, but am just wondering whether the scenario above _should_ work. It seems to me it should, because I believe I'm correctly switching render targets, so the primary render target should not be affected. Can anyone confirm?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1628/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1627","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1627/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1627/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1627/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1627","id":12858833,"number":1627,"title":"Some misc changes for the WP8 XamlGame","user":{"login":"Nezz","id":431167,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/431167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz","html_url":"https://github.com/Nezz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-04-05T18:50:14Z","updated_at":"2014-06-14T22:42:11Z","closed_at":"2013-05-18T10:53:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/1627","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1627","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1627.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1627.patch"},"body":"Title says it all :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1627/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1626","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1626/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1626/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1626/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1626","id":12845822,"number":1626,"title":"new RasterizerState(...)","user":{"login":"ronnycsharp","id":1917475,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1917475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronnycsharp","html_url":"https://github.com/ronnycsharp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronnycsharp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronnycsharp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronnycsharp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronnycsharp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronnycsharp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronnycsharp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronnycsharp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronnycsharp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronnycsharp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2013-04-05T13:43:05Z","updated_at":"2014-04-18T00:22:09Z","closed_at":"2014-04-18T00:22:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello,\n\nits not an Issue but a difference between XNA and Monogame.\nI translated my XNA WP7-Project to MonoGame for Android and I\nhad a few new RasterizerState() Initializations in a Draw-Method.\nThats bad.

fixed problem with Game.Dispose and than recreating Game object (http://monogame.codeplex.com/discussions/435932)\n- fixed resume on Windows Phone (#1471)\n\nWhen adding support for rendering to DrawingSurface, a new parameter was introduced to XamlGame.Create:\n\nstatic public T Create(string launchParameters, PhoneApplicationPage page, UIElement drawingSurface = null)\n\nDefault value is added so any existing code will work as it did before; however one can manually specify on which surface to draw, currently drawing surface can be either DrawingSurfaceBackgroundGrid or DrawingSurface. Please feel free to comment/change this change to XamlGame.Create. This is the only public API change, other stuff is internal. One can use same approach as for MediaElement, that is to search for DrawingSurfaceBackgroundGrid or DrawingSurface within UI tree and ditch the third parameter from Create.\n\nEDIT:\nDue Nezz@6ed2156 we eliminated the third parameter from Create so Create method stays the same.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1612","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1612/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1612/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1612/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1612","id":12698689,"number":1612,"title":"Developsinglesolution","user":{"login":"DDReaper","id":1793042,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1793042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper","html_url":"https://github.com/DDReaper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2013-04-02T10:14:41Z","updated_at":"2014-06-16T01:03:09Z","closed_at":"2013-04-09T10:45:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/1612","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1612","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1612.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1612.patch"},"body":"Single solution PR providing a single Windows solution for windows projects and an additional solution for Xamarin Studio\n\n*Note1\nCurrently has a dependency on the split \"core\" pull request for the windows solution\n\n*Note2\nThe Linux Lidgren project has the same GUID as another Lidgren project and causes Xamarin Studio to exclude it on open, until this is resolved a simple workaround is to re-add the project after opening which works fine for builds\n\n*Note3\nDue to limitations with Xamarin studio licensing, the Android and iOS projects have been left out of VS as these require an enterprise license, also projects can only be built individually within Xamarin studio using the free license but still open / work fine\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1611","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1611/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1611/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1611/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1611","id":12692777,"number":1611,"title":"Vector2,3,4.cs -

The ref/out versions of the operations are meant for performance, and unnecessarily calling new Vectorx() then a copy to the result, both takes (a little) longer, and could impact memory usage and garbage collection.
