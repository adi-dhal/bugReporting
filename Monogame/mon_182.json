With the Windows 8 scheduled for release and no comments regarding XNA from the current XNA developers can we be sure about future Microsoft involvement in this framework? Shawn porting various XNA aspects to the native DirectX SDK (of course, after being moved away from the froject: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnhar/archive/2012/06/18/directx-tool-kit-is-now-on-codeplex.aspx) and no hearings on other developers blogs makes me a little bit worried. I don't think XNA's future is sure since it wouldn't be the first time Microsoft makes some of their projects slowly fading away from public eye.\n\nAnd MonoGame's been here for a while now. Slowly growing and buggy at the beginning, but there are at least a few commits daily and even the bigger developers are using it when porting their games to mobile platforms now. You are growing fast. But what are your current sights on the future of the project? Are you just going to incorporate more and more XNA's features and making it available on as many platforms as you can or are you going to reach even further?\n\nYou see, MonoGame is now in very convenient position. Microsoft sponsored creation of kinda revolutionary piece of software (things like advanced shader creation or  _the amazing_ content pipeline weren't available for the average indie developer before XNA's came out, even the most simple-but-annoying things like game timing or modular extensions got so incredibly easy to manage) and gave it away for free. And you (the MonoGame team, that is) are, as the open source community does and should do, making it even more free, may I borrow from Richard Stallman, free as in freedom. Knowledge and thoughts that were put into one single piece of software is being adapted by community. It is a lot of responsibility in case Microsoft abandons XNA, because all the existing XNA's developers would shift to MonoGame.\nAnd what happens when they do? Is MonoGame going to give they the same feeling of safety and support as XNA did? Will MonoGame be a stable, production-ready and developing game framework as XNA was?\n\nIn this fin de siecle of managed game programming, where the XNA was (I hope it still is and will be) the standing ground for many talented programmers, (just look at the people involved in this project and the games that were created with both XNA and MonoGame, Bastion being my favorite) are you going to stand right where you are now and continue with the MonoGame project?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/553/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/552","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/552/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/552/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/552/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/552","id":5236889,"number":552,"title":"Unable to use SoundEffect on iOS","user":{"login":"jjxtra","id":1271832,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1271832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjxtra","html_url":"https://github.com/jjxtra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjxtra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjxtra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjxtra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjxtra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjxtra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjxtra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjxtra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjxtra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjxtra/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":525783,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/iOS","name":"iOS","color":"3200fd","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2012-06-24T16:31:49Z","updated_at":"2013-01-31T10:24:17Z","closed_at":"2013-01-31T10:24:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am unable to load xnb files using SoundEffect on iOS simulator (not sure on device, I don't have a license for mono-touch).

I debugged a lot to day and found out that OpenTK has its own fixedTimeStep logic that was used by MonoGame, while implementing a second FixedTimeStep algorithm in Tick(). I disabled OpenTKs fixedTimeStep as the one provided by MonoGame seems to work _much_ better. This also partly fixes the performance problems I've reported a few days ago.\nIt brings my whole game back to 60FPS with fixedTimeStep enabled and up to 3k FPS with fixedTimeStep and VSync disabled (in the menu). There are still some performance problems left, but now the game at least doesn't feel so sluggish and slow on high-end hardware any more.\n\nEDIT:\nIf you are interested, I did some benchmarks of MonoGame vs. XNA without FixedTimeStep and VSync.\nResults:\nA value of X/Y means, that for my game, I got X FPS in the main menu and Y FPS on average in the game itsself (3D).\n\nOn my Netbook with an AMD Fusion E-450 APU, it looked like this:\nWindows XNA:                                     340/116\nWindows MonoGame:                           310/60\nLinux MonoGame with Unity2D desktop: 55/30\nLinux MonoGame with XFCE4 desktop:  60/43\n\nOn my Desktop with an i7 2600K and an Nvidia  GTX 570\nWindows XNA:                                  5300/470\nWindows MonoGame:                        4450/550\nLinux MonoGame with Unity desktop:  4300/250\nLinux MonoGame with XFCE desktop: 5130/370\n\nFor the Linux benchmarks, the proprietary binary drivers were used.\n\nEDIT2:\nFor the Windows benchmarks, I did not recompile on winows but used the Linux-compiled version as I couldn't get MonoDevelop to run on Windows (well, diddn't really try, but it diddn't work out of the box). So the results might be a bit different from real-world results.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/550/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/549","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/549/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/549/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/549/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/549","id":5228686,"number":549,"title":"Develop3d -

First off all there is no data in the texture yet, so the auto generation is pointless.  Second XNA Texture2D doesn't support automatic mipmap generation in the first place.\n\nIf you have an iOS or Android title with lots of texture content loading you should see a massive improvement in
