Assign the return value of \"smb.BeginInvoke\" (Line 176) and \"smb\" variable to the custom class. Then return this class to the caller.\nThe implementation of that custom class just extract all value from it's IAsyncResult field and return to the user.

After switching over, the game compiles and loads just fine, no errors, but the screen draws black. After pulling some stuff out, it appears to be related to rendertargets.\n\ni'm using the ScreenManager stuff off of the XNA site (pulled it from a farseer demo). the gist is it uses rendertargets for animating transitions. on top of that, i use the crap out of rendertargets throughout my game. Here's the block i messed with (i commented out several lines in two places to get anything to draw):\n\nScreenManager.cs\n\n``` C#\n        public override void Draw(GameTime gameTime)\n        {\n                        int transitionCount = 0;\n            foreach (GameScreen screen in _Screens)\n            {\n//              if (screen.ScreenState == ScreenState.TransitionOn ||\n//                  screen.ScreenState == ScreenState.TransitionOff)\n//              {\n//                  ++transitionCount;\n//                  if (_transitions.Count < transitionCount)\n//                  {\n//                      PresentationParameters _pp = GraphicsDevice.PresentationParameters;\n//\n//                      _transitions.Add(new RenderTarget2D(GraphicsDevice, _pp.BackBufferWidth, _pp.BackBufferHeight,\n//                                                          false,\n//                                                          SurfaceFormat.Color, _pp.DepthStencilFormat,\n//                                                          _pp.MultiSampleCount,\n//                                                          RenderTargetUsage.DiscardContents));\n//                  }\n//                  GraphicsDevice.SetRenderTarget(_transitions[transitionCount -

is based on discussions from these threads...\n\nhttps://github.com/mono/MonoGame/issues/720\nhttp://monogame.codeplex.com/discussions/382915\n\nThe issue is that people want the Game/GameWindow to automatically set the backbuffer size to the client size, but also if they set a different backbuffer size then they want to maintain that ratio when the window goes into the snapped or filled states.\n\nSo with this pull we now...\n- We store a scale between the client size and the preferred backbuffer size the user set in the Game constructor if any.\n- When the client resizes we calculate the new preferred backbuffer size using that scale.\n- We then fire off the application view state event and the client size changed events... this is the users chance to override our settings if they want to.\n\nIt would be great if a few people could test this branch with their own projects before we decide to merge it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/729/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/728","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/728/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/728/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/728/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/728","id":6543637,"number":728,"title":"Don't
