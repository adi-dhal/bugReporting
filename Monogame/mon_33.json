switching from the stable 3.5 release to the latest development build of Monogame, I ran into a few problems. One of them has been resolved already, another has an open issue, #4740, and the last is this.\n\nIn my game, in order to avoid drawing a lot of tiles at once, which was eating up CPU, I set it up so that the tiles are drawn to a RenderTarget2D and the RenderTarget2D itself is drawn instead, and only updated as needed when tiles are added or removed. I initialized the RenderTarget2D something like this:\n\n`blocks = new RenderTarget2D(graphics.GraphicsDevice, 10000, 10000);`\n\nWith 3.5, this works fine. But with the latest build, it throws a SharpDXException, with the following information (I edited out the irrelevant parts of the stack trace):\n\n> SharpDX.SharpDXException was unhandled\n>   HResult=-2147024809\n>   Message=HRESULT: [0x80070057], Module: [General], ApiCode: [E_INVALIDARG/Invalid Arguments], Message: The parameter is incorrect.\n> \n>   Source=SharpDX\n>   StackTrace:\n>        at SharpDX.Result.CheckError()\n>        at SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateTexture2D(Texture2DDescription& descRef, DataBox[] initialDataRef, Texture2D texture2DOut)\n>        at Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.Texture2D.CreateTexture()\n>        at Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.RenderTarget2D.GenerateIfRequired()\n>   InnerException: \n\nFurther experimentation showed that the exception is directly related to the size of the RenderTarget2D being initialized. Constructing it at a much smaller width and height works fine. I did some testing and found the point where the exception is thrown.\n\nThis constructor works fine.\n\n`blocks = new RenderTarget2D(graphics.GraphicsDevice, 4096, 4096);`\n\nThis constructor throws the exception.\n\n`blocks = new RenderTarget2D(graphics.GraphicsDevice, 4097, 4096);`\n\n4096 is a very binary number... That doesn't seem like a coincidence. Is this a bug or a correct limit to the size of a RenderTarget2D?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5018","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5018/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5018/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5018/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5018","id":166598570,"number":5018,"title":"Adds
