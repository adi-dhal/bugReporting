goal of this fix is to remove input lag. It improves on @BrianPeek 's XamlThreads branch.\r\n\r\nA new worked thread is used to run the actual monogame logic and draw loop. This new game thread and the UI thread must not access concurrently to functions in UAPGameWindow.cs, hence a lot of locks.\r\n\r\nThis means that the game cannot render/update the same time as a window message recieved (either the game or the UI thread must wait).\r\n\r\nTo make the UI of the app (UI thread) responsive  the render loop has to be disabled while an UI event arrives, otherwise the game loop has the lock for to long and UI is laggy.\r\n\r\nRight now this fixes only the \"async\" game loop mode for monogame, not the \"sync\" one. It has been tested using an automated UI testing tool for quite some time on real game and currently seems to be working without any problems, but further tests are needed.\r\n\r\nThis also requires that any code that requires to run on the UI thread (eg UWP controls, AdSDK,...) must be dispatched within 2 layers of tasks (this is still something I'm looking into), otherwise the UI thread dispatch call freezes: \r\n1) Start a background thread task from the game thread (the task must not run neither on the game nor UI thread)\r\n2) This new background task must call the UI thread dispatcher if you want to control UI elements, otherwise the UI thread dispatch call waits for the lock, but will never get it since the lock is owned by the game thread, which waits for the blocked UI dispatch call in the game thread and voila deadlock.\r\n(any suggestions for a nicer fix are very welcome, maybe the dispatch call can operate async, WIP...).\r\n\r\nKeyboard input locking is separated from the UI and game loop locks because it has to be more responsive (and is very simple to do so).\r\n\r\nI didn't spend much time finding out why the messages get queued up since some d3d samples use the same approach.\r\n\r\nRelevant older issues/pulls:\r\n#5352

stored in xml files, that were created using XNA Curve Editor fail to build with Monogame's Pipeline tool. Xml of the most simple `Curve `with only one `CurveKey `looks like this:\r\n```\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\r\n<XnaContent xmlns:Framework=\"Microsoft.Xna.Framework\">\r\n  <Asset Type=\"Framework:Curve\">\r\n    <PreLoop>Constant</PreLoop>\r\n    <PostLoop>Constant</PostLoop>\r\n    <Keys>0 1 0 0 Smooth</Keys>\r\n  </Asset>\r\n</XnaContent>\r\n```\r\nFirst problem is that `XmlImporter `in Monogame expects elements in different order. This issue is already described in #4792. I have started making a fix for this when I stumbled on a second problem: \r\n`CurveKeyCollection `is not getting deserialized from xml. \r\n\r\nEach `CurveKey `is represented by 5 values separated by space inside `<Keys>...</Keys>`. \r\nOrder of values is: `Position`, `Value`, `TangentIn`, `TangentOut `and `Continuity`.\r\nEach new CurveKey inside a collection is also separated by space. Two CurveKeys look like this: `<Keys>0 1 0 0 Smooth 0.5 0.5 0 0 Smooth</Keys>`\r\n\r\nDebugging step-by-step I found the point where deserialization fails. `GenericCollectionHelper `doesn't read collection as it expects each `CurveKey `to be a separate xml element.\r\nHere's the `Deserialize `method from `GenericCollectionHelper `:\r\n```\r\n public void Deserialize(IntermediateReader input, object collection, ContentSerializerAttribute format)\r\n        {\r\n            var itemFormat = new ContentSerializerAttribute();\r\n            itemFormat.ElementName = format.CollectionItemName;\r\n            while (input.MoveToElement(format.CollectionItemName)) // this loop expect list of CurveKey elements!\r\n                _addMethod.Invoke(collection, new[] { input.ReadObject<object>(itemFormat, _contentSerializer) });\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nDoes anyone know if there is another class in Monogame that would help to deserialize collection like this? And does anyone with more experience with deserialization have any idea how one would approach to solve this?\r\n\r\nI have many curves in a project I want to migrate and changing all xml files might take me the same amount of time as fixing this code. Also there are [others ](http://community.monogame.net/t/importer-xmlimporter-had-unexpected-failure/7959)reporting the same issue.

This depends on #5486 and assumes the proposed changes there get merged.\r\n  \r\nIf you look at GDM it could be completely decoupled from Game with relatively minor changes. The only thing really stopping this is the XNA API. The GDM constructor takes a Game as an argument so it can check that there's no GDM registered for the game yet and register itself in the games service container (1) and keep a reference for setting window handle in the PresentationParameters (2) and for handling display orientation (3). Let's try to handle these three things without requiring a Game!\r\n\r\n1. I think we should let users manually register the GraphicsDeviceManager. I.e. instead of doing `graphics = new GraphicsDeviceManager(this)` in the Game1 ctor you'd do \r\n```\r\ngraphics = new GraphicsDeviceManager();\r\nServices.AddService(typeof(IGraphicsDeviceManager), graphics);\r\nServices.AddService(typeof(IGraphicsDeviceService), graphics);\r\n```\r\nand maybe shorthands for convenience:\r\n```\r\ngraphics = new GraphicsDeviceManager();\r\nthis.RegisterGraphicsDeviceManager(graphics);\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```\r\ngraphics = this.RegisterNewGraphicsDeviceManager();\r\n```\r\nAdditionally this makes it more transparent to the user what actually happens. This would be the breaking part of the changes involved in this suggestion. We can however smooth the transition by marking the `new GraphicsDeviceManager(Game)` constructor as obsolete and change it so it calls the new parameterless constructor and makes a call to `game.RegisterGraphicsDeviceManager(graphics)`. This way it won't be a breaking change and we can implement it before MG 4.0.\r\n\r\n2. XNA allows users to override the window handle in the PreparingPresentationParameters event, so it can be easily changed. Similar to what we do for other PresentationParameter stuff (like PreferredBackBufferWidth, PreferredBackBufferFormat, PreferredDepthStencilFormat...) I think it would be nice to have a WindowHandle property (public get and set) in GDM. That's more consistent and allows Game to set the initial window handle during initialization (only if the user has not set it yet , so they can do custom windowing stuff). I'd like to do some more research/thinking for this one though.\r\n\r\n3. I haven't looked into MG code for mobile platforms a lot so I'm not entirely sure if the following is the best path, but I do have a suggestion. I think GDM should have a field for DisplayOrientation like it does for other stuff in presentation parameters (I already mentioned some in (2)). DisplayOrientation changes because of auto rotation on a device should change the value in GDM and apply changes. When DisplayMode is changed and `ApplyChanges` is called in code rotating the screen should be handled in `GamePlatform.OnPresentationChanged`.\r\n\r\nThe goal of these changes would be overall a lot more flexibility in using GraphicsDeviceManager. GDM would no longer depend on either Game, GameWindow or GamePlatform.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5487/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5486","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5486/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5486/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5486/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5486","id":208688400,"number":5486,"title":"[DesktopGL] Window not updated when presentation changed","user":{"login":"Jjagg","id":14875382,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/14875382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg","html_url":"https://github.com/Jjagg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-02-19T02:19:10Z","updated_at":"2017-02-25T00:51:55Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In #5429 the DesktopGL platform switched from using GraphicsDeviceManager.Legacy to the newer (and more XNA-compatible) GraphicsDeviceManager (GDM). The way the window should get updated and how it works in the DX path is by overriding GamePlatform.OnPresentationChanged in the platform specific GamePlatform implementation ([WinFormsGamePlatform](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/Windows/WinFormsGamePlatform.cs#L121) for DX). That function is called in GraphicsDeviceManager.ApplyChanges (which is not the best place for the call, but more on that later). \r\n\r\nFor DX we update the window size in WinFormsGamePlatform.OnPresentationChanged. For SDLGamePlatform the function is not overriden at all so the window is not made aware of any changes. Looking at the UWP implementation it seems like it only handles full screen switches and not the window size, I'm not sure how the actual window resizing is handled for that path atm. So the fix is pretty straightforward, we just need to set the window client bounds to reflect the new backbuffer size in the OnPresentationChanged overrides for SDL (and possibly move some code around to do the same for UWP). This is a pretty big bug so it should get fixed ASAP.\r\n\r\nSo after applying that fix, GDM will be responsible for notifying the GamePlatform that the presentation changed which in turn notifies the GameWindow and updates its bounds. There's still two issues here. Well, one actual issue and one thing that's not so much an issue as an annoyance. \r\n\r\nThe actual issue is that you can change presentation parameters without touching the GDM by calling `GraphicsDevice.Reset(PresentationParameters)`, so the GamePlatform/GameWindow will not be notified in that case. IMO we should create a new internal event called PresentationChanged that the GDM subscribes to on its GraphicsDevice and responds to by notifying the GamePlatform of the presentation changes by calling OnPresentationChanged. This event would be triggered right before the `GraphicsDevice.Reset` event, but note that we can't omit the PresentationChanged event and just respond to the Reset event for this purpose because Reset is public (so users can subscribe) and delegate invocation order is not specified in the docs so it's best not to make assumptions.\r\n\r\nThe annoyance is that GDM calling `_game.Platform.OnPresentationChanged` makes GDM depend on a Game, GamePlatform and GameWindow being present. That's crap when users want to provide their own windowing solution, embed MG or even run MG headless[1]. So I suggest we use an event called PresentationChanged - like in GraphicsDevice - in GDM too. Game or GamePlatform would register for the event and respond by calling `GamePlatform.OnPresentationChanged`. It would invoke the event after creating a GraphicsDevice and when its GrapicsDevice invokes its PresentationChanged event (which we're subscribed to). It may be interesting to make this one public so users can easily implement their own windowing solutions without changing MG itself. Of course there's still some other coupling between GDM and Game/Window, but I'll address that in another issue because the changes are more controversial and for a more distant MG release because of breaking changes.\r\n\r\n[1]: There's some additional complications here because some code depends on a window handle being present. We can probably work around it with some effort, but I haven't really looked into this.\r\n\r\ncc @james0x0A","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5486/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5485","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5485/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5485/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5485/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5485","id":208677558,"number":5485,"title":"The Pipline tool does not support /workingDir","user":{"login":"LokiMidgard","id":389101,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/389101?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LokiMidgard","html_url":"https://github.com/LokiMidgard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LokiMidgard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LokiMidgard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LokiMidgard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LokiMidgard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LokiMidgard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LokiMidgard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LokiMidgard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LokiMidgard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LokiMidgard/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-02-18T22:44:03Z","updated_at":"2017-02-18T22:44:03Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I have a project where the assets are located outside the src folder, so different projects can use the same assets.

know MGCB does not support linked files yet and that linked files are problematic, but I'm porting to Android and it seems the \"new\" android MG versions does not support textures with mipmapping compiled from old XNA XNBs, so I'm in need to use MGCB, and file linking is a must due to my folder structure.\r\n\r\nBut even with that in mind, I think this is an issue that should be urgently fixed \r\n\r\nI'm attaching a zip file with an structure of folders.\r\n\r\n[folder1.zip](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/files/784454/folder1.zip)\r\n\r\nGo through the folders to \"project\" and open the project with MGCB.\r\n\r\nThe project only has a file: assets/x.png . Unfortunately linking files does not work, so it's putting it in ../assets/x.png.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that if you try to delete the .. folder (as I did a few minutes ago), not only x.png appears to be deleted, but the WHOLE .. folder... and subfolders. It asks for confirmation, but one supposes that it should be only deleting the x.png file, so I skipped checking.\r\n\r\nLuckily when I did that, all that deleted were my other platform project I had in that folder (which had been commited a moment ago into mercurial) but if I had had that folder in the root on my HD, it'd have wiped out the entire hard disk!\r\n\r\n(in fact it even wipes out the very same mgcb file)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5482/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5481","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5481/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5481/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5481/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5481","id":208536275,"number":5481,"title":"Restrict
