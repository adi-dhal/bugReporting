covers much of the basic XmlImporter functionality. It supports reading from XML into any custom data type it can find in loaded assemblies. It supports all the integral types, generic collections, and the efficient array format for integers, vectors. It also handles polymorphic types and explicit type specifications for elements.\n\nAlso included are XML test data and corresponding classes I've been using to debug it. They're straight out of Sean Hargreaves' [Everything you ever wanted to know about IntermediateSerializer](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnhar/archive/2008/08/12/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-intermediateserializer.aspx). No unit tests yet, but it's a step towards it.\n\nStuff I haven't implemented yet:\n- Custom names for elements\n- Flattened content for nested classes\n- Shared resources\n- External references\n- Error checking for elements that are required to be null\n\nNothing too tough to do, I just ran out of time for now. Later passes can finish off these features. Additionally, if someone needs the IntermediateSerializer, they can refactor this code and create the writing end of it pretty easily.\n\nNote that MonoGame doesn't currently have a ReflectiveWriter so AFAIK custom types will need a ContentTypeWriter defined.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2380/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2379","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2379/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2379/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2379/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2379","id":31837947,"number":2379,"title":"Fixed Build","user":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-04-19T05:08:35Z","updated_at":"2014-07-10T23:28:37Z","closed_at":"2014-04-19T05:16:07Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/2379","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2379","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2379.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2379.patch"},"body":"The PR build of #2372 missed this because the Web platform was added between when it was submitted and when it was merged.  \n\nWe need to greatly reduce our open PR count to fix the PR build process to ensure this won't happen again.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2378","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2378/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2378/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2378/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2378","id":31834927,"number":2378,"title":"MonoGame Documentation Project","user":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":120918271,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/Documentation","name":"Documentation","color":"fbca04","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":25,"created_at":"2014-04-19T01:24:17Z","updated_at":"2015-02-10T10:15:18Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"This next week we're going to start the documentation project for MonoGame.  I'm writing this here to publicly communicate the plan to the community and get feedback.\n## SharpDoc\n\nMonoGame will use [SharpDoc](https://github.com/xoofx/SharpDoc) for generation of class reference documentation as well as organization of hand crafted documentation pages.  I have put up a quick example of SharpDoc results on MonoGame here:\n\n [http://www.monogame.net/reference/](http://www.monogame.net/reference/)\n\nSharpDoc is created by @xoofx for documenting SharpDX.  You can also see it used there:\n\n [http://sharpdx.org/documentation](http://sharpdx.org/documentation)\n## Reference Docs\n\nThe reference docs one part of the documentation process.  Our goal is to surpass the quality of the existing XNA docs by including hints as to the inner implementation of the code as well as platform specific details.  The reference docs should link to or include small code examples when the API usage isn't clear.\n\nOver the next few weeks we will create some documentation examples and tasks for documenting specific classes to help guide contributors as to how to help with the process.\n## Manual Docs\n\nThe docs that are hand crafted for guides, walkthroughs, detailed system explanations, example code, etc will be authored using Markdown format in a new \"Documentation\" folder here in the MonoGame repo.  To make changes to the docs one would fork the repo and then either edit locally on their machine or via the Markdown editor built into GitHub.\n\nThe benefits of this workflow are:\n- Docs are versioned along side the code.\n- Thru pull requests we get a chance to evaluate new and changed docs.\n- Changes to code functionality can coincide with doc changes within the same PR.\n\nAn example of this in practice is how the SharpDX docs are maintained:\n\n  [https://github.com/sharpdx/SharpDX/tree/master/Documentation](https://github.com/sharpdx/SharpDX/tree/master/Documentation)\n## Build Process\n\nWhen we merge code into the develop branch it will kick of documentation generation for both the reference and manual docs on the build server.  The docs will be an artifact of the build just like assemblies and installers.\n\nThen periodically (maybe once a day) we will copy the docs up to the MonoGame site replacing the existing docs with the latest ones.  This will all be automated.\n\nWe will probably maintain docs for each shipped release along with docs for the latest 'develop' branch.\n## Offline Docs\n\nThe docs could also be compiled for offline use either thru a Microsoft Help CHM file, VS2010 style Help 2, or even PDFs.  This is all functionality we would need to cobble together ourselves or add support for it into SharpDoc.\n\nThis would be a goal once we get the docs up and running online.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2377","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2377/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2377/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2377/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2377","id":31802584,"number":2377,"title":"RFC: Add support for ANGLE platform (take 2)","user":{"login":"thefiddler","id":3104289,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3104289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefiddler","html_url":"https://github.com/thefiddler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefiddler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefiddler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefiddler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefiddler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefiddler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefiddler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefiddler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefiddler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefiddler/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":27755158,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/OpenGL","name":"OpenGL","color":"02e10c","default":false},{"id":526188,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/Windows","name":"Windows","color":"f99319","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":28,"created_at":"2014-04-18T14:45:12Z","updated_at":"2014-07-10T20:21:58Z","closed_at":"2014-04-30T10:19:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/2377","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2377","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2377.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2377.patch"},"body":"Right now, testing the OpenGL ES codepath of MonoGame requires an valid Xamarin.Android or iOS license. \n\nThis PR adds support for OpenGL ES on Windows via the [ANGLE project](http://code.google.com/p/angleproject/).

changes to GraphicsProfile.

The correct way to set the profile is: \n1) set graphics.GraphicsProfile inside the Game.actor()\n3) change it on GraphicsDeviceManager.PreparingDeviceSettings event\n2) set graphics.GraphicsProfile and call graphics.ApplyChanges() after initialization\n-Add static GetHighestSupportedGraphicsProfile(GraphicsDevice device) method. \nFor DirectX this will return the highest supported Profile based on the device FeatureLevel. When device is null it will query the (slower?) SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.GetSupportedFeatureLevel(). \nFor all other platforms it will return HiDef, which was the current default. Hopefully this will not cause any problems.\n-When set GraphicsProfile (internally) it will check if it is supported by the device and throw an Exception on error. \n\n_GraphicsDevice.DirectX.cs_\n-Remove code that set the GraphicsProfile after device creation.\n\n_GraphicsProfile.cs_\nAssign values to the enum so it's easier to compare different levels.

This means it will fail to run on systems that do not support OpenGL 3.x+.\n\nThis patch implements a fallback to GL_EXT_framebuffer_object when GL_ARB_framebuffer_object is not supported. (Note that we cannot use GL_EXT_framebuffer_object alone, since many systems support the ARB flavor but not the EXT one.)\n\nChanges:\n- Added `GraphicsCapabilities.SupportsFramebufferObjectARB` and `GraphicsCapabilities.SupportsFramebufferObjectEXT`\n- Added `FramebufferObject`, `FramebufferObjectEXT`, `RenderbufferObject` and `RenderBufferObjectEXT` classes, under `GraphicsDevice.OpenGL.[Framebuffer|Renderbuffer]Object.cs`\n- Replaced direct calls to GL.Framebuffer\\* and GL.Renderbuffer\\* with calls to `GraphicsDevice.Framebuffer.*` and `GraphicsDevice.Renderbuffer.*`\n\nAdvantages:\n- MonoGame should now run on OpenGL 2.1 cards that do not support GL_ARB_framebuffer_object\n- Fewer annoying `#if GLES` regions\n- More consistent error checking\n\nDisadvantages:\n- The new classes use virtual methods to select the correct implementation during platform setup. This is necessary on desktop platforms.

From the 'Implementation on Windows' section of the following MSDN article:\n\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb200105.aspx\n\n'When no PlayerIndex is specified, content is saved in the AllPlayers folder. When a PlayerIndex is specified, the content is saved in the Player1, Player2, Player3, or Player4 folder, depending on which PlayerIndex was passed to BeginShowSelector.'\"\n\nFor the most part this isn't too big of a deal, but for Windows titles trying to keep XNA compatibility, this essentially breaks save compatibility entirely. The commit above is pretty small as it is, but the main thing to pull from it is the `if (playerIndex.HasValue)` changes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2363/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2362","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2362/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2362/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2362/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2362","id":31573532,"number":2362,"title":"MediaPlayer.Volume setter accepts any value","user":{"login":"JamesLupiani","id":916042,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/916042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesLupiani","html_url":"https://github.com/JamesLupiani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesLupiani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesLupiani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesLupiani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesLupiani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesLupiani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesLupiani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesLupiani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesLupiani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesLupiani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-04-15T17:28:52Z","updated_at":"2014-04-21T00:38:03Z","closed_at":"2014-04-21T00:38:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It's currently possible to crank it up to 11 (110%), or to -Inf if you so choose.

I have investigated a little and found out that the GraphicsProfile on startup is set to be HiDef and upon device reset it is set to Reach. The change appears to be in UpdateDevice in this exact line:             GraphicsProfile = _d3dDevice.FeatureLevel <= FeatureLevel.Level_9_3 ? GraphicsProfile.Reach : GraphicsProfile.HiDef;\n\nThanks in advance.
