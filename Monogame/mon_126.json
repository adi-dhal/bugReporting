noticed that there are a few Issues here on GitHub (reported as fixed) that states problem when compiling on Release.\nI've also noticed that these problems are related to Linking process. It only happens when the user assemblies (including MonoGame) are linked.\nThe error occurs here (ContentManager class):\n\n```\nvar methodInfo = typeof(ContentManager).GetMethod(\"ReloadAsset\", BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance);\n```\n\nThe GetMethod method returns null, because it can't find the method \"ReloadAsset\".\nI found this issue on Android, but maybe it happens on other platforms.\n\nI'm not sure why this method is being called using reflection thou, and not directly. I think it's to allow custom ContentManagers, but anyway...\nIt would be great if we hint the compiler to avoid linking this method.\nI did came up with a solution, but I would like to hear somebody else's opinion on this issue, before submitting the PR.\n\nThis is the solution I've came up with:\n\n```\n                if(asset.Key == null)\n                    ReloadAsset(asset.Key, Convert.ChangeType(asset.Value, asset.Value.GetType()));\n```\n\nInside ReloadGraphicsAssets method, inside the foreach loop.\nThis code never gets called, but the compiler is hinted to NOT remove the ReloadAsset method.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2232/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2231","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2231/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2231/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2231/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2231","id":27415697,"number":2231,"title":"Version 3.1.2.0 and Windows Phone 8 Project","user":{"login":"michael1971","id":1705360,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1705360?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael1971","html_url":"https://github.com/michael1971","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael1971/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael1971/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael1971/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael1971/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael1971/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael1971/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael1971/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael1971/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael1971/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-02-12T07:54:23Z","updated_at":"2017-09-21T13:54:03Z","closed_at":"2017-09-21T13:54:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I took the installer for version 3.1.2.0.

The cache needs to be flushed any time a new program is created, since it's possible a program ID will get reused, but that's the only caveat I can think of. Flushing upon creation of a new program is pretty simple given that everything goes through the cache.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2217","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2217/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2217/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2217/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2217","id":27180231,"number":2217,"title":"Game freezes after first Draw call","user":{"login":"ytn3rd","id":904737,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/904737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ytn3rd","html_url":"https://github.com/ytn3rd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ytn3rd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ytn3rd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ytn3rd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ytn3rd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ytn3rd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ytn3rd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ytn3rd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ytn3rd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ytn3rd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2014-02-07T22:39:49Z","updated_at":"2014-02-10T01:49:24Z","closed_at":"2014-02-08T03:29:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Having a weird issue running the standard MonoGame 3.0.1 template on my device.\nWhile the default template may look like it runs, if you debug to the console (or or modify it to make the sprite spin) it will only do the first draw call in Game1.cs.\nThis is only when testing on my device (iPhone5, iOS 7.0.4), testing on simulator will work fine.\n\nSo far I have narrowed it down to Tick within iOSGamePlatform.cs only gets called once.
