I wanted to add my +1 to this idea, and get a discussion going about whether - and if so, how best - to do so.\n\n(As background: up to v3.x, XNA did have APIs for working directly with shaders, but these APIs were removed in v4.0. You could create [VertexShader](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.xna.framework.graphics.vertexshader%28v=xnagamestudio.31%29.aspx) and [PixelShader](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.xna.framework.graphics.pixelshader%28v=xnagamestudio.31%29.aspx) objects, and there were corresponding sets of `Get*Shader*Constant` and `Set*ShaderConstant` methods on [GraphicsDevice](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.xna.framework.graphics.graphicsdevice_members%28v=xnagamestudio.31%29.aspx).)\n\nThe existing - `internal` - `Shader` and `ConstantBuffer` classes already look well-factored to me, and `GraphicsDevice` already has - `internal` - properties for `VertexShader` and `PixelShader`, and a `SetConstantBuffer` method.\n\nOne question I want to ask, and my apologies if this has been discussed already: are there any plans in the medium/long-term to move to a Direct3D 11-style (or more specifically, Direct3D 11 as interpreted by SharpDX) API, where there are separate classes for each pipeline stage? I can see arguments both ways, and it certainly doesn't have to be decided as part of this issue, but I wanted to raise it as it might affect the public API for shaders and constant buffers.\n\nI don't know how controversial the idea of exposing a low-level `Shader` / `ConstantBuffer` API is - there's certainly potential for confusing new users, if you need to choose between shaders and effects.  Any thoughts on this?\n\nAre there are any platforms currently supported by MonoGame that don't support low-level shaders, but do support effects? (I assume not, but it's worth asking.)\n\nAn important consideration is how this will affect the content pipeline. I think it would make sense to make shaders first-class citizens in the content pipeline, with a `ShaderImporter`, `ShaderProcessor`, etc. I suspect there would be more work involved here, than in the runtime side of the API, but if this is the route that we go down, I'd be happy to help. This was always the missing piece back when XNA did have a runtime API for shaders - as far as I know, there was no content pipeline support for these low-level shader objects; you had to compile the shader yourself, and then pass the bytecode to the relevant constructor in the runtime types.)\n\n---\n\n_(This paragraph is not directly related to this discussion, but I wanted to mention why I'm asking for this feature: I have a shader generation system, running as a content pipeline processor, which takes as input a surface shader, and produces quite a few (currently 36) shader permutations. Up until recently, I've been writing all these permutations out into a single temporary `.mgfx` file, and then calling MG's `EffectProcessor` to compile it, and loading it as an `Effect` at runtime (and then converting it back into my own hierarchy of objects so that I can manage the permutations). But now that I need some of those permutations to have different vertex shaders, it's becoming unwieldy to use a single `.mgfx` file. I want to go with the classic uber-shader approach of pre-processor `#define`s, but that means each shader permutation will need to be compiled separately (compiling each shader separately is exactly what the MGFX compiler is doing internally, but that's not exposed, which makes sense, because there's currently no runtime support for individual shaders). My workaround is to compile each permutation into its own `Effect`, but since most of the vertex shaders are the same, that means there is a lot of duplication (unless MonoGame de-dupes at a `Shader` level, but I don't think it does). My ideal situation is to work with `Shader` objects directly, both in the content pipeline and at runtime, because my shader permutation system doesn't really fit into the existing effects framework.)_\n\n---\n\nNow, I realise that this example is fairly extreme, so I'm hoping others can chime in with their thoughts too, so we get a balanced view of how useful this change would be. Obviously, additional public APIs mean additional maintenance overhead, so the decision needs to be made carefully.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3471/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3470","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3470/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3470/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3470/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3470","id":55643832,"number":3470,"title":"New enum docs.","user":{"login":"Chaosus","id":3036176,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3036176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus","html_url":"https://github.com/Chaosus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-01-27T16:56:51Z","updated_at":"2015-01-27T18:29:33Z","closed_at":"2015-01-27T17:37:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/3470","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3470","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3470.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3470.patch"},"body":"Docs for \n-VertexElementUsage\n-VertexElementFormat\n-TextureFilter\n-TextureAddressMode\n-SurfaceFormat\nFix licenses for all of those enums.\nSurfaceFormat_Legacy is renamed to SurfaceFormatLegacy and marked internal instead of public.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3470/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4840","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507242346","x-github-request-id":"9A04:572A:6DC3FA:F6FEE2:59D6A786","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=85>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=200>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=83>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"04f846dac1e1352a64a15f70350791b6\"","status":"200 OK"}}
