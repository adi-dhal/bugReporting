Think of games that don't depend on fast user input like slower strategy or puzzle games. You might want to update the game logic only, say, 30 times a second, while still synchronizing the draw calls to the display's refresh rate of 60 or 120 Hz. During the remaining draw calls, you could interpolate animations or physics to provide players using a display with a refresh rate higher than the frequency of the core game loop with a smoother visual appearance.\r\n\r\nCurrently, it seems like Draw() will only ever be called at maximum once for every Update(). I would like to be able to decouple Draw() from Update(), so that the framework tries to call Draw()\r\n- as often as possible when vsync is off or\r\n- as often as the display allows when vsync is on, ideally matching its refresh rate.\r\n\r\nThis could be implemented via some additional property in the Game class in order to keep compatibility with XNA and the current defaults.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5269/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":2,"-1":2,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5268","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5268/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5268/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5268/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5268","id":186255748,"number":5268,"title":"[Pipeline Tool] FilterView fixes","user":{"login":"cra0zy","id":6773302,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6773302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy","html_url":"https://github.com/cra0zy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-10-31T10:55:04Z","updated_at":"2016-11-07T04:58:09Z","closed_at":"2016-11-07T04:58:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/5268","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5268","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5268.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5268.patch"},"body":"Stuff done:\r\n - fixed items not getting marked successful\r\n - fixed autoscroll not working properly on Windows","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5267","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5267/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5267/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5267/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5267","id":186218270,"number":5267,"title":"Performance improvements to SpriteBatch ","user":{"login":"nkast","id":3018589,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3018589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast","html_url":"https://github.com/nkast","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2016-10-31T07:03:57Z","updated_at":"2017-04-24T19:05:00Z","closed_at":"2017-04-24T19:05:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/5267","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5267","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5267.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5267.patch"},"body":"-Skip Calculations when Origin == Zero.\r\n-Add _texelSize in Texture2D to avoid divisions in SpriteBatch.\r\n Used in calculating  origin & textureCord from sourceRectangle.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent develop (Baseline)\r\n33.83ms (100%)\r\nAvoid extra calculations when Origin = Zero\r\n30.38ms (89.8%)\r\nAdd _texelSize in Texture2D.

Currently, it seems that you have to run a separate MonoGameTests executable found in the output folder of MonoGame.Tests.Windows.

It's also very nice to be able to set breakpoints in your unit tests right in VS, and step through code. VS tests are compatible with nunit, but the tests won't compile if you reference the Nuget version of nunit (http://community.monogame.org/t/monogame-tests-windows-not-compiling-in-vs2015-solved/8320)\n\nIs there a historic reason why the test framework isn't compatible with VS? Do people not like the VS test manager? \n\nI realize that Monogame is a cross platform project, but since the solutions themselves are Visual Studio solutions, it seems logical that the test framework with be compatible with Visual Studio too.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5253","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5253/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5253/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5253/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5253","id":185747043,"number":5253,"title":"Prevent duplicates in ModelMesh.Effects","user":{"login":"jamesford42","id":155688,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/155688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesford42","html_url":"https://github.com/jamesford42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesford42/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesford42/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesford42/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesford42/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesford42/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesford42/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesford42/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesford42/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesford42/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-10-27T18:35:19Z","updated_at":"2016-10-28T21:33:15Z","closed_at":"2016-10-28T21:33:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/5253","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5253","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5253.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5253.patch"},"body":"this resolves #5252 \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5253/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5252","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5252/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5252/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5252/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5252","id":185614299,"number":5252,"title":"ModelMeshPart Effect adding difference between MonoGame and XNA","user":{"login":"KakCAT","id":2372854,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2372854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT","html_url":"https://github.com/KakCAT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2016-10-27T09:15:50Z","updated_at":"2016-10-28T21:33:15Z","closed_at":"2016-10-28T21:33:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have this (very ugly and dirty) piece of code:\n\n```\n\n    // backup current effects\n    i=0;\n    foreach (ModelMeshPart p in mesh.MeshParts)\n    {\n        originalEffect[i++]=p.Effect;\n\n        if (i==2) p.Effect=envEffect2;\n        else p.Effect=envEffect1;\n    }\n\n    // draw\n    mesh.Draw();\n\n    // restore effects\n    i=0;\n    foreach (ModelMeshPart p in mesh.MeshParts)\n    {\n        p.Effect=originalEffect[i++];\n    }\n```\n\nBasically I have a car with basic effect, and I change all the Basic Effects for Environment Effects in the menu screen to show it with environment.\nAfter drawing, I restore the effects.\n\nThis works well with XNA, but there's a side effect in MonoGame.

So, using\n\n```\nif (!parent.Effects.Contains (_effect)) parent.Effects.Add(value);\n```\n\nin ModelMeshPart.Effect setter seems to fix the problem, although I don't know enough of MG to say if this

So I didn't cast the X coordinate of the vector to `int` and the math inside was producing a decimal number (e.g. `250.5f`). This made the following difference in the text:\n![diff](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13241568/19644044/539a8a14-99f6-11e6-90f5-fa57349c18aa.png)\nTop image = decimal X\nBottom image = integer X\nNotice the blurry letters in the top image like `y`, `c`, `e`, etc.\n\nI've actually been wondering for a few days what caused my text there to look blurry, while all other text looked fine. Then I casted the whole thing to `int` and it got fixed. I'm not sure if the behavior is the same with `SpriteBatch.Draw()` for textures too...\n\nFeature request:\nCan we have a `Point` overload on the `Draw()`/`DrawString()` method for positioning? Only reason being that it accepts `int` and `int` only. That way, I'd be sure that whatever logic I put in the position code won't blur the text/image. This can be useful for static (idle) images/text. If one wants to make smooth image/text movement, they should use `Vector2` for position instead.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5242/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5241","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5241/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5241/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5241/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5241","id":184760387,"number":5241,"title":"Add Flush method to the SpriteBatch","user":{"login":"rds1983","id":1057289,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1057289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rds1983","html_url":"https://github.com/rds1983","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rds1983/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rds1983/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rds1983/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rds1983/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rds1983/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rds1983/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rds1983/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rds1983/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rds1983/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":23,"created_at":"2016-10-24T06:39:41Z","updated_at":"2017-02-16T20:57:08Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Right now, if one wants to send the SpriteBatch's draw data to the graphics device and continue to draw (i.e. if he changed the ScissorRectangle), then he needs to call the End method followed by Begin.
