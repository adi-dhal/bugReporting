appears to be some issues with Flick gestures on Android when using MonoGame.\n\nI noticed in my own game that seemingly at random I would get huge spikes in flick \"strength\" on Android. I also found that, in general, flick delta information seems inconsistent; eg. I do the same finger motion multiple times in a row and get different results. These may be 2 different issues.\n\nTo test the issue I ported the XNA Gesture Sample to MonoGame Android.\n\nHere is is the original sample: http://xbox.create.msdn.com/en-US/education/catalog/sample/gestures\n\nAfter testing the Gesture Sample in MonoGame Android, I can confirm that the issue also occurs there. I have recorded a video and uploaded it here:\n\nhttps://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=8F4382671CE40FEA!238&authkey=!AJBQaQdkDymzitQ&ithint=video%2c.mp4\n\nIt is a fairly long video (2 mins), but here is a break down:\n- I am basically doing the same flick gesture over and over.\n- The text on screen shows the value of gesture.Delta and gesture.Delta.Length() when gesture.GestureType is GestureType.Flick.\n- Usually gesture.Delta.Length() is anywhere from 500 to 3000, which is fairly inconsistent unto itself and feels very different from the WP version.\n- At 0:55 you can see the first major spike, when gesture.Delta.Length() jumps to 7000; higher than I am able to get usually even when flicking as fast as possible.\n- At 1:50 you can see the second major spike, when gesture.Delta.Length() jumps to almost 25,000!\n\n![image](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/310185/1828614/ee1eb08c-725e-11e3-83c4-5c0152b56959.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2176/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2175","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2175/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2175/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2175/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2175","id":24871803,"number":2175,"title":"Adding support for Exit() in metro apps.","user":{"login":"ischyrus","id":41187,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ischyrus","html_url":"https://github.com/ischyrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ischyrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ischyrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ischyrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ischyrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ischyrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ischyrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ischyrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ischyrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ischyrus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2013-12-30T02:20:23Z","updated_at":"2014-07-11T00:58:10Z","closed_at":"2014-01-18T05:32:39Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/2175","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2175","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2175.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2175.patch"},"body":"It appears that the Exit() method is not implemented for metro apps.

have noticed that calls to SharpDX functions on WP8 is 3 to 4 times slower than XNA.  \nex: _d3dContext.DrawIndexed() inside DrawUserIndexedPrimitives takes ~3 times longer to execute than calling DrawUserIndexedPrimitives from a similar XNA project on the same device. \n\nIn comparison, due to CPU overhead from sharpDX calls, the same project that run at 60fps with XNA at Lumia 800, drops to 22fps on Lumia 620 with Monogame!   \n\nI though that SharpDX was supposed to be ~x1.5 slower than native DX while XNA was x9 times slower.

MonoGame has timing issues and really should be looked at how the SharpDX toolkit has implemented them. Some developers sense that SharpDX TK has somewhat copied from XNA. XNA is abandoned by Microsoft. I don't see why they would follow up something that looks \"similar\" to XNA. I am no lawyer, but even if they did what could happen? Who would be liable? I would be as simple as removing the \"offending\" code.\n\nThe point of vertical synchronization is so the FPS becomes locked to the monitors refresh rate. Because of MonoGame's tick loops Vsync is not achieved at all. Frames become skipped/jumpy so often.\n\nIf you want a smooth 2D or even 3D fixed 60 FPS step sidescroller, MonoGame at this point in time is still a bad choice.\n\nThe issue comes down to the game loop going out of accuracy due to how stopwatch works. Somehow SharpDX TK handles this fine.\n\nI will be investigating and hopefully adding a fix. It will most probably be based off the SharpDX TK code.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2162","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2162/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2162/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2162/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2162","id":24089229,"number":2162,"title":"Add link to MonoGame-Dependencies","user":{"login":"CompleteBrains","id":5301844,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5301844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CompleteBrains","html_url":"https://github.com/CompleteBrains","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CompleteBrains/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CompleteBrains/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CompleteBrains/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CompleteBrains/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CompleteBrains/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CompleteBrains/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CompleteBrains/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CompleteBrains/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CompleteBrains/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-12-11T06:42:56Z","updated_at":"2014-05-10T04:57:40Z","closed_at":"2014-05-10T04:57:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Please, add the link https://github.com/kungfubanana/MonoGame-Dependencies on prominence.
