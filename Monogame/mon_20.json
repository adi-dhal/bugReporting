While the 2 operations do give different results (e.g. `10f % MathHelper.TwoPi = 3.716815f` and `Math.IEEERemainder(10f, MathHelper.TwoPi) = -2.566371f`), these are accounted for by the additional limit checks. But don't take my word for it, the tests I've added prove that.\r\n\r\nHere are my benchmarks of the original method versus this new one using modulo. The new method takes about 64% less time! But I also added a check to skip the calculations if the value is already within range, and in this case it takes 92% less time than the original!\r\n\r\nMethod | Mean | StdDev | StdErr | Min | Q1 | Median | Q3 | Max | P95 | Op/s | Scaled | Scaled-StdDev\r\n--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---\r\nOriginal | 51.2411 ns | 0.1013 ns | 0.0281 ns | 51.1090 ns | 51.1818 ns | 51.2110 ns | 51.2752 ns | 51.4786 ns | 51.4391 ns | 19515601.45 | 1.00 | 0.00\r\nNew (outside range) | 18.7181 ns | 0.1280 ns | 0.0330 ns | 18.6689 ns | 18.6694 ns | 18.6699 ns | 18.6705 ns | 19.0591 ns | 19.0216 ns | 53424196.85 | 0.36 | 0.00\r\nNew (within range) | 4.1722 ns | 0.0004 ns | 0.0001 ns | 4.1715 ns | 4.1721 ns | 4.1722 ns | 4.1724 ns | 4.1729 ns | 4.1727 ns | 239682313.82 | 0.08 | 0.00","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5412/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5411","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5411/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5411/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5411/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5411","id":200806921,"number":5411,"title":"Custom app icons are overridden by MonoGame icon","user":{"login":"KrytenCoder","id":17113631,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/17113631?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KrytenCoder","html_url":"https://github.com/KrytenCoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KrytenCoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KrytenCoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KrytenCoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KrytenCoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KrytenCoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KrytenCoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KrytenCoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KrytenCoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KrytenCoder/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2017-01-14T14:30:16Z","updated_at":"2017-01-25T14:00:04Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Since I upgraded to dev code I have noticed the application icon for my game is now the orange monogame logo.

You get the color from a file as a string and you have to convert it to Color. Right now the only way to achieve this is to use Reflection which is both slow and error-prone (you risk getting a non-color property for instance, so you have to check) or make a library class (basically a dictionary) and enter all of them on your own. The second solution is fine if you want to support only a handful of colors, but it will become a real chore to input if you want to have all 140 of them.\r\n\r\nI have a few ideas of how to implement this:\r\n1. Use static Dictionary<string, Color> to store the colors. The static constructor will set the colors in the dictionary and the color properties will become just getters that will get the color from the dictionary. This way getting the color will be somewhat slower than it is now since it a lookup in the dictionary have to be made.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```c#\r\n    /// <summary>\r\n    /// Colors library\r\n    /// </summary>\r\n    private static Dictionary<string, Color> Colors = new Dictionary<string, Color>();\r\n    \r\n    . . . .\r\n\r\n    /// <summary>\r\n    /// Transparent color (R:0,G:0,B:0,A:0).\r\n    /// </summary>\r\n    public static Color Transparent\r\n    {\r\n        get { return Colors[\"transparent\"]; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    . . . .\r\n\r\n    /// <summary>\r\n    /// Get color by name.\r\n    /// </summary>\r\n    public static Color Parse(string name)\r\n    {\r\n        name = name.ToLower();\r\n        if (Colors.Contains(name))\r\n        {\r\n            return Colors[name];\r\n        }\r\n        else\r\n        {\r\n            new ArgumentException(\"Color not found.\");\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. The same as option 1 but the color properties have setters which populate the dictionary beside setting the property's field. This way it still have the original performance when getting color by its property, but the code is uglier: a lot of copy/paste and the setter have hidden behavior (adding a value to a dictionary). But I think it is still the better solution since the setter is private.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```c#\r\n    /// <summary>\r\n    /// Colors library\r\n    /// </summary>\r\n    private static Dictionary<string, Color> Colors = new Dictionary<string, Color>();\r\n    \r\n    . . . .\r\n\r\n    private static Color transparent;\r\n\r\n    /// <summary>\r\n    /// Transparent color (R:0,G:0,B:0,A:0).\r\n    /// </summary>\r\n    public static Color Transparent\r\n    {\r\n        get { return transparent; }\r\n        private set\r\n        {\r\n            transparent = value;\r\n            Colors[\"transparent\"] = value;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    . . . .\r\n\r\n    /// <summary>\r\n    /// Get color by name.\r\n    /// </summary>\r\n    public static Color Parse(string name)\r\n    {\r\n        name = name.ToLower();\r\n        if (Colors.Contains(name))\r\n        {\r\n            return Colors[name];\r\n        }\r\n        else\r\n        {\r\n            new ArgumentException(\"Color not found.\");\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Use reflection to find the color. This way the only change made would be to write the methods, but there would be a big performance penalty because of the reflection. Personally, I don't like this solution at all, although probably it's the easiest to implement.\r\n\r\nIf the admins give it a go, I can implement one of the options (preferably the second) and make a pull request.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5406/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5405","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5405/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5405/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5405/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5405","id":199459056,"number":5405,"title":"Typos

I did some cleanup first, so you should only look at the second commit for clarity.\r\n\r\nHere's the situation where this issue occurs:\r\nYou set the register for your samplers in your effect, but don't bind a texture to it. Then you set the textures using `GraphicsDevice.Texture[i]`. Now you apply a pass of a technique of your effect. In [SetShaderSamplers](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/Graphics/Effect/EffectPass.cs#L98) the `GraphicsDevice.Texture[i]` are set to null because the texture parameters of the effect are never set and we do `textures[sampler.textureSlot] = _effect.Parameters[sampler.parameter] as Texture;`. In XNA the textures you set before applying are still there so we should somehow avoid overwriting the value in this case. I'm not exactly sure how to fix this, I think XNA handles this in a completely different way. I'm not sure how/where XNA stores these textures, but it doesn't do it in the effect parameters like MG. When debugging I noticed XNA did not have *any* parameters for the effect while MG has the 2 implicit textures (stored under the sampler names) because there are two samplers. \r\nThat also means that in MonoGame you can do `effect.Parameters[\"s0\"].SetValue(MyCoolTexture);` while in XNA you can only use `GraphicsDevice.Texture[0] =MyCoolTexture1` (which also works in MG).\r\n\r\nAnother kind of unrelated detail I noticed while writing tests for this is XNA throws when you try to apply a pass from an effect that is not the current effect and MG doesn't.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5391","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5391/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5391/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5391/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5391","id":198768145,"number":5391,"title":"Merge
