The process starts, but is stuck at 72KB memory usage and 0% CPU. It doesn't crash and stays like that. No window, nor icon appear, which make me think that the program fails before the Main().\n\nThe only relevant change we made before getting those reports was to update MonoGame to the latest source code. Before that, we were on commit 4d5a7fd, from the 29th September (https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/tree/4d5a7fd8c0971f2fec4e52f40b06f2289874a42c). I've reviewed merged commits since then and couldn't identify a potential cause.\n\nGiven that the process gets stuck at 72KB, it most probably is a problem with the .NET bootstrap (and would appear to not even call the Main()), so it may not be related to MonoGame. But builds prior to the update are still working.\n\nPlayers' environments seem fine, the game was working previously, hence they meet software requirements.\n\nI couldn't reproduce the issue on any of our machines.\n\nDoes anybody already ran into this kind of problem with a .Net app? My best guess would be that .Net is unable to load some assemblies, but it would result in a crash, isn't it?\n\nP.S.: it's a Windows DX project. Also, I've verified all assemblies for corruption, everything is fine. I'm also signing everything, so I don't think it's a problem with GAC and local assemblies.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4266","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4266/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4266/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4266/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4266","id":118736242,"number":4266,"title":"[Gtk Pipeline] Save preferences between restarts","user":{"login":"cra0zy","id":6773302,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6773302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy","html_url":"https://github.com/cra0zy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-11-25T00:59:30Z","updated_at":"2015-12-14T21:34:59Z","closed_at":"2015-12-14T21:19:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/4266","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4266","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4266.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4266.patch"},"body":"Stuff that gets saved:\n- windows size\n- window maximized\n- horizontal and vertical separator positions\n- filter output toggle\n- debug mode toggle\n\nNotes:\n- I didn't save window position since the operating system itself handles that better, ie. multimonitor\n- I used XmlSerialization\n- Gtk already contained \"Settings\" so I named our settings \"PipelineSettings\"\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4265","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4265/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4265/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4265/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4265","id":118736204,"number":4265,"title":"SpriteFont.MeasureString(text) gives incorrect height","user":{"login":"monobeginner","id":16008535,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16008535?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/monobeginner","html_url":"https://github.com/monobeginner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monobeginner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monobeginner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monobeginner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monobeginner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monobeginner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monobeginner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monobeginner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monobeginner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monobeginner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-11-25T00:59:10Z","updated_at":"2016-01-24T23:00:20Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Hey,\n\nI've found bug with method MeasureString(text).

We merged the fxh header files with the original fx file as we are unsure how to compile both fx and fxh files together with the MGFX tool.\n\n``` hlsl\nfloat4x4    UiTransformMatrix   :

tex0.rgb, float3( 0.3f, 0.59f, 0.11f ) );\n\n    c *= tex0;\n\n    return c;\n}\n\ntechnique Technique0\n{\n    pass Pass0\n    {\n        VertexShader = compile vs_4_0 VS();\n        PixelShader = compile ps_4_0 PS();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWe are applying the parameters for the shader in **SpriteManager.RenderLayer()** as shown below:\n\n``` C#\nint textureCount = 0;\n\nif ( pSprite->Texture0.TextureIndex != -1 )\n{\n    GraphicsDevice.Textures[ textureCount ] = _UI.Texture.Get( pSprite->Texture0.TextureIndex );\n    GraphicsDevice.SamplerStates[ textureCount ] = GetSamplerState( pSprite->RenderState.SamplerState0 );\n    ++textureCount;\n}\n\nEffect effect = _UI.Effect.Get( pSprite->RenderState.Effect );\n\n_UI.Effect.GetParam_UiTransform( pSprite->RenderState.Effect ).SetValue( TransformMatrix ); // can't seem to globally set this - humph\n_UI.Effect.SetParams( ref pSprite->RenderState );\n\neffect.CurrentTechnique.Passes[ 0 ].Apply();\n```\n\nWe have already tried using **effect.Parameters[\"Texture0\"].SetValue(_UI.Texture.Get(pSprite->Texture0.TextureIndex));**  and have also have tried compiling this with _vs_4_0_level_9_1_ and _vs_4_0_level_9_3_ but to no avail.\n\nWe draw our data with a dynamic vertex buffer as shown below in the same function:\n\n``` C#\nDynamicVB.SetData(VertexPosition * VertexCount * vertexStride, VertexData, 0, pSprite->BatchCount * VertexCount, vertexStride, dataOption);\n\nGraphicsDevice.SetVertexBuffer(DynamicVB);\nGraphicsDevice.Indices = DynamicIB;\n\nGraphicsDevice.DrawIndexedPrimitives(PrimitiveType.TriangleList, 0, VertexPosition * VertexCount, pSprite->BatchCount * VertexCount, VertexPosition * IndexCount, pSprite->BatchCount * 2);\n\nVertexPosition += pSprite->BatchCount;\n\nGraphicsDevice.SetVertexBuffer(null);\n```\n\nUnfortunately, the best way to reproduce this issue is by downloading [XUI](https://xui.codeplex.com/) and building it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4261/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4260","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4260/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4260/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4260/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4260","id":118312467,"number":4260,"title":"[DX]
