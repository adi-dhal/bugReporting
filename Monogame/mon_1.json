On linux, he cannot get it to close properly. \r\n\r\nCan anyone help investigate? Here is [his original project](https://bitbucket.org/Chris3606/sadcon-closebug) which seems more tuned for linux. I've tweaked it for windows [(download it here)](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/files/1335679/Chris3606-sadcon-closebug-1034adfa2c39.zip) if someone wants to try and debug in Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nOriginally I was able to run the exe without the debugger attached and the window would close.

Create a test app which calls `SetVibration` in every update\r\n2. Plug in a gamepad and run the app\r\n3. Unplug the gamepad\r\n4. Most times the app should throw the exception. If not, try plugging/unplugging the gamepad a few more times.\r\n\r\nThis was mainly because the `_connected` variable was only being updated by the `GetCapabilities` and `GetState` methods. Because of this, it was also possible for `SetVibration` to do nothing if a gamepad was connected after startup without these methods being called first.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes these issues by using the same disconnect timeout logic that the `GetCapabilities` and `GetState` methods use. It also specifically catches the \"device not connected\" exception as it's still possible for it to happen (just much less often).\r\n\r\nI have tested this first in an experimental branch of [my game](http://store.steampowered.com/app/459830/Final_Days/) for 1 week and now in the public branch for the last 3 weeks without any further issues being reported.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5965/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5964","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5964/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5964/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5964/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5964","id":260623708,"number":5964,"title":"[Android] Crash with Samsung S8 \"entire screen\" mode","user":{"login":"mrhelmut","id":3427451,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3427451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut","html_url":"https://github.com/mrhelmut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":525763,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/Android","name":"Android","color":"93ff15","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-09-26T13:29:25Z","updated_at":"2017-09-30T14:48:12Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is a feedback from an independent QA team.\r\n\r\nIt appears that MonoGame doesn't support the \"full entire screen\" mode present on Samsung Galaxy S8 phones.\r\n\r\nGames are crashing as soon as a touch input is registered.

the end of #4796 the [idea was broached](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4796#issuecomment-304155207) of integrating content management into the IDE itself rather than having a separate tool, but the conversation was muddied since the original issue was essentially a complaint about the existence of a content pipeline in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe thing that strikes me about that proposition is it's essentially how XNA worked - within your XNA project you had a Content project (similar to but not the same as the MonoGame setup, where the Content folder contains a magic file called Content.mgcb) to which you added your assets directly; the conversion to XNB files happened at compile-time, and the Visual Studio properties pane let you configure the same things as the Pipeline Tool's properties pane.\r\n\r\nIs the separate tool just for the benefit of users on non-Windows platforms, or are there benefits to having a separate tool for everyone? Is it possible to have the convenient Visual Studio-integrated content pipeline on those platforms which support it and the separate MonoGame tool elsewhere?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5962","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5962/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5962/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5962/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5962","id":260423166,"number":5962,"title":"Fix
