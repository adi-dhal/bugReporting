In the future this can be extended to test for other things. \n\nThis feature is important because when you supply non PoT mip maps and the device doesn't support them, you will GL errors. Also, on Android some devices support them and others don't, meaning you may test your game and have it work fine but once released it will crash on other devices.\n\nThe support for mip maps with non-PoT textures is patchy, but more and more devices have support so it'd be a shame to disable it outright.\n\nSo far I've tested on an iPad 1, Windows 7, Android 4.0 Samsung GalaxyS2, and a MacBook (not pro).\n\nThe only part I'm not confident about is the handling of OPENGL non-GLES platforms (ie desktop PC, Mac and Linux). I took the advice given here: http://aras-p.info/blog/2012/10/17/non-power-of-two-textures/ (OpenGL section), which suggests a more reliable way of deciding on PoT support is whether the card supports 8192 sized textures. This is pretty safe. The only risk is that certain older devices that don't support 8192 textures but do fully support non-PoT textures will have their non-PoT mip maps discarded.

Note that the only two warnings and the first error happened before anything else:\n\nWarnings and Errors before startup:\n\nWarning 1: Reference to unknown project 'MonoGame.Framework.MacOS' ignored.\n\nWarning 2: Reference to unknown project 'Lidgren.Network.MacOS' ignored.\n\nError 1: File not found: /Users/ArcadiaDivine/Dropbox/MonoGame Games/Mechasthesia/Mac/Mechasthesia/Mechasthesia/${ProjectName}Game.cs\n\nErrors when Debugging: \n\nBuilding Solution: Mechasthesia (Debug|x86)\n\nBuilding: Mechasthesia (Debug|x86)\nPerforming main compilation...\n/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/2.10.9/bin/dmcs /noconfig \"/out:/Users/ArcadiaDivine/Dropbox/MonoGame Games/Mechasthesia/Mac/Mechasthesia/Mechasthesia/bin/Debug/Mechasthesia.exe\" \"/r:/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/2.10.9/lib/mono/4.0/System.dll\" \"/r:/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/2.10.9/lib/mono/4.0/System.Xml.dll\" \"/r:/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/2.10.9/lib/mono/4.0/System.Core.dll\" \"/r:/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/2.10.9/lib/mono/4.0/System.Xml.Linq.dll\" \"/r:/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/2.10.9/lib/mono/4.0/System.Drawing.dll\" \"/r:/Applications/MonoDevelop.app/Contents/MacOS/lib/monodevelop/AddIns/MonoDevelop.MonoMac/MonoMac.dll\" /nologo /warn:4 /debug:full /optimize- /codepage:utf8 /platform:x86 \"/define:DEBUG\"  /t:exe \"/Users/ArcadiaDivine/Dropbox/MonoGame Games/Mechasthesia/Mac/Mechasthesia/Mechasthesia/Game1.cs\" \"/Users/ArcadiaDivine/Dropbox/MonoGame Games/Mechasthesia/Mac/Mechasthesia/Mechasthesia/Main.cs\" \"/Users/ArcadiaDivine/Dropbox/MonoGame Games/Mechasthesia/Mac/Mechasthesia/Mechasthesia/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs\" \nCompilation failed: 15 error(s), 0 warnings\n\n/Users/ArcadiaDivine/Dropbox/MonoGame Games/Mechasthesia/Mac/Mechasthesia/Mechasthesia/Game1.cs(13,17): error CS0234: The type or namespace name `Xna' does not exist in the namespace`Microsoft'.

don't think all sampler and render states are supported by the parser yet, but it just ignores any it doesn't recognize. In other words, it may not be done, but it shouldn't break anything.\n\nThe sampler state parsing depends on a pretty specific format (similar to `sampler Foo = sampler_state { };`). It works on all the default effects, and on the effects I use in my game. It's only been tested on Windows, however.\n\nNote: this adds some things to the MGFX binary format. I recompiled the default effects. There are a few samples that will need XNBs recompiled. I already recompiled them to make sure they still work, but I think they'll have to be in another pull request.\n\nAlso note: I accidentally included a change to GraphicsDevice that should be in a separate pull request (multiple render targets) but reverted it back in another commit.
