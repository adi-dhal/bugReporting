am writing a bug after the following discussions as suggested by Tom Spilman:\nhttp://monogame.codeplex.com/discussions/431594#post1008533\nhttp://monogame.codeplex.com/discussions/433005#post1008532\n\nThis is a Windows 8 bug.\n\nThe problem is that the ApplyChanges function called after the screen resolution change ignore the PreferredBackBuffer size.\n\nThis happens when the user:\n- Move the game in the Snapped view state\n- Move the game in the Filled view state\n- Move the game in a separate screen with a different resolution\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Install MonoGame 3.0 installer on Visual Studio 2012 Update 1\n2. Create a \"MonoGame Windows Store (XAML) Project\"\n3. Add a font in the Content folder\n4. Add the following code in the Game1.cs class\n   \n   ```\n   public Game1()\n   {\n       _graphics = new GraphicsDeviceManager(this);\n   \n       UpdateBackbuffer(ApplicationViewState.FullScreenLandscape);\n   \n       Content.RootDirectory = \"Content\";\n   \n       ApplicationViewChanged += (sender, args) => UpdateBackbuffer(args.ViewState);\n   }\n   \n   private void UpdateBackbuffer(ApplicationViewState viewState)\n   {\n       if (viewState == ApplicationViewState.Snapped)\n       {\n           _graphics.PreferredBackBufferWidth = 320;\n           _graphics.PreferredBackBufferHeight = 768;\n       }\n       else\n       {\n           _graphics.PreferredBackBufferWidth = 1024;\n           _graphics.PreferredBackBufferHeight = 768;\n       }\n   \n       _graphics.ApplyChanges();\n   }\n   \n   protected override void Draw(GameTime gameTime)\n   {\n       GraphicsDevice.Clear(Color.Black);\n   \n       _spriteBatch.Begin();\n   \n       for (int x = 0; x < 2048; x += 128)\n       {\n           for (int y = 0; y < 2048; y += 128)\n           {\n               _spriteBatch.DrawString(\n                   font, \n                   string.Format(\"({0}, {1})\", x, y), \n                   new Vector2(x, y), \n                   Color.White, \n                   0, \n                   Vector2.Zero, \n                   0.3f, \n                   SpriteEffects.None, \n                   0);\n           }\n       }\n   \n       _spriteBatch.End();\n   \n       base.Draw(gameTime);\n   }\n   ```\n5. Run the game in full screen\n6. Move the game in Filled View, Snapped View or on a different screen\n\nExpected Result:\nIn the Filled view state and in any screen the coordinate with the maximum values must be (896, 640) in the bottom right corner. \n\nActual Result:\nIn the Filled view state and in any screen the coordinate with the maximum values depends by the resolution proving that the backbuffer is not set with the resolution requested. For example with a resolution of 1920 \\* 1200 the maximum is (1152, 640) that even with this resolution is not what should be. Don't know what this function do but this is not what I expect.\n\nRegression?\nA code similar to this worked last year in November/December but I was using a full XNA game project and using CoreWindows events in order to detect screen changes. I was able to move the game in all the windows 8 views and in different screen and the backbuffer was reset correctly after ApplyChanges.\n\nIn general, fixing this bug want to provide support for developers (like me) who want to develop a Windows 8 game maintaining a fixed backbuffer across all the screens.\n\nThanks\n\nFirst Run - Full Screen\n\n![First Run - Full
