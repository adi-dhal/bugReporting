It would be helpful if I could more easily identify issues that require less knowledge of MonoGame.\r\n\r\nA label like \"beginner friedly\" or \"for beginners\" could very much help with that. As it stands now I woud have to scan through all the issues (at least the ones with \"help wanted\") and then start looking at the corresponding postitions in the code. If I'm lucky I might find something that I feel comfortable working on, if I'm not I have to start that process over. And all of that takes some time.\r\n\r\nWorking in issues that require less initial knowledge could also help increase my knowledge of C# and MonoGame in general so over time it would be possible to tackle bigger problems. \r\n\r\nedit: I should propbably add that I'm not really used to working with labels myself, so if this is actually a thing with the people creating issues then it would be nice if use of such a label, where appropriate, would be encouraged.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5696/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5695","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5695/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5695/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5695/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5695","id":226482170,"number":5695,"title":"SynchronizeWithVerticalRetrace does not work during game in OpenGL on Windows (ver. 3.6)","user":{"login":"JPCZ44","id":16303043,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/16303043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPCZ44","html_url":"https://github.com/JPCZ44","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPCZ44/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPCZ44/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPCZ44/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPCZ44/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPCZ44/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPCZ44/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPCZ44/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPCZ44/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPCZ44/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":185445795,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/Help%20Wanted","name":"Help Wanted","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":27755158,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/OpenGL","name":"OpenGL","color":"02e10c","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/11","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestone/11","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/11/labels","id":1647175,"number":11,"title":"3.7 Release","description":"","creator":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":91,"closed_issues":85,"state":"open","created_at":"2016-03-16T04:39:49Z","updated_at":"2017-10-04T20:19:23Z","due_on":"2017-06-06T07:00:00Z","closed_at":null},"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-05-05T06:06:14Z","updated_at":"2017-09-02T00:46:57Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I switch our project to version 3.6 of Monogame (OpenGL on Windows) and i found that GraphicsDeviceManager.SynchronizeWithVerticalRetrace does not work anymore.\r\n\r\nIt works just on Initialization state - there I can set SynchronizeWithVerticalRetrace successfully, but when I am trying switch synchronisation during the game - nothing happened.
