The trick would be to make sure the test is quick to do and hard to get wrong.  Some core ideas:\n- The test app should be built and distributed as part of the automated build process.\n- The tests should execute in a fixed order.\n- You must complete one test to move to the next one.\n- Should take very little time to complete the tests... less than a few minutes.\n- The results should contain very basic machine info.\n- The tests should work on all our platforms... including phones.\n- Once all the tests are completed it should display the results, spit out a text file, and display a button to copy the results to your clipboard for easy pasting into GitHub.\n\nThe tests themselves should be crafted so that the user has to do the least work possible.  We should ask the user to do something... verify the result wasn't an accident by repeating it...  store the result of the test and move on to the next one.  We **should not** depend on the user to judge themselves if the test passed or not.\n\nThe framework for this should be a standard MonoGame `Game` with some sort of `TestScreen` class that is overloaded for different tests.  The framework would then just find them via reflection, sort them in some consistent order, and run them recording results.\n\nThe usage for these would be in validating PRs.  If a PR changes something that is covered in the manual tests we need people to run thru them on all the target platforms before approval and merge.  We would also run them once before we do a release.\n\nThoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3792","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3792/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3792/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3792/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3792","id":72043301,"number":3792,"title":"Any plan on add a UI system ?","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2015-04-30T02:41:50Z","updated_at":"2015-04-30T20:01:13Z","closed_at":"2015-04-30T02:49:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello,\n\nDo you guys have plan on adding a UI system ?

This is mainly between Mono and .NET. \n\nWe've also found the stock .NET `Random` is pretty slow. Even when doing integer randomization it under the hood uses doubles:\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/src/mscorlib/src/System/Random.cs#L168\n\nWorse MS can't really change the existing `Random` to fix these problems as it could break existing apps.\n\nAlso things like not having a `Random.NextFloat(float min, float max)` makes things inconvenient for game developers.\n\nThis all suggests adding our own `Random` that is aimed at game development needs.  Mainly a fast replacement for `Random` with support for all the data types and ranges. We would also provide a helper template method to randomly shuffle elements in a list.\n- High efficiency.\n- Great distribution.\n- Deterministic when you need it.\n- Can be totally random when you don't.\n- Provide complete set of min/max range functions.\n- Drop in replacement for .NET `Random`.\n- Full set of unit tests proving the implementation.\n\nThoughts and suggestions welcome.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3772/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3771","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3771/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3771/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3771/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3771","id":71182923,"number":3771,"title":"Added few random generation functions.","user":{"login":"Chaosus","id":3036176,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3036176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus","html_url":"https://github.com/Chaosus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":17,"created_at":"2015-04-27T05:23:46Z","updated_at":"2015-04-27T13:15:44Z","closed_at":"2015-04-27T06:42:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/3771","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3771","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3771.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3771.patch"},"body":"I think it is not bad addition.
