shader is compiled, I get `InvalidOperationException` when MonoGame tries to compile the effect under OpenGL / MojoShader, because of this line:\n\n``` csharp\n                // We need the original sampler name... look for that in the symbols.\n                var originalSamplerName =\n                    symbols.First(e => e.register_set == MojoShader.MOJOSHADER_symbolRegisterSet.MOJOSHADER_SYMREGSET_SAMPLER &&\n                    e.register_index == samplers[i].index\n                ).name;\n```\n\nThe reason this fails is because MojoShader is returning garbage in the samplers array.  While the first element of the array is correct, e.g:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/504826/15800817/9ff44cb8-2ac7-11e6-8193-04b6abf5df43.png)\n\nThe second sampler however is garbage data:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/504826/15800820/bb0ff36c-2ac7-11e6-8be9-6677f0b6c918.png)\n\nBecause index is nonsense, the `First` call fails.\n\nThis is probably a bug in MojoShader, and it looks like memory corruption of some nature.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4902/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4901","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4901/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4901/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4901/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4901","id":158498905,"number":4901,"title":"fix

test #4875 I wanted to try the [InstancedModel Sample](http://xbox.create.msdn.com/en-US/education/catalog/sample/mesh_instancing), but I ran into some issues importing a .fbx model. \n- First there was a problem in the ContentWriter about writing a non-.xnb file. This was caused by [EffectMaterialContent.Effect](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework.Content.Pipeline/Graphics/EffectMaterialContent.cs#L14) being serialized, since it's an external reference to a non-xnb file. This was an easy fix, I solved it by adding [ContentSerializerIgnore] above it. \n- Second, there was an error thrown [here](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework.Content.Pipeline/Serialization/Compiler/ContentWriter.cs#L296) because the filename of the reference did not begin with the root directory, which was caused by [NormalizeOS](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework.Content.Pipeline/ExternalReference.cs#L63) in ExternalReference, since it changed directory separators in the ExternalReference so the strings didn't match up. Also an easy fix! I Changed that so it does a regular normalize rather than NormalizeOS (do the separators really matter as long as they're consistent? NormalizeOS is now not used anymore).\n- After that it built fine! However when loading the model it can't find the content reader for ExternalReference<CompiledEffectContent>. This is the hard one :p After digging through the code a bit, I think it should resolve to a regular ExternalReferenceReader, so it can load the file that's referenced (the reader for the effect itself is loaded, so that would work), but I got a bit confused when I saw the content readers include\n  \n  ```\n  {[Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content.Pipeline.NamedValueDictionary`1[Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content.Pipeline.ExternalReference`1[Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content.Pipeline.Graphics.TextureContent]] \n  ```\n  \n  It seems weird to have a reader for a specific generic type like that, I thought a generic reader should read its content and delegate to the reader that can handle it. In this case I would expect a NamedValueDictionaryReader, an ExternalReferenceReader and a TextureContentReader to handle a type like this, each delegating internally to the next. So my question is if I should make the writer when asked for the runtime reader write out the full name of the type (e.g. ExternalReferenceReader`1[[sometype]]) or make [ContentTypeReaderManager.GetTypeReader](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/Content/ContentTypeReaderManager.cs#L59) a bit smarter to use a reader for the outer type when it encounters generics. I really wouldn't go for the first option, but I don't know if the second one is applicable in general (for all generic types). I think we could make it work though, and it would be **a lot** neater. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4884/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4883","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4883/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4883/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4883/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4883","id":157154260,"number":4883,"title":"[Don't merge] WIP replace OpenTK","user":{"login":"mrhelmut","id":3427451,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3427451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut","html_url":"https://github.com/mrhelmut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-05-27T08:20:58Z","updated_at":"2016-05-28T15:44:54Z","closed_at":"2016-05-28T15:44:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/4883","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4883","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4883.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4883.patch"},"body":"This is basically #4874 + https://github.com/mrhelmut/MonoGame/tree/SDLDep which includes installer and template updates.\n\nThis PR is meant to check if everything is fine and that the artifacts build and pass the tests.

the current implementation of the SDL back end we list ALL\nthe displaymodes for evey display. I need to check with XNA but\nit seems we should only list the modes for the current display. Otherwise\nyou might end up trying to set a mode which isn't supported.\n\nAnyone with XNA able to confirm the DisplayMode list is for the \"current\" display only.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4887","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507242346","x-github-request-id":"ACEB:572C:1569057:2A8643A:59D6A6D7","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=38>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=200>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=36>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"9fffe0f90f31ef50b2349eb2c5a371a9\"","status":"200 OK"}}
