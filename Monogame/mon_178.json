Windows 8 you have to hook up the Window.ClientSizeChanged event to check if the ApplicationView.Value is Snapped or Filled, but some of the last PR added a bug to it. This is what I was doing:\nthis.Window.ClientSizeChanged += Window_ClientSizeChanged;\nAnd the handler has doing this:\n            if (ApplicationView.Value == Windows.UI.ViewManagement.ApplicationViewState.Snapped)\n            {\n                graphics.PreferredBackBufferWidth = 320;\n                graphics.PreferredBackBufferHeight = 800;\n                graphics.ApplyChanges();\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                graphics.PreferredBackBufferWidth = 1280;\n                graphics.PreferredBackBufferHeight = 800;\n                graphics.ApplyChanges();\n            }\n            this.GraphicsDevice.Viewport = new Viewport(0, 0, graphics.PreferredBackBufferWidth, graphics.PreferredBackBufferHeight);\n\nBut now if I call ApplyChanges, screen turns Black and stops showing anything. I realized that this happens until I change the RenderTarget, so I think this have something to do with the graphics not updating correctly.\nTo fix it I just stoped calling ApplyChanges, and it IS working, but not the expected code behaviour.\nAnyone knows what may be causing this?\n\nTnx in
