This is basically the same tutorial from XNA's StencilsCratersTutorial.\n\nThere are two Game implementations included.  \n- GameSpriteBatch - using a sprite batch.  Works on all platforms\n- GameDrawPrimitives - using DrawUserIndexPrimitives to implement the same functionality as the first but does not work on iOS and Mac.  Also, does not use RenderTargets but that should not matter.\n\nTo see the differences just change:\n\n```\n        var game = new GameDrawPrimitives();\n```\n\nto \n            var game = new GameSpriteBatch();\n\nWhen the planet comes up just touch around on the planet and there should be holes cut into the planet.  On iOS using SpriteBatch it works fine but doing the same with DrawUserIndexedPrimitives it is not working.  Have tested on all windows platforms and they seem fine as well.\n\nYou can find a link to the project file here: [StencilCratersTutorial3](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tjys5njhslczwvh/StencilsCratersTutorial3.zip?dl=0)\n\nAny help in getting this working would be greatly appreciated.\n\nAlso, let me know if another platform implementation would be necessary and I will provide it.\n\nYou can find a link to the project file here: [StencilCratersTutorial3](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tjys5njhslczwvh/StencilsCratersTutorial3.zip?dl=0)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3943/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3942","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3942/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3942/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3942/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3942","id":88817564,"number":3942,"title":"Fullscreen mode not working correctly in Windows10 UAP","user":{"login":"aalmik","id":10566566,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10566566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalmik","html_url":"https://github.com/aalmik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalmik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalmik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalmik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalmik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalmik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalmik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalmik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalmik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalmik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-06-16T19:30:09Z","updated_at":"2015-08-22T14:15:07Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I am not able to get full screen mode working in Windows 10 UAP in Visual Studio 2015.

hope my conclusion of what the issue should be is correct, but to be sure I will elaborate more.\nAs I was searching how to draw strings I found a lot of old methods that have been replaced by the new MonoGame Content Pipeline now. To create a .spritefont file with the Pipeline is pretty straightforward and gives no problems, but then it needs to be loaded.\nUsing content.Load<SpriteFont> throws a NotImplementedException because this leads to a call to ReadRasAsset, which throws that exception when the Type is SpriteFont (with a contruction of a SpriteFont in comment).\nIf I am correct this means that there is no way to load SpriteFonts at the moment and as you need a SpriteFont to draw a string it is also impossible to draw text at the moment. Thus it is important that this is implemented soon.\n\nLooking at the created .spritefont file however I wonder if the SpriteFont class is meant to be abolished.  I thought this because it states <Asset Type=\"Graphics:FontDescription\">, leading me to think that the type is to be changed to FontDescription. This type does not exist yet however. I was not able to find anything about this possible change however.\n\nFinally I'm sorry if I just misunderstood the way drawing strings must be done now and I simply addressed problems that are not there. I would like to hear so if this is the case however.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3935","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3935/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3935/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3935/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3935","id":88380786,"number":3935,"title":"Isue

In the second situation, it will correctly open the project but it will fail to locate mgcb.exe when you try to build.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3926/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3925","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3925/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3925/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3925/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3925","id":87329184,"number":3925,"title":"Fix for Curve.Evaluate ArgumentOutOfRangeException","user":{"login":"PumpkinPaul","id":1307164,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1307164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PumpkinPaul","html_url":"https://github.com/PumpkinPaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PumpkinPaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PumpkinPaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PumpkinPaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PumpkinPaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PumpkinPaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PumpkinPaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PumpkinPaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PumpkinPaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PumpkinPaul/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-06-11T12:28:57Z","updated_at":"2015-06-24T03:35:56Z","closed_at":"2015-06-24T03:35:56Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/3925","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3925","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3925.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3925.patch"},"body":"A call to Curve.Evaluate will throw an ArgumentOutOfRangeException if no keys have been added to the curve.

Test fails with `ContentLoadException : Content reader could not be found for CustomEnum type.`\n\nThe issue was that when compiling the xml, the custom class gets a `ContentTypeWriter`, but it's `ReflectiveSerializer` is never created because there are no items in the list, which means the `ContentTypeWriter`s for the custom class members are not created. At load time, the reader is created but the element readers can not be found (even though they were not needed!)\n\n[EDIT]\nI've found a better way to resolve this. Now, all element and generic arg type writers get added to the `ContentTypeWriter` at the time that their parent writer is added. This is done by the new `internal virtual void OnAddedToContentWriter(ContentWriter)` method. The new virtual method was necessary because using `Initialize` was no good as the `ContentWriter` reference is needed and using `Write` is no good because it won't always be called (empty lists etc).\n\nAlso managed to remove this comment :)\n\n```\n             // TODO: This is kinda messy.. seems like there could\n             // be a better way for generics and arrays to register\n             // their inner types with the typeWriterMap\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3923/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3922","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3922/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3922/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3922/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3922","id":86918494,"number":3922,"title":"[SkinnedModelProcessor]
