maybe a bit early for this post but in consideration of the proposed addition of emoji characters. In #4805 i suppose i should post this as Spritefont is up for changes\n\nIll begin by stating i have reduced the spritefont.DrawInto methods matrix calculations. \nAs a result of trying to allow for a culling boundary rectangle to be added to a custom drawString method. I have come to realize, the Spritefont class is a bit poorly structured in relation to Spritebatch.\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1zD887frY04bkJkU3hEMmZoT1k\n\nInternal Measurestring, Drawinto, Charsource, are tightly coupled and both the Charsource struct in Spritefont and Drawinto are tightly coupled to Spritebatch. \nBasically Spritefont holds some Spritebatches responsibility were it should not.\n\nIf we could bypass DrawInto with our own Drawstring then pass the results to DrawInternal.. \nFrom this we could then create our own custom methods that manipulate text in unique ways.\n\n<img src=\"http://community.monogame.net/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b746a8b40b72d3c734e7191dd321ccfaeac81c08.png\">\n\n<img

propose the following be considered, \nThe charsource struct.\nThe internal measurestring .\nThe method Drawinto \nAll be moved to the Spritebatch class. \n\nFurther that DrawInto is simply a internal Drawstring and it be possibly renamed to reflect that. \n\nAlso considering the possibility that the struct Charsource maybe redundant as well as it is not preventing garbage from being produced and collected.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4812/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4811","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4811/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4811/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4811/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4811","id":151683633,"number":4811,"title":"VideoPlayer.WMS

tried to add Hi-DPI / Retina support to the new `SDLGameWindow` but it turns out it is way more complicated than just adding the `Sdl.Window.State.AllowHiDpi` creation flag to the window.\n\nI lack the OS X understanding and unlimited access to a Retina, and I don't get what OS X is expecting when it comes to backbuffer, window and viewport size. Their virtual DPI system is totally different from other systems and the documentation didn't quite helped me. There are some design decisions to take as well, because setting a 2880x1800 resolution may end up to a 1440x900 viewport, which is misleading compared to what XNA users are used to and specific to OS X. Do we want this? Do we need some virtualisation?\n\nRight now, `GraphicsDeviceManager.HardwareModeSwitch = true` renders a black screen on any Retina displays, while the borderless mode displays games only on 1/4th of the screen (on the lower left). This means that it is a regression compared to OpenTK (which was supporting Hi-DPI, but only correctly working with the desktop resolution, or borderless).\n\nI wouldn't mind some help on this front, or any hints on how OS X works with Hi-DPI, OpenGL and SDL2. ( @tomspilman mind adding the \"help wanted\" tag?)\n\nNote that on Windows, enabling Hi-DPI is as simple as adding a manifest to enable it. No other action is required and it works as expected. I'll push a PR to add this to the DesktopGL template.\n\n@dellis1972 Did you have any issues with Retina on the latest SDL changes?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4801","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4801/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4801/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4801/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4801","id":150755982,"number":4801,"title":"Only use Default implementation on older Mac APIs","user":{"login":"hach-que","id":504826,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/504826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que","html_url":"https://github.com/hach-que","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-04-25T05:52:59Z","updated_at":"2016-04-25T07:33:04Z","closed_at":"2016-04-25T07:33:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/4801","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4801","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4801.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4801.patch"},"body":"This allows Xamarin.Mac to build again without introducing any regressions in the current behaviour.

`AssemblyInfo.Android.cs` etc.  This allows for PS4 and other platforms to add their own custom assembly attributes.\n\nThe `Copyright © 2011-2016` should be changed to `Copyright © 2009-2016 MonoGame Team` which matches when the MonoGame project started.\n\nWe should set `AssemblyCompany` to `MonoGame Team`.\n\nWe should set the `AssemblyTrademark` to `MonoGame® is a registered trademark of the MonoGame Team`.\n\nAlso everything discussed here should be done for the pipeline assembly info as well.  We should be sure that the new PCL portable assemblies have their info modified to mark them clearly as PCL and not for a particular platform.\n\nAny other cleanups we need to do here?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4798","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4798/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4798/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4798/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4798","id":150702426,"number":4798,"title":"MonoGame tvOS now compiles.
