bug is in the WinDX platform layer, I haven't looked at the others yet.\n\nIf you want to repro it the way I found it, it's also _really_ obscure, but the fact that it can happen at all is bad enough, right?\n\nI was mucking around with what was left of the project template, and the call to Game.Exit ended up on the main code path. Imagine\n\n``` C#\nprotected override void Update(GameTime gameTime)\n{\n    Exit();\n    base.Update(gameTime);\n}\n```\n\nThat alone doesn't cause the bug though. For various reasons, I also had the [Visual Studio hosting process disabled](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms185330.aspx).\nThese two combined will have the game window pop up, close immediately and then indefinetely continue to run. Hitting the pause button in the debugger, I got this stack trace:\n\n```\nmscorlib.dll!System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(int millisecondsTimeout)\nMonoGame.Framework.dll!MonoGame.Framework.WinFormsGameWindow.RunLoop()\nMonoGame.Framework.dll!Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game.Run(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.GameRunBehavior runBehavior)\nGame1.exe!Game1.Program.Main()\n```\n\nI assumed that Thread.Sleep was unlikely to be the cause of the infinite loop, so I looked at WinFormsGameWindow.cs. Looking at RunLoop(), there's only one call to Thread.Sleep, and it's inside [this loop](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/Windows/WinFormsGameWindow.cs#L435-451).\nCompared to the loop above it, it simply seems to lack `Application.DoEvents()` to actually pull out messages from the queue, but I have not tested this yet. I'm not sure why this seemingly never caused any issues before, but I assume calling Exit on the first update doesn't give the first loop enough time to clear the queue, and the queue would usually be empty anyway, unless the the hosting process is disabled?\n\nBut that's just conjecture. Unless one of the devs thinks it's obvious enough and fixes it themselves, I'll try and fix this myself and make a pull request later today or maybe tomorrow.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3995/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3994","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3994/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3994/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3994/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3994","id":94504199,"number":3994,"title":"Fixed

I have my monogame projects in git I woul prefer to use Nuget-Packages instead of installations for better dependecy handling. Unfortunatly the NuGet-Package for MonoGame does not provide the content pipeline tool, so I needed to install MonoGame from the installer too. This is bad because now I have MonoGame twice installed + probably some issues when I switch to a different MonoGame Version in NuGet.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3985/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3984","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3984/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3984/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3984/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3984","id":93134042,"number":3984,"title":"Bug with Monogame SpriteFont Importer","user":{"login":"DindleBug","id":11158981,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11158981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DindleBug","html_url":"https://github.com/DindleBug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DindleBug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DindleBug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DindleBug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DindleBug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DindleBug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DindleBug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DindleBug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DindleBug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DindleBug/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":13477514,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/ContentPipeline","name":"ContentPipeline","color":"ededed","default":false},{"id":185445795,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/Help%20Wanted","name":"Help Wanted","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":13,"created_at":"2015-07-05T18:29:54Z","updated_at":"2015-10-23T05:02:36Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Been having a problem with displaying Japanese characters in my app ever since using the monogame pipeline.\n\n![help for charracters](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11158981/8512806/23c806f8-234c-11e5-88e4-4beced7ac4e2.jpg)\n\n So I look and found that the spriteFonts are imported by a new importer.
