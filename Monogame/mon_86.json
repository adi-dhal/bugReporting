The _view is required by the constructor, and seems to work properly when I switch to using it. I can try to dig down further into removing `View` if it isn't needed.\n\nHere's a sample .mgcb file that caused the error:\n\n```\n/outputDir:bin\n/intermediateDir:obj\n/platform:Linux\n/config:AnyCPU\n/profile:Reach\n/compress:False\n/incremental\n```\n\nThe /incremental is invalid and it crashes trying to read it. This happens both at startup (opening file from history) and just doing file -> open. After this change the error message is displayed in the middle.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3431/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3430","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3430/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3430/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3430/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3430","id":54713868,"number":3430,"title":"SpriteFont Texture Color are swapped from RGBA to BGRA even if processor is set to Color","user":{"login":"Eversor","id":733699,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/733699?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eversor","html_url":"https://github.com/Eversor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eversor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eversor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eversor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eversor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eversor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eversor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eversor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eversor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eversor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2015-01-18T23:03:47Z","updated_at":"2015-01-28T00:06:22Z","closed_at":"2015-01-28T00:06:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This is a reproducible issue in Windows (dx AND gl).\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/yuiip7y8nibry9c/FontBuildIssue.zip?dl=0\n\nThis is a project that basically shows the issue, the font is a number font from our game, i colored it to show the problem: \n1) at the top you can see the original texture from wich the font should be drawn (SpriteBatch.Draw)\n2) the second and third line shows the actual result: R and B are swapped.

But I noticed while working in `VertexBufferTest.cs` that, when running these tests under XNA, the test window is never shown and the `DrawWith` event handler is never called, and so the test gives a false positive.\n\nOnly a few tests use this pattern:\n- `IndexBufferTest.cs`\n- `Texture2DTest.cs`\n- `Texture3DTest.cs`\n- `VertexBufferTest.cs`\n\nThe simplest fix is to replace these calls to `Game.RunOneFrame()` with `Game.Run()`. This works because the tests use a custom `Game` class, which defines a new `Run` method, which exits the game after some condition evaluates to true. By default, that condition is \"exit after drawing one frame\". So within the context of these tests, `Game.Run()` does exactly the same thing as `Game.RunOneFrame()`.\n\nIf, instead, we want to find the root cause so that we can continue using `RunOneFrame`, then... looking in the debugger immediately after `Game.RunOneFrame()` has been called, I can see that `IsActive`, as well as `doneFirstUpdate`, `doneFirstDraw`, etc. are all `false`. I have tried calling `Initialize` before `RunOneFrame`, but that doesn't help.\n\nI can see in MG's implementation of `RunOneFrame()` that we initialise the game if it hasn't already been initialised. My best guess is that XNA doesn't do this - it expects the game to already be initialised (which it does in `Run`, but apparently not in `RunOneFrame`) . But I don't know enough about the XNA `Game` class to know how to do that initialisation. (Or put another way, I'm not sure how XNA's `RunOneFrame` is intended to be used at all.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3423/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3422","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3422/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3422/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3422/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3422","id":54672014,"number":3422,"title":"Can't create project with type: IPhone - Xamarin Studio Error","user":{"login":"TheRubble","id":482262,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/482262?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheRubble","html_url":"https://github.com/TheRubble","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheRubble/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheRubble/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheRubble/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheRubble/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheRubble/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheRubble/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheRubble/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheRubble/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheRubble/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-01-17T19:22:40Z","updated_at":"2015-01-18T06:29:45Z","closed_at":"2015-01-18T06:29:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I've downloaded MonoDevelop.MonoGame_3.2.0.100.mpack, and installed into Xamarin Studio 5.

On the 3D side we have a BoundingBox, BoundingSphere and even a BoundingFrustrum and on the 2D Side we only have a Rectangle. \n\nI've always found this odd with XNA considering that Circles play an integral role in collision detection within the 2D Space. Not only are they fast to compute, but they can easily handle common situations in games such as rotated sprites. Since MonoGame is an opened source project, I figured I would see if I could get this basic addition added to the MonoGame framework. \n\nWithin this pull request I have written the Circle and Tests pertaining to it. If there are any problems let me know and I'm willing to solve them because I think that a fully featured Circle would be an extremely useful addition to MonoGame\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3419/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3418","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3418/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3418/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3418/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3418","id":54650722,"number":3418,"title":"iOS 8 rotation handling for iPad and when Info.plist is > SupportedOrientations","user":{"login":"rtabbara","id":3273442,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3273442?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtabbara","html_url":"https://github.com/rtabbara","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtabbara/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtabbara/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtabbara/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtabbara/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtabbara/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtabbara/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtabbara/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtabbara/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtabbara/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2015-01-17T04:51:01Z","updated_at":"2015-01-20T19:50:09Z","closed_at":"2015-01-20T19:50:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/3418","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3418","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3418.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3418.patch"},"body":"Having another crack of this as I realised I previously didn't correctly read the original issue encountered in #3271 by @Nezz. So there were actually two separate issues:\n1. iOS 8 rotation problems when targeting iPad when you allow _both_ landscape/portrait rotations. This was something other people in the discussion of #3271 were encountering and that was what my previous fix was targeting.\n2. The original issue @Nezz was describing was the case where you're Info.plist is a superset of those specified in the root view controller's supported orientations. So e.g. Info.plist is portrait/landscape but you want the root view controller to only support landscape orientations. In this instance, the behaviour should be that the app launches in landscape.\n\nSo I've appended my original fix for 1. along with another fix for 2. I've tried a number of iPad/iPhone simulated devices targeting iOS 7.1/8.1 so I'm hopeful that this solves the issues.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3418/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3417","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3417/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3417/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3417/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3417","id":54645367,"number":3417,"title":"Fixes OpenTK warnings","user":{"login":"prollin","id":502478,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/502478?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin","html_url":"https://github.com/prollin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2015-01-17T01:27:36Z","updated_at":"2015-01-22T02:25:34Z","closed_at":"2015-01-22T02:25:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/3417","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3417","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3417.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3417.patch"},"body":"Fixes a bunch of OpenTK related warnings that were introduced by the support of Xamarin Unified API (#3382).

After installing VS2013 (which includes Windows SDK 8.1 -- which itself include DirectX SDK ---), I tried to compile a MonoGame project targeting Windows DX.\n\nI stumbled upon an mgcb/pipeline error when building shaders: `Unable to load d3d_compiler_43.dll`\n\nThis dll/compiler is present in the discontinued DirectX SDK from June 2010.\n\nShader compiler are now redistributed with the Windows SDK (the 8.1 SDK packs version 47) since Vista, I believe.\n\nThe problem is that mgcb refers to a dll which may not be present on all setup and installing an outdated DirectX SDK may not suit every dev.\nMaking mgcb to search where the shader compiler is installed may be also tedious since the path is different from every Windows SDK version.\n\nThe DirectX SDK EULA and documentation (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ee663275.aspx) states that any project using run-time shader compilation can be redistributed with the proper compiler dll/version. Would it be safe to do so with MonoGame installer? That would remove any dependencies for setting up MonoGame projects targeting Windows.\n\nLet me know if that makes sense and I'll see if can manage to make the change to mgcb and the
