Even worse, a usual player that owns 3D Vision may not even have the idea that the graphic glitches he is seeing may be related to 3D Vision, he forgot to deactivate.\n## Symptoms\n\nSo now for the issue itself. After experiencing random graphic glitches I wrote a sample code as simple as possible (see below). In order to run it you will need\n1. a new plain Windows Desktop monogame project\n2. a resource file named \"pixel.xnb\" which is a 2D-Texture that simply contains a single black pixel.\n\nWhat it does is to draw a horizontal black line with a height of 5 pixels on a white background and move it vertical in steps of 5 pixels every frame. Works perfectly with 3D Vision deactivated but if 3D Vision kicks in the following happens:\n\n![timingglitch](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13534999/8926879/966c40c4-3513-11e5-91e5-6c76f57c98c8.jpg)\n\nIt turned out that it was impossible to get a regular screenshot from the glitch, so I needed to take a photograph of my screen. So please ignore the unsharp grey stripes - they are a side-effect of taking a photograph of the screen and not really there. What is the real glitch are the 3 thin horizontal lines, there only should be one, which is the lowest of them.\n\nIf you could see the movement: The glitch lines appear to be flickering (I think about 20 times/second, see my theory below). But taking a video of the glitch is even more impossible (120 Hz video camera, anyone? :D ). Then the glitch lines change their position at random points of time.\n\nLooking through my 3D glasses it appeared that the glitch lines are only in the half-picture intended for the right eye, the left eye looks normal.\n## Theory\n\n After some research about the internal workings of DirectX graphics and how Monogame uses it I came up with the following theory how this happens:\n1. Monogame creates a swapchain in the video memory which consists of a screen buffer and 2 back buffers\n2. since 3D Vision needs 2 half-pictures it creates secondary buffers for the right eye. It doesnt tell the application anything about that (wouldn't be possible with older 3D games that are automatically converted into stereo 3D)\n3. When a Frame should be drawn, Monogame sends draw instructions to the graphics card and waits until they are executed, then presents the next buffer in the swapchain.\n4. Monogame (or SharpDX?) uses some unusual way to determine when the draw operations are finished. At least I assume it must be unusual since I never noticed the same problem in other 3D games. The call returns when the first buffer has been drawn, the secondary buffer has not yet been drawn.\n5. Under normal circumstances the next Frame is drawn now. If that happens the preceding draw operations are cancelled. The secondary buffer remains unchanged.\n6. only at random times (for example when the operating system gives cpu time to another thread or process) the graphics card is given enough time to execute the drawing operations for the seondary buffer. Then the secondary buffer is changed.\n7. The screen is presented with the contents of the primary and secondary buffers. Since the secondary buffer contains an old version of the drawing from some random point of time in the past, a flickering ghost will appear. Since there are 3 secondary buffers it flickers at a rate of\n   \n   120 Hz / 2 (half pictures/second) / 3 (buffers/half-picture) = 20 Hz\n   \n   There are up to 3 ghosts, because we have 3 secondary buffers.\n## Workaround\n\nTo test my theory I just gave the graphics card more time to finish by adding a Thread.Sleep() to the draw cycle. To test remove the slashes from the line `Thread.Sleep( (int)gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalMilliseconds/8);` in my code sample. I found the appropriate amount of time with trial and error, it may be system dependent.\n\nOn my system this removes all the graphic glitches.\n## Suggestions for Solution\n\nThe second best solution would be to deactivate 3D Vision in Monogame completely. There is an API (nvapi.dll) that allows game developers to control 3D vision, so Monogame would need to check wether it is present and make the appropriate calls.\n\nThe best solution would be of course to fix the source of the problem since this would allow to write 3D-vision compatible games with Monogame.\n## Code\n\n``` csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Threading;\nusing

I'll try and include as much detail as I can so this is probably going to be a bit long. I downloaded the MonoGame sources to try and debug, but I'm hitting a wall and I'm hoping someone can help me sort this out.\n\nI have a CoolingSystem<T> class, a Weapon class, a Projectile class and an Asset<U> class. T is ITemperatureModule, which Weapon inherits. U is a Sprite class. CoolingSystem<T> does not have any properties of type Weapon nor T. Weapon has a public property of List<Asset<Projectile>>.\n\nAsset<U> has a custom ContentWriter and ContentReader.\n\n```\n    [ContentTypeWriter]\n    public class AssetWriter<T> : ContentTypeWriter<Asset<T>>\n    {\n        protected override void Write(ContentWriter output, Asset<T> value)\n        {\n            output.Write(value.Name);\n            output.Write(value.Path);\n        }\n\n        public override string GetRuntimeReader(TargetPlatform targetPlatform)\n        {\n            return typeof(AssetContentReader<T>).AssemblyQualifiedName;\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n```\n    public class AssetContentReader<T> : ContentTypeReader<Asset<T>>\n    {\n        /// <summary>\n        /// Read the asset from disk\n        /// </summary>\n        /// <param name=\"input\">The content reader we're reading from</param>\n        /// <param name=\"existingInstance\">The asset we're reading from disk</param>\n        /// <returns>A new asset that's copied from disk</returns>\n        protected override Asset<T> Read(ContentReader input, Asset<T> existingInstance)\n        {\n            Asset<T> asset = existingInstance;\n\n            if (asset == null)\n            {\n                asset = new Asset<T>();\n            }\n\n            asset.Name = input.ReadString();\n            asset.Path = input.ReadString();\n\n            //string path = string.Format(@\"{0}s\\{1}\", typeof(T).Name, asset.Name);\n            //asset.AssetContainer = input.ContentManager.Load<T>(path);\n\n            if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(asset.Name))\n            {\n                asset.AssetContainer = input.ContentManager.Load<T>(string.Format(@\"{0}\\{1}\", asset.Path, asset.Name));\n            }\n\n            return asset;\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nI can load most my assets, but these ones aren't working properly (there are some others too, but I'm assuming they suffer from the same problem). They're all XML files in the content directory. I load them doing this:\n\n```\nStoreItems.Load<CoolingSystem<Weapon>>      (@\"Game\\Equipment\\WCS01\");\n```\n\nThere's some background stuff going on here, but it essentially calls the ContentManager Load<T>() method.\n\nYou can skip the next paragraph if you don't care about the backstory.\n\nThat puts me in the ContentManager.cs file (line 177). This all works. There's a call to ReadAsset<T>() on line 209, that all works until it calls ReadAsset<T>() on line 294. This puts me in the ContentReader.cs file on line 69. InitializeTypeReaders() is then called, and on line 83 it calls LoadAssetReaders(). This takes me to ContentTypeReaderManager.cs and line 79.\n\nOk, so on line 130 the reader goes and sees how many readers are in the class. In my case, it's 14. From there until line 202 it loops through a bunch of stuff to figure out which readers it needs. This is all peachy. In my case we only care about contentReaders[1]. It reports back the following type:\n\n```\n{Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content.ReflectiveReader<PewEngine.Modules.Weapons.Weapon>}\n```\n\nOnce it's done looping through, that's where we get to my problem. On line 205 (ContentTypeReaderManager.cs in case you've lost track) it loops through all the readers to see if they need to be initialized. The one we care about does. This calls the Initialize() method on ReflectiveReader.cs. This is where it poops.\n\nFrom what I can tell, this method loops through all the properties of the class passed in (PewEngine.Modules.Weapons.Weapon). The very first one of these is of type List<Projectile>. It then goes and tries to figure out the reader to use for that type (line 52). There's a bunch of code that it does for this, but it eventually ends up at the GetTypeReader() method in ContentTypeReaderManager.cs (line 59).\n\nNotice on line 62 it tries to lookup the correct reader using the original 14 content readers it looped through in the CoolingSystem<T> class. The Asset<Projectile> should be using my custom build reader class. But there is no reader for List<Asset<Projectile>>. in that colletion, so there is no reader to look up. The method returns null, which causes the code to throw an exception in ReflectiveReader.cs (line 148).\n\nAnd that's where I'm stuck. I'm trying to create a sample project that exhibits the same issue, but I haven't been able to reproduce it. I was also thinking of trying to fix the issue, but I'm honestly not sure how to attack the problem. I'm going to keep plugging away at it, but I was hoping maybe someone smarter than me might be able to look at it. If additional information is needed, just let me know.\n\nI'd rather not provide a link for the source of my game for everyone to download, but if someone needs it to troubleshoot I can provide access to it (Visual Studio Online or a ZIP package).\n\nAs a side note, in case it's not obvious, this all works fine with XNA 4.0.\n\n![contenttypereadermanager](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12102130/8884974/b3db5b52-3218-11e5-8265-79b894656509.PNG)\n![reflectivereader](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12102130/8884975/b3db666a-3218-11e5-9301-93b838a3c2dd.PNG)\n\nEdit: I suck at commenting when there's markdown\n\nEdit2: I noticed I forgot about my homebrew Asset<U> class, so I added that above. The class I'm trying to load is declared like this in XML:\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\n<XnaContent>\n  <Asset Type=\"PewEngine.Modules.Equipment.CoolingSystem[PewEngine.Modules.Weapons.Weapon]\">\n    <Name>Weapon Cooling System</Name>\n    <Sprites>\n      <Name>WCSIcon01</Name>\n      <Path>Game\\Sprites\\Icons</Path>\n    </Sprites>\n    <Sound>\n      <Name></Name>\n      <Path></Path>\n    </Sound>\n    <Price>16000</Price>\n    <TechLevel>4</TechLevel>\n    <Description>Helps keep your weapons cool, even during sustained fire.

found a bug that could be related to #3572 #3386 and #1683 but none of those seem to describe the issue the way I'm seeing it. I've managed to reproduce a minimum sample to prove it.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```\npublic class Game1 : Game\n{\n    private GraphicsDeviceManager _graphics;\n    private SpriteBatch _spriteBatch;\n    private Texture2D _texture;\n\n    public Game1()\n    {\n        _graphics = new GraphicsDeviceManager(this);\n        Content.RootDirectory = \"Content\";\n        Window.AllowUserResizing = true;\n    }\n\n    protected override void LoadContent()\n    {\n        _spriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(GraphicsDevice);\n        _texture = Content.Load<Texture2D>(\"hills.png\");\n    }\n\n    protected override void UnloadContent()\n    {\n    }\n\n    protected override void Update(GameTime gameTime)\n    {\n        if (GamePad.GetState(PlayerIndex.One).Buttons.Back == ButtonState.Pressed || Keyboard.GetState().IsKeyDown(Keys.Escape))\n            Exit();\n\n        base.Update(gameTime);\n    }\n\n    protected override void Draw(GameTime gameTime)\n    {\n        GraphicsDevice.Viewport = new Viewport(50, 50, 400, 300);\n        GraphicsDevice.Clear(Color.CornflowerBlue);\n\n        _spriteBatch.Begin();\n        _spriteBatch.Draw(_texture, new Vector2(-200, -200));\n        _spriteBatch.End();\n\n        base.Draw(gameTime);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNothing particularly special going on here. I'm drawing a single large sprite and setting the `Viewport` property as shown in the [MSDN example](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.xna.framework.graphics.graphicsdevice.viewport.aspx)\n\nThe problem is, when referencing the `MonoGame.Framework.WindowsGL` NuGet package I

Whenever audio is played from XACT project build, which has in some sound any attribute set to some non-default value, gets played alright first time in the game, but it also messes up with some other sound files being played onward for some unknown reason (they are either playing for like 10ms OR not playing at all OR are distorted OR are playing till first sound after that one played plays...), not only itself.\n\nMaybe it is tied to sounds and cues placed in XACT project after the one with changed attributes, as files before the one with changed attributes were always playing without any issues... I'll have a look at it some more myself, but I think this should be worked on a little, minimally regarding some backwards compatibility with ported XNA projects, which could be using these XACT features.\n\nEDIT2: Not caused by some secific device... It is doing this also on my WP8.1... \nMain development platform: Windows DX Project\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4014/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4013","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4013/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4013/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4013/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4013","id":95809230,"number":4013,"title":"How to properly cap FPS in Monogame?","user":{"login":"uzyfeo","id":8607981,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8607981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzyfeo","html_url":"https://github.com/uzyfeo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzyfeo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzyfeo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzyfeo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzyfeo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzyfeo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzyfeo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzyfeo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzyfeo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzyfeo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2015-07-18T09:42:13Z","updated_at":"2015-07-23T06:28:15Z","closed_at":"2015-07-21T11:57:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I wanted to cap FPS of my game at 30fps conditionally if being built for Windows Phone, as I don't need it to be running at 60fps on it and I heard from too many it is better to have it capped on mobile device because of battery draining.\n\nI used same snippet of code used by XNA for Windows Phone 7:\n\n```\n//FrameRate is 30fps by default for WindowsPhone.\nTargetElapsedTime = TimeSpan.FromTicks(333333);\n```\n\nBut...
