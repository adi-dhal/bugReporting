With the addition of new platforms and the desire to split MonoGame into multiple assemblies...  project file management will only get worse.\n\nOne solution is to switch to using automatic generation of solution/project files using a build configuration tool.  One of these is called [Premake](http://industriousone.com/premake).\n\n> Describe your software project just once, using Premake's simple \n> and easy to read syntax, and build it everywhere. \n\nPremake is a single EXE with zero dependencies and runs on Windows/Mac/Linux.  \n\nWe would write a premake script that defines what solutions/projects to build and what files are included in them.  We then include a small batch file in the project root that would execute that script whenever we need to regenerate things.\n\nThe big benefit it consistency and no longer needing to hand edit 10+ project files when something changes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1722/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1721","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1721/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1721/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1721/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1721","id":14196470,"number":1721,"title":"Made stencil work on iOS","user":{"login":"Syrco","id":4396544,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4396544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Syrco","html_url":"https://github.com/Syrco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Syrco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Syrco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Syrco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Syrco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Syrco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Syrco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Syrco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Syrco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Syrco/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":12,"created_at":"2013-05-10T15:41:18Z","updated_at":"2014-07-11T02:07:47Z","closed_at":"2013-10-09T23:56:26Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/1721","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1721","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1721.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1721.patch"},"body":"Stencil doesn't work on iOS when rendering directly to screen because its framebuffer is created with no consideration of PreferredDepthStencilFormat.\nA better fix would be to consider that, but I didn't want to start digging in the code, and since the depth buffer is already hard coded, I just added that there.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1720","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1720/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1720/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1720/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1720","id":14184957,"number":1720,"title":"Visual C# 2010 does not copy SDL.dll","user":{"login":"flamedra","id":4395273,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4395273?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flamedra","html_url":"https://github.com/flamedra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flamedra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flamedra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flamedra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flamedra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flamedra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flamedra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flamedra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flamedra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flamedra/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":526188,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/Windows","name":"Windows","color":"f99319","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2013-05-10T09:51:40Z","updated_at":"2016-09-05T00:04:20Z","closed_at":"2015-05-13T09:35:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Whenever I create a new MonoGame Windows OpenGL Project, and then try to run it in debug mode, I get the following error :\n\nError   1   Unable to copy file \"C:\\Users\\Program Files (x86)\\MonoGame\\v3.0\\Assemblies\\WindowsGL\\SDL.dll\" to \"bin\\WindowsGL\\Debug\\SDL.dll\".

changes)\n\nThoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1705/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1704","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1704/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1704/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1704/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1704","id":13925986,"number":1704,"title":"Shader

the course of building the Windows 8 version of the Ship game sample I've hit some issues upgrading the shaders to DX 11 (shader noob fyi)\n\nI followed most the advice out there to change types and functions and the shaders now compile but now they are hitting a \"not implemented\" exception in the GraphicsDevice class (ln 1762), so wondering if there is anything I can do to avoid hitting that.\n\nAnother very odd thing in the conversion, in the Blur.fx file - https://github.com/DDReaper/MonoGame-Samples/blob/samples.ShipGame/ShipGameSample/ShipGameContentContent/shaders/Blur.fx - I was able to convert the texture sampling function to DX 11 format:\n# if SM4\n\n```\n        float4 c = g_ColorMap.Sample(ColorSampler, tc);\n```\n# else\n\n```\n        float4 c = tex2D(ColorSampler, tc);\n```\n# endif\n\nHowever if I tried that in any of the other shaders I get the following error:\nError   1   Unable to compile the effect.\nX3013: 'Sample': intrinsic method does not take 2 parameters    C:\\Development\\MonoGame\\MonoGame-Darkside\\Samples\\ShipGameSample\\ShipGameContentContent\\shaders\\AnimSprite.fx   39  33  ShipGameContent\n\nSo don't know if this is related to the
