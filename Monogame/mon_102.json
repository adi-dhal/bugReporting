We call `Texture2D.GetData` only on loading a sprite sheet, and only to extract metadata embedded in the pixel data of a png file.  Here is an example of what we're doing:\n\n```\nint dataWidth, dataHeight, dataX, dataY;\nTexture2D source;\n// variables are set between declaration and call to GetData\n// dataX < dataWidth <= source.Width\n// dataY < dataHeight <= source.Height\n// source always contains a valid image\n\nvar colors = new Color[dataWidth * dataHeight];\n// fails on the following line with IndexOutOfRangeException:\nsource.GetData(0, new Rectangle(dataX, dataY, dataWidth, dataHeight), colors, 0, dataWidth * dataHeight);\n```\n\nOn DirectX (and presumably Android), the call to `GetData` succeeds with the expected data.  Using GL (the `#else` condition in the source code), I consistently get `IndexOutOfRangeException` on larger sprite sheets (in excess of 800x800).\n\nI managed to get it working by changing Graphics/Texture2D.cs in `Texture2D.GetData<T>(int, Rectangle?, T[], int, int)`:\n\n```\n   var temp = new T[this.width*this.height];\n   GL.GetTexImage(TextureTarget.Texture2D, level, this.glFormat, this.glType, temp);\n-  int z = 0, w = 0;\n+  int z = 0, w;\n\n   for(int y= rect.Value.Y; y < rect.Value.Y+ rect.Value.Height; y++) {\n+      w = 0;\n       for(int x=rect.Value.X; x < rect.Value.X + rect.Value.Width; x++) {\n           data[z*rect.Value.Width+w] = temp[(y*width)+x];\n           w++;\n       }\n       z++;\n   }\n```\n\nIs the absence of `w = 0` in the outer `for` loop intentional?  I'm a bit confused.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2957","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2957/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2957/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2957/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2957","id":41227159,"number":2957,"title":"SpriteBatch
