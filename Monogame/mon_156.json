are working on unifying WP8 with the other platforms of MonoGame. The straightforward solution is to have a device orientation and a desired orientation and if they don't match, we apply a rotation to our game. This is working fine, but we have noticed that the DisplayOrientation is implemented in a confusing and hard to use way.\n\nLet's take a look at the MonoGame code of DisplayOrientation:\n\n``` C#\n    [Flags]\n    public enum DisplayOrientation\n    {\n        /// <summary>\n        /// In Xna, this value is Default = 0. The effect of setting\n        /// GraphicsDeviceManager.SupportedOrientations = Default is the same as setting\n        /// GraphicsDeviceManager.SupportedOrientations = LandscapeLeft | LandscapeRight.\n        /// </summary>\n        Default = 1,\n        LandscapeLeft = 2,\n        LandscapeRight = 4,\n        Portrait = 8,\n        // iPhone specific Orientations\n        FaceDown = 16,\n        FaceUp = 32,\n        // Android can also use this orientation\n        PortraitUpsideDown = 64,\n        Unknown = 128,\n    }\n```\n\nThe same in XNA (Click go to definition):\n\n``` C#\n    [Flags]\n    public enum DisplayOrientation\n    {\n        Default = 0,\n        LandscapeLeft = 1,\n        LandscapeRight = 2,\n        Portrait = 4\n    }\n```\n\nI have spent plenty of time working with iOS orientations (implementing iOS 6 orientation model for example). FaceDown and FaceUp are never used. As for PortraitUpsideDown I would recommend renaming it to PortraitDown (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/windowsphone/develop/microsoft.phone.controls.pageorientation%28v=vs.105%29.aspx).\n## My recommendation for DisplayOrientation\n\n``` C#\n    [Flags]\n    public enum DisplayOrientation\n    {\n        Default = 0,\n        LandscapeLeft = 1,\n        LandscapeRight = 2,\n        Portrait = 4,\n        PortraitDown = 8,\n        Unknown = 16\n    }\n```\n\nDefault can mean LandscapeLeft | LandscapeRight or Portrait depending on the requested resolution (the comment in MonoGame is wrong), so it should stay 0.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Any input is welcome.\n\nFurther reading:\nhttp://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnhar/archive/2010/07/12/orientation-and-rotation-on-windows-phone.aspx\n\nOrientations need some additional work on WP8, as it isn't implemented at the moment.\n## My recommendation for WP8\n\nGraphicsDevice.PresentationParameters.DisplayOrientation should be set to Portrait, as the swap chain is always in portrait.\n\nThe GamePage.xaml should have all orientations enabled (Portrait+LandscapeLeft+LandscapeRight). The XAML should notify the WPGameWindow every time the device orientation changes (display orientation remains portrait!). If the new orientation is part of SupportedOrientations, we set the CurrentOrientation to our new rotation and notify the game if needed.\n\nThis way, the game will see what orientation it should be in and what orientation the GraphicsDevice has.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1335","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1335/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1335/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1335/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1335","id":10804199,"number":1335,"title":"Fixed

The straightforward solution is to have a device orientation and a desired orientation and if they don't match, we apply a rotation to our game. This is working fine (and the only big bug left in WP8 is RenderTarget), but we have noticed that the DisplayOrientation is implemented in a confusing and hard to use way.\n\nLet's take a look at the MonoGame code of DisplayOrientation:\n\n``` C#\n    [Flags]\n    public enum DisplayOrientation\n    {\n        /// <summary>\n        /// In Xna, this value is Default = 0. The effect of setting\n        /// GraphicsDeviceManager.SupportedOrientations = Default is the same as setting\n        /// GraphicsDeviceManager.SupportedOrientations = LandscapeLeft | LandscapeRight.\n        /// </summary>\n        Default = 1,\n        LandscapeLeft = 2,\n        LandscapeRight = 4,\n        Portrait = 8,\n        // iPhone specific Orientations\n        FaceDown = 16,\n        FaceUp = 32,\n        // Android can also use this orientation\n        PortraitUpsideDown = 64,\n        Unknown = 128,\n    }\n```\n\nThe same in XNA (Click go to definition):\n\n``` C#\n    [Flags]\n    public enum DisplayOrientation\n    {\n        Default = 0,\n        LandscapeLeft = 1,\n        LandscapeRight = 2,\n        Portrait = 4,\n    }\n```\n\nI have spent plenty of time working with iOS orientations (implementing iOS 6 orientation model for example). FaceDown and FaceUp are never used. As for PortraitUpsideDown I would recommend renaming it to PortraitDown (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/windowsphone/develop/microsoft.phone.controls.pageorientation%28v=vs.105%29.aspx).\n## My recommendation\n\n``` C#\n    [Flags]\n    public enum DisplayOrientation\n    {\n        Default = 0,\n        LandscapeLeft = 1,\n        LandscapeRight = 2,\n        Portrait = 4,\n        PortraitDown = 8,\n        Unknown = 16\n    }\n```\n\nDefault can mean LandscapeLeft | LandscapeRight or Portrait depending on the requested resolution (the comment in MonoGame is wrong), so it should stay 0.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Any input is welcome.\n\nFurther reading:\nhttp://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnhar/archive/2010/07/12/orientation-and-rotation-on-windows-phone.aspx\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1324/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1323","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1323/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1323/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1323/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1323","id":10795768,"number":1323,"title":"Detach from MonoSpider","user":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":27759082,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/Maintenance","name":"Maintenance","color":"000000","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2013-02-08T21:12:10Z","updated_at":"2013-02-10T09:21:17Z","closed_at":"2013-02-10T09:21:17Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"It is confusing and kinda crappy that mono/MonoGame is forked from monospider/monogame.\n\nmonospider/monogame was one of the two repos (the other was kangaroo/monogame) used in the transition of MonoGame from Codeplex to being hosted here on GitHub.\n\nIf we can have the owner of that repo delete it then MonoGame will become the new root of that network.

I left it this way for now because I was unsure of how we'd select the compression  for the font. Will it be via a property similar to how the Texture2DProcessor works? Either way, since Compression is already implemented, this is a rather quick fix.\n\nAt the moment, using generics in the pipeline was not working. Long story short, we are doing a dictionary lookup for readers and writers, but at runtime we can't use this lookup against an instance of this generic type. As far as the dictionary lookup is concerned, List<T> and List<Rectangle> aren't the same thing.
