It is a very rare issue, most of the time the game is OK. Hovewer sometimes these textures get very messed. Even some SpriteFonts are shown instead of some textures sometimes.\n\n![bug1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2102344/3299951/be4d2bdc-f61a-11e3-9237-c09b512cb251.png)\n\nI use current MonoGame, the main branch develop. Some older version of the MonoGame (from May 2013) had the same problem.\n\nI can reproduce this error on my Nexus 5 (Android 4.4) and Nokia X (AOSP 4.1.2), but I do not see this error on a Samsung Galaxy S3 (Android 4.3).\n\n![bug2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2102344/3299953/ca50e39c-f61a-11e3-9b65-7d23300f3d77.png)\n\nThese textures get messed when I **lock and unlock the screen** during the game (approximately in 70% cases everything is OK after that, otherwise at least one texture is missing or broken). \n\nWhen I **switch** from my game **to another app and switch back**, everything is OK! Textures are loaded correctly and the problem is no longer here.\n\nI use approximately 270 different textures in the game (but only some of them are loaded at one moment), = approximately 1.67 MB in PNG files. I load texture directly via TitleContainer.OpenStream().\n\n.\n\nLOG for lock / unlock the screen:\n\n```\n06-16 19:26:21.973 I/MonoGame(18332): android.intent.action.SCREEN_OFF\n\n06-16 19:26:53.465 I/MonoGame(18332): android.intent.action.SCREEN_ON\n06-16 19:26:54.995 I/MonoGame(18332): android.intent.action.USER_PRESENT\n```\n\nLOG for switching to another app and back:\n\n```\n06-16 19:28:10.605 D/MonoGame(18332): MonoGameAndroidGameView.DestroyFrameBuffer\n06-16 19:28:10.625 D/MonoGame(18332): MonoGameAndroidGameView.SurfaceDestroyed\n\n06-16 19:28:44.395 D/MonoGame(18332): MonoGameAndroidGameView.CreateFrameBuffer\n06-16 19:28:44.395 D/MonoGame(18332): Creating Color:Default Depth:24 Stencil:0\n06-16 19:28:44.405 D/MonoGame(18332): Created format Index: 489689698, Color: 32 (8888), Depth: 24, Stencil: 8, Samples: 0, Accum: 32 (8888), Buffers: 0, Stereo: False\n06-16 19:28:44.405 D/MonoGame(18332): Framebuffer Status: FramebufferComplete\n06-16 19:28:44.405 D/MonoGame(18332): MonoGameAndroidGameView.SurfaceCreated: surfaceFrame = Rect(0, 0 - 1080, 1776)\n```\n\n.\nAs you can see from the log, when I switch to another app, methods DestroyFrameBuffer and CreateFrameBuffer are called, as well as SurfaceDestroyed and SurfaceCreated. Hovewer when I just lock the screen and unlock it, none of these method is called...\n\nI think it could be the problem. Can methods DestroyFrameBuffer and CreateFrameBuffer be called even on lock / unlock? How can I call them? How can I clear these graphical buffers?\n\n.\n**More info:** It seems that this problem does not depend on free memory in the phone. Even when I perform a clean install of the app and a phone reboot, and all other apps are closed, this problem persists. It does not depend also on how long the phone has been in a sleep mode; even very fast lock/unlock of the screen can cause this error.\n\nI hope you can help me with it :)\n\nSimilar issues: https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/issues/993 https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/issues/2427\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2718","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2718/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2718/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2718/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2718","id":35852585,"number":2718,"title":"Added image attaching for iOS Guide's Twitter","user":{"login":"picobots","id":2413048,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2413048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots","html_url":"https://github.com/picobots","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/picobots/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2014-06-17T02:06:28Z","updated_at":"2014-06-17T14:17:05Z","closed_at":"2014-06-17T07:34:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/2718","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2718","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2718.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2718.patch"},"body":"Added the ability to attach images to tweets in the iOS Guide Twitter method\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2717","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2717/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2717/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2717/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2717","id":35821020,"number":2717,"title":"Memory leak in Windows Desktop Projects","user":{"login":"ChrisSippel","id":6963296,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6963296?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSippel","html_url":"https://github.com/ChrisSippel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSippel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSippel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSippel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSippel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSippel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSippel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSippel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSippel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSippel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":30,"created_at":"2014-06-16T18:05:33Z","updated_at":"2017-04-30T01:33:15Z","closed_at":"2017-04-30T01:33:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"First I would like to say I love the new version of MonoGame!\n\nI believe I have found a memory leak in the Windows Desktop projects of MonoGame.\n\nIf I create just a blank Windows OpenGL project and just let it run it seems to consume ~4 to ~100 KB of memory every second or so regardless of activity on the screen.\n\nIf I create just a blank Windows DirectX project and just let it run, it on occasion consumes ~4 to ~8 KB of memory, but not very often.

This means reading the content does as little work possible which is a huge win on games that have lots of reflective types.\n\nAlso ran across a fix for `EnumWriter<T>` which I included here.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2705/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2704","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2704/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2704/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2704/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2704","id":35452525,"number":2704,"title":"TypeConverters in Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Design namespace","user":{"login":"flibitijibibo","id":1396814,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1396814?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo","html_url":"https://github.com/flibitijibibo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-06-11T05:23:57Z","updated_at":"2014-06-13T08:39:32Z","closed_at":"2014-06-13T08:39:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So I noticed a few new files like this one in the recent commits...\n\nhttps://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework.Content.Pipeline/Vector2TypeConverter.cs\n\n... which I found interesting, because I have something just like it in the main assembly:\n\nhttps://github.com/flibitijibibo/MonoGame/blob/monogame-sdl2/MonoGame.Framework/Vector2.cs#L662\n\nLooking at MSDN, turns out there's a whole namespace called Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Design that covers for all these TypeConverters:\n\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.xna.framework.design.aspx\n\nIt looks like we ended up making two separate TypeConverters that are actually public in the spec!
