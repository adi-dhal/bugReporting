Forums suggest that it is because you need Windows Phone SDK 7.1.  After an entire day of hunting the cause, I was able to isolate the problem down to 2MGFX.  In MojoShader.cs the crash happens on every single Struct that has the explicit layout attribute.  Basically none of the unions are loading.  I replaced them all with Sequential lay outs and took out the unions, and everything works.  I am able to load and process content w just standard XNA 4.0 Refresh installed.  \n\nI suspect that the 7.1 sdk is working by co-incidence since it the alignment must change.  Or the 7.1 ContentProcessor doesn't load every class type, or perhaps it uses meta data to determine which types need to be loaded and ignoring the rest...\n\nIf you wish to test it yourself, try loading the Monogame Content Processor DLL from a normal app ( A standard WPF app / Win forms)\n\n``` C#\nAssembly a = null;\ntry\n{\n  a = Assembly.LoadFile(@\"MonoGame\\MonoGame.ContentPipeline\\ContentProcessors\\bin\\Debug\\MonoGameContentProcessors.dll\");\n}\n```\n\nJust loading the DLL works fine...\nHowever as soon as you try to load the types ( which is what XNA will do to try to find all the types that are [ContentProcessors]:\n\n``` c#\nType[] t = a.GetTypes();\n```\n\nThat will throw an exception:\n\n``` c#\nif (ex is System.Reflection.ReflectionTypeLoadException)\n{\n   var typeLoadException = ex as ReflectionTypeLoadException;\n   var loaderExceptions = typeLoadException.LoaderExceptions;\n}\n```\n\nThe error appears on every struct that has a union as:\nSystem.TypeLoadException: Could not load type 'MOJOSHADER_astDataType' from assembly 'Pipeline, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null' because it contains an object field at offset 0 that is incorrectly aligned or overlapped by a non-object field. \n(I am only listing one, as the others are all the same just different names)\n\nI'm not very good with explicit struct layouts, so I'm not sure how to fix the problem, perhaps someone here knows?  Obviously removing them worked just fine since I'm in the DirectX build so I don't actually need MojoShader.\n\nI am mildly concerned though, as http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/66243/Marshaling-with-C-Chapter-3-Marshaling-Compound-Ty\nmentions:\n\nAs a result, we cannot union both members of our example, because whether marshaling the second variable charArray as an array, a System.String, or as a System.Text.StringBuilder, it is still a reference-type. Therefore, we have to leave the benefits of unions and marshal only a single member. For our example, we will create two marshaling types for our union, one with the first member marshaled, and the other with the other member.\n\nChanging the public string types to IntPtrs works for loading, but it will require marshaling the string manually.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1845/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1844","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1844/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1844/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1844/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1844","id":16438391,"number":1844,"title":"Loading Shaders w/o Exec","user":{"login":"nightst4r","id":10628,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r","html_url":"https://github.com/nightst4r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nightst4r/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-07-07T03:04:22Z","updated_at":"2014-05-10T05:12:10Z","closed_at":"2014-05-10T05:12:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is there any chance of getting a version of the TwoMGFX functions that operate in memory rather than having to work with files?

Audio data is needlessly held on to after it has been given to OpenAL.**_\n\nYou will notice that we remove byte[] arrays in OALSoundBuffer and SoundEffectInstance in this patch. The code in those files implies that we need the data for purposes other than loading directly into OpenAL, but no code in MonoGame currently uses this. So, we essentially keep a duplicate copy of _every single OpenAL buffer_ for the duration of the program's runtime unless we explicitly destroy the data ourselves.\n\nBy simply removing these from the files, we improve memory use drastically, and for XACT, we improve it _by at least 50%_.\n\n**_2. Redundant decoding/rewriting of wavedata is performed presumably to reuse the public API.**_\n\nWhile it makes sense on paper, the fact is we're decoding header data only to reencode it when we're \"done\" in a single method multiple times for every single audio file that gets loaded into MonoGame. This can possibly introduce memory problems like those found in bullet one, and it's also a pretty goofy waste of resources when we can just send the data to internal methods that will eventually give it to OpenAL.\n\nBy fixing these two issues, performance for XACT/SoundEffects on OpenAL has improved immensely (mostly in regard to memory use, CPU use certainly improves but is not noticeable on high-end machines).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1841/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1840","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1840/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1840/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1840/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1840","id":16430792,"number":1840,"title":"WP8 MediaPlayer 3100 error","user":{"login":"dekroll","id":4506967,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4506967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekroll","html_url":"https://github.com/dekroll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekroll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekroll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekroll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekroll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekroll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekroll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekroll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekroll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dekroll/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2013-07-06T13:23:25Z","updated_at":"2013-07-18T18:08:24Z","closed_at":"2013-07-18T18:08:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi! \n\nI have a problem with MediaPlayer. \nI use sources from developer branch (SDX binaries were taken from MonoGame dependencies on GitHub). \nWhen I call Play(Song) method, nothing happens.\n\nI've modified source code of MediaPlayer and attached MediaFailed handler. \nIt is always reports about 3100 error. \nHere are some extra details:\n   3100 An error has occurred.\n\n   ErrorTrace = Silverlight/4.1.60221.0\nTested on: Lumia 520, 920, Emulator with WMA and MP3. \nResources were taken from WP7 application. \n\n Could you please help me to fix that issue?

I want to make a game that uses [Cairo](http://cairographics.org/) to draw some vectory goodness, but I'd like to use MonoGame as a framework because of how easy it makes the game loop and input functionality and stuff. Plus it can work cross-platform, sorta! So yeah, I'd like to not only make a game with Cairo and MonoGame, but also a framework to make other games like this. I'm a programmer and not an artist, so the idea of just drawing 2D stuff with math appeals to me.\n\n[The problem I'm running up against](https://github.com/adamrezich/arena/blob/master/VGame/VGame.cs) is that it's just too darn slow to do what I'm doing, which is:\n- Draw the scene with Cairo through a Cairo.Context to a Cairo.Surface every frame\n- Copy the data from the Cairo.Surface to a Texture2D using SetData()\n- Draw the Texture2D using SpriteBatch\n\nEvery single frame.\n\nThis is hecka slow, as it turns out! I've looked everywhere I can, but I can't seem to find any way of directly accessing the screen buffer and writing pixel data to it using MonoGame or XNA. Is there any chance at all that there could end up being a way of directly accessing the pixel buffer data to more easily facilitate this? I know it's kind of a niche issue, but hey, it never hurts to ask, right?\n\nI see that XNA provides [GraphicsDevice.GetBackBufferData](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.xna.framework.graphics.graphicsdevice.getbackbufferdata.aspx)... is there any chance that this data could just be exposed and directly read from/written to?\n\nI eventually also found [this](https://github.com/kevingadd/Fracture/blob/master/Squared/RenderLib/Evil.cs) (from [this article](http://www.altdevblogaday.com/2011/10/02/copying-pixels-from-a-pointer-to-an-xna-texture2d/), which a.)

I re-re-re-re-re-rechecked the references, removed, re-added the correct one, and when I run it, always the same thing, null ref in the MonoGame WindowsPhone assembly.\n\nThen I found out that as much as I had chose the WindowsGL assembly, after I hit the OK button it would reference the WindowsPhone one. I went to see the .csproj content and it hit me, the reference didn't had the path to the assembly, it was only referencing by the name and since there were at least 4 references with the same name, the first one was being picked or something like that. You can see the references in [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/vvolkgang/5924941). The first one is the reference I had and the second one is the default reference of the project template.\n\nThat being said, I believe that the problem appears if you add the reference in Visual Studio. I really don't know what can be done to fix this apart from issuing a documentation warning just in case.\n\nI'm using Visual Studio 2012 and MonoGame 3.0.1 Stable.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1834/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1833","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1833/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1833/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1833/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1833","id":16311736,"number":1833,"title":"Added an overload to SpriteBatch.Draw()","user":{"login":"cmark89","id":2620362,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2620362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmark89","html_url":"https://github.com/cmark89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmark89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmark89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmark89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmark89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmark89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmark89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmark89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmark89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmark89/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":22,"created_at":"2013-07-03T10:45:14Z","updated_at":"2014-06-29T07:32:59Z","closed_at":"2013-07-08T14:03:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/1833","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1833","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1833.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1833.patch"},"body":"While it's a small change, I've added a new overload to SpriteBatch.Draw() that wraps the two \"large\" Draw methods and makes all arguments following the Texture2D optional.  The intention is to simplify the process of invoking SpriteBatch.Draw() by allowing the user to call the method using named parameters instead of feeding in a long list of what are essentially default or null values in order to change a single property. \n\nThis allows verbose draw calls such as:\n\n``` csharp\nspriteBatch.Draw(texture, playerRectangle, null, Color.White, 0f, Vector2.Zero, SpriteEffects.FlipHorizontally, 0f);\n```\n\nTo be written more concisely and clearly:\n\n``` csharp\nspriteBatch.Draw(texture, drawRectangle: playerRectangle, effect: SpriteEffects.FlipHorizontally);\n```\n\nAnother example, simply changing the rotation of a drawn sprite:\n\n``` csharp\nspriteBatch.Draw(texture, position: playerPosition, rotation: playRotation);\n```\n\nYou can see where this is going.  I added this because I've always hated having to fill extraneous parameters in XNA just to add a rotation to a texture, for example.  Feedback appreciated.  \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1833/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1832","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1832/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1832/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1832/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1832","id":16295382,"number":1832,"title":"Multi window touch input","user":{"login":"RayBatts","id":1228707,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1228707?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts","html_url":"https://github.com/RayBatts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayBatts/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":47,"created_at":"2013-07-03T00:08:50Z","updated_at":"2014-06-27T08:56:05Z","closed_at":"2014-02-21T01:59:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/1832","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1832","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1832.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1832.patch"},"body":"This PR contains the touch input changes discussed here: https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/issues/1731\n\nThe \"state\" information from TouchPanel has been moved into a TouchPanelState class.
