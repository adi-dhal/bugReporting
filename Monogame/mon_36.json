now it is not possible to modify default bound state, i.e. if you do\n`GraphicsDevice.BlendState.BlendFactor = Color.Red`\nit'll throw an exception (\"You cannot modify the blend state after it has been bound to the graphics device!\").\nSo if you want to modify only blend factor(keeping other blend state parameters), you have to do following:\n\n```\nvar state = GraphicsDevice.BlendState.Clone();\nstate.BlendFactor = Color.Red;\nGraphicsDevice.BlendState = state;\n```\n\nProbably more correct approach is to mark the bound blend state(or any other state such as RasterizerState) as dirty on any parameter change and then reapply it before next render call.\n\nI.e. solution that will allow changing BlendFactor of bound state would involve following steps:\n1. Add method invalidating blend state to GraphicsDevice:\n   \n   ```\n   internal void InvalidateBlendState()\n   {\n       _blendStateDirty = true;\n   }\n   ```\n2. Make sure BlendState.GraphicsDevice is set when the state is bound.\n3. Call InvalidateBlendState when BlendFactor is changed:\n   \n   ```\n   public Color BlendFactor\n   {\n     get { return _blendFactor; }\n         set\n         {\n           if (value == _blendFactor) {\n             return;\n           }\n   \n           _blendFactor = value;\n           GraphicsDevice.InvalidateBlendState();\n         }\n   }\n   ```\n\n**P.S. Thanks for your work! MonoGame is great not only because it is game engine, but also because it is unique source of experience of how to operate the gaming hardware on C#.**\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4915/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4914","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4914/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4914/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4914/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4914","id":159403894,"number":4914,"title":"Fix typo in SDL GL bindings","user":{"login":"WardBenjamin","id":4739008,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4739008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WardBenjamin","html_url":"https://github.com/WardBenjamin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WardBenjamin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WardBenjamin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WardBenjamin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WardBenjamin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WardBenjamin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WardBenjamin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WardBenjamin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WardBenjamin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WardBenjamin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-06-09T13:10:05Z","updated_at":"2016-06-09T13:24:57Z","closed_at":"2016-06-09T13:23:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/4914","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4914","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4914.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4914.patch"},"body":"@dellis1972 I think I can safely blame you for this one XD\n\nThis PR has nothing functional, just fixes a typo.

@endimilojkoski findings, I can confirm that DesktopGL crashes if more than one gamepads are plugged.\n\nThe crash happens here: https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/Input/Joystick.SDL.cs#L17\n\nSDL events seem to return the same DeviceID (always 0) for all gamepads plugged, hence the `Joystick.SDL.Joysticks` and  `GamePad.SDL.Gamepads` dictionaries are already populated with the same key-value pair.\n\ncc @cra0zy (I'll try to take a look at this today if I have some time, I
