GamePlatform have all been disposed, the GL context that made the shaders is no longer available, so those GL calls will either produce a silent error or possibly segfault. In the case of OpenTK GL, the entry points from GetProcAddress are still assigned, so it does still call the GL, but it doesn't seem to segfault... somehow. Tools like vogl will catch this, though.\n\nI wasn't sure how the above commit affected other graphics backends, but this could be a possible issue for the OpenGL platforms (particularly the ones with more sensitive drivers). I also don't know if this is the best place to put it, but it does at least get everything before the GL context is gone.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2805/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2804","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2804/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2804/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2804/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2804","id":37733587,"number":2804,"title":"Moved namespace docs to a single file.","user":{"login":"dneelyep","id":947621,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/947621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dneelyep","html_url":"https://github.com/dneelyep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dneelyep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dneelyep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dneelyep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dneelyep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dneelyep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dneelyep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dneelyep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dneelyep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dneelyep/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-07-13T03:11:05Z","updated_at":"2014-07-13T03:45:13Z","closed_at":"2014-07-13T03:45:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/2804","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2804","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2804.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2804.patch"},"body":"As suggested in PR 2802 (https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/pull/2802), moved namespace documentation into its own file.

I'm leaving this here for coherency.\n\nNot sure if this has been discussed before and I can't really find much on google on this topic. If you disconnect from a power source and have the default \"power saver\" plan enabled on Windows 7, ApplicationIdle fires much much slower (around 30 times a second). \n\nI found this out by using the latest MoneGame source and timing the actual fire rate on Application Idle event. All of this is fine and makes sense, but what is really counter intuitive is that if you turn off Fixed FPS you go from 60FPS to 30FPS since Fixed FPS calls update multiple times enforcing the 60FPS.\n\nI wanted to put this here in case someone else wonders why they get a huge frame rate drop after turning off Fixed FPS and possibly start a discussion if this is OK by design since I'm not sure how XNA runs it's game loop. While I understand 99% of the games out there are just fine with Fixed FPS on, it drove me nuts knowing that the frame rate was cut in half when disabling it and I had to figure out why.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2803/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2802","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2802/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2802/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2802/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2802","id":37727469,"number":2802,"title":"Several

the content pipeline has to be built to support specific platforms.  For instance the content pipeline has to know how to do DXT and PVRTC compression.  In this case that is ok as these are public formats on open platforms.\n\nThe problem comes in when we have to deal with platforms like PlayStation4 or XBox One where there will be closed source formats that cannot be built into the existing content pipeline.\n\nCurrently our solution is sort of lame.  We have a \"special\" build for these platforms that has the private bits needed for close platforms.  This then requires us to have multiple content pipelines installed on the same system and we have to select the right one based on the target platform.  This is a mess.\n\nInstead we should develop a simple API internal to the content pipeline assembly that abstracts these platform details.  For instance if you just consider texture compression:\n\n```\ninterface ITextureCompressor\n{\n  void CompressTexture( GraphicsProfile profile,\n                       TextureContent content, \n                       ContentProcessorContext context, \n                       bool generateMipmaps, \n                       bool premultipliedAlpha);\n}\n```\n\nAt startup the pipeline would load all the `Pipeline.Plugin.XXXX.dll` found in the pipeline install path.  Then using attributes we would find the correct `ITextureCompressor` for a particular target platform.\n\nThis same technique will be used for other cases like sound effect conversion, song conversion, video conversion, etc.\n\nThis sort of design allows us to easily extend an existing MonoGame content pipeline install with platform specific formats.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2780","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2780/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2780/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2780/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2780","id":37200971,"number":2780,"title":"MediaPlayer.Volume affects all sounds","user":{"login":"braddabug","id":6439564,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6439564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/braddabug","html_url":"https://github.com/braddabug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braddabug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braddabug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braddabug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braddabug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braddabug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braddabug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braddabug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braddabug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braddabug/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2014-07-05T15:41:00Z","updated_at":"2015-04-26T19:18:53Z","closed_at":"2015-04-26T19:18:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It seems like whenever I try to use MediaPlayer.Volume to change the volume of a background song it affects all sounds (sounds playing via SoundEffect).
