This technically means the pitch of the data being set is 1 byte... much less than the actual length of the source data.  On all our previous DirectX platforms... desktop, Windows Phone, Windows 8, and Windows 10 UWP on desktops and even Raspberry Pi 2...  this was allowed and things worked correctly.\n\nOn the new XB1 platform setting 1 for `SrcRowPitch` results in the `UpdateSubresource` call to silently fail to copy the data to the buffer.\n\nThis is our bug technically, but it is a difference in the implementation of DX in a UWP app on XB1.\n\nThanks to @walbourn for suggesting the change which lead me to spot this bug.\n\nFixes https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/issues/4829\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4955/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4954","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4954/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4954/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4954/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4954","id":161154272,"number":4954,"title":"SDL Controller DB update","user":{"login":"mrhelmut","id":3427451,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3427451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut","html_url":"https://github.com/mrhelmut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-06-20T09:34:35Z","updated_at":"2016-06-20T16:57:40Z","closed_at":"2016-06-20T16:57:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/4954","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4954","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4954.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4954.patch"},"body":"This is an update to the SDL controllers database to support more gamepads.
