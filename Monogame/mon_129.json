How Microsoft describe the field is rather vague. Monogame is certainly upholding the letter of their wording on this page<sup>[1](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.xna.framework.gametime.isrunningslowly.aspx)</sup>, but the field is all but useless in it's current implementation. The page on TargetElapsedTime<sup>[2](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.xna.framework.game.targetelapsedtime.aspx)</sup> describes IsRunningSlowly slightly differently and makes it much more useful.\n\nCurrently if the (_accumulatedElapsedTime > TargetElapsedTime) check is true, it will claim the game is running slow. If we have a TargetElapsedTime of 0.1 seconds, and 0.100001 have passed, it claims we are running slow, while if 0.99999 seconds have elapsed we don't get an update() at all (we loop around RetryTick: till we do). Therefore the game is only running not-slow if (_accumulatedElapsedTime == TargetElapsedTime), which because of the variability in sleeping is almost never the case.\n\nI propose that IsRunningSlowly is set to be true if we are doing more than 1 update per draw. Easiest way I can see is to make the current test (_accumulatedElapsedTime > (TargetElapsedTime + TargetElapsedTime), but there's probably a better wizard out there who can find a better solution than that.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2138/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2137","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2137/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2137/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2137/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2137","id":23170265,"number":2137,"title":"Byte4

looking into performance issues in the JSIL MonoGame port, I noticed that SpriteBatcher is doing a lot of extra work for no obvious reason, and it's using DrawUserIndexedPrimitives to flush each batch instead of filling a single index/vertex buffer pair. Filling a single pair would mean that all the queued up drawing operations could be uploaded in one go instead of being uploaded in tiny chunks. For the browser this is really important because the cost of each OpenGL call is _dramatically_ increased due to WebGL's architecture, and a single DrawUserIndexedPrimitives call involves lots of OpenGL calls.\n\nIt seems to me like SpriteBatch could fill the actual index/vertex buffers (as arrays) in one go sequentially after it sorts the SpriteBatchItems, upload the full buffers, then render chunks of those buffers when it needs to flush batches. That would cut down on OpenGL calls considerably and I think it'd probably be faster in desktop OpenGL/Direct3D setups as well. Thoughts?\n\n(mumble grumble spritebatch's design is SO bad for performance)\n\nEDIT: For reference, the Platformer2D example seems to be drawing _six vertices at a time_, each draw operation involving the following high cost operations:\n\nApplying all the rendering states (even worse, each DrawUserIndexedPrimitives flags the ib/vb as dirty, so each call to ApplyState is _forced_ to do work here)\nPinning the index/vertex buffers as GCHandles\nApplying the current vertex declaration\nFilling a temporary index buffer with provided indices\nFilling a temporary vertex buffer with provided vertices\nCalling vertexAttribPointer repeatedly to set up all the attribute streams\n\nEDIT 2: This is no doubt responsible for some miserable performance on PSM as well. If memory serves, PSM does not like it when you do dozens to hundreds of uploads per frame, and state changes were more expensive there too.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2127","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2127/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2127/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2127/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2127","id":22482695,"number":2127,"title":"Depth to texture","user":{"login":"Vodacek","id":2104849,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2104849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vodacek","html_url":"https://github.com/Vodacek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vodacek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vodacek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vodacek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vodacek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vodacek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vodacek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vodacek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vodacek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vodacek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2013-11-11T22:36:03Z","updated_at":"2014-06-30T10:12:33Z","closed_at":"2014-04-26T22:53:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/2127","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2127","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2127.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2127.patch"},"body":"This pull introduces saving depth to texture in render targets for OpenGL.
