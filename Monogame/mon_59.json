Processing a model with MonoGame's pipeline and then drawing it using model.Draw() causes it to be drawn entirely black. However, if you process the model with XNA's pipeline and then load and Draw() the xnb in MonoGame it displays as expected. See these threads for more information on the problem:\n\nhttps://github.com/mono/MonoGame/issues/4069\nhttp://community.monogame.net/t/3d-models-appear-black/2596\nhttp://community.monogame.net/t/problem-with-3d-objects-textures/2474\nhttp://community.monogame.net/t/diagnosing-rendering-issues-for-3d-model-in-new-content-pipeline/1432\n\nThe problem occurs here:\n\nhttps://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework.Content.Pipeline/OpenAssetImporter.cs#L320\n\nThe pipeline checks if Assimp has imported a particular lighting property from the model's material, and if so, sets the relevant nullable property in a BasicMaterialContent object. If the particular lighting property is not found then the relevant BasicMaterialContent property remains null. When the BasicMaterialContent is serialized it uses GetValueOrDefault() which sets all the unfound lighting properties to the default float value of 0. Thus the resulting xnb model has Alpha and SpecularPower set to 0 causing it to be drawn entirely black:\n\nhttps://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework.Content.Pipeline/Serialization/Compiler/BasicEffectWriter.cs\n\nAssimp .NET seems to provide sensible defaults when getting a lighting property for which no corresponding property was found in the model's material:\n\nhttps://github.com/assimp/assimp-net/blob/master/AssimpNet/Material.cs#L253\n\nSo this patch changes the pipeline to always accept the value provided by Assimp .NET, which will be either the property from the model or the default value provided. This solves the black rendering problem on the handful of models I have tried (on Windows 10) but I don't know if it is a correct or appropriate fix.\n\nAs a final note here are the final lighting values from importing a simple untextured model in various ways (unlisted properties do not differ between the three methods).\n## XNA Pipeline\n\nAlpha = 1\nDiffuseColor = 1 1 1\nSpecularColor = 1 1 1\nSpecularPower = 16\n## Current MonoGame Pipeline\n\nAlpha = 0\nDiffuseColor = 0.8 0.8 0.8\nSpecularColor = 0 0 0\nSpecularPower = 0\n## Patched MonoGame Pipeline\n\nAlpha = 1\nDiffuseColor = 0.8 0.8 0.8\nSpecularColor = 0 0 0\nSpecularPower = 1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4243","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4243/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4243/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4243/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4243","id":116949243,"number":4243,"title":"[Pipeline Tool] Use system gtk-sharp 3","user":{"login":"cra0zy","id":6773302,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6773302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy","html_url":"https://github.com/cra0zy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-11-14T19:58:25Z","updated_at":"2015-11-21T21:04:50Z","closed_at":"2015-11-21T20:45:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/4243","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4243","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4243.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4243.patch"},"body":"Stuff done:\n- added LocalCopy argument to protobuild and disabled copying of gtk-sharp3 dll files, this forces system gtk-sharp3 libraries to be used instead\n- disabled copying of gtk-sharp3 config files because of the above\n- updated installer and documentation dependencies\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4242","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4242/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4242/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4242/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4242","id":116912036,"number":4242,"title":"Different render result XNA/MonoGame","user":{"login":"KakCAT","id":2372854,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2372854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT","html_url":"https://github.com/KakCAT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-11-14T08:56:14Z","updated_at":"2015-11-14T11:14:53Z","closed_at":"2015-11-14T11:14:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The following code:\n\n```\nTexture2D tex;\nSpriteBatch batch;\n```\n\n....\n\n```\nif (tex==null)\n{\n    tex=new Texture2D (g.GraphicsDevice,1,1);\n    Color []col=new Color [1];

(\"red\" is a 800x600 red texture)\n- launch the game, the default size is 800x600\n- press space, the game is resized to 1680x1050 with fullscreen\n- press space again, the game returns to windowed mode, but the size is still 10680x1050 instead of 800x600\n\nHere's the snippet:\n\n``` C#\nusing Microsoft.Xna.Framework;\nusing Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics;\nusing Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input;\n\nnamespace FullScreenTestGL\n{\n    public class Game1 : Game\n    {\n        private GraphicsDeviceManager _graphics;\n        private SpriteBatch _spriteBatch;\n        private Texture2D _texture;\n        private KeyboardState _oldKeyboardState;\n        private KeyboardState _newKeyboardState;\n\n        public Game1()\n        {\n            Content.RootDirectory = \"Content\";\n            _graphics = new GraphicsDeviceManager(this);\n        }\n\n        protected override void Initialize()\n        {\n            base.Initialize();\n\n            _spriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(GraphicsDevice);\n            _oldKeyboardState = new KeyboardState();\n            _newKeyboardState = new KeyboardState();\n        }\n\n        protected override void LoadContent()\n        {\n            _texture = Content.Load<Texture2D>(\"red\");\n            base.LoadContent();\n        }\n\n        protected override void Update(GameTime gameTime)\n        {\n            _oldKeyboardState = _newKeyboardState;\n            _newKeyboardState = Keyboard.GetState();\n\n            if (_oldKeyboardState.IsKeyUp(Keys.Space) && _newKeyboardState.IsKeyDown(Keys.Space))\n            {\n                if (_graphics.IsFullScreen)\n                {\n                    _graphics.IsFullScreen = false;\n                    _graphics.PreferredBackBufferWidth = 800;\n                    _graphics.PreferredBackBufferHeight = 600;\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                    _graphics.IsFullScreen = true;\n                    // put any value supported by your monitor\n                    _graphics.PreferredBackBufferWidth = 1680;  \n                    _graphics.PreferredBackBufferHeight = 1050;\n                }\n                _graphics.ApplyChanges();\n            }\n\n            base.Update(gameTime);\n        }\n\n        protected override void Draw(GameTime gameTime)\n        {\n            GraphicsDevice.Clear(Color.CornflowerBlue);\n            _spriteBatch.Begin();\n            _spriteBatch.Draw(_texture, Vector2.Zero, Color.White);\n            _spriteBatch.End();\n            base.Draw(gameTime);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis bug doesn't occur on a Windows DirectX project (only on Windows GL). Tested with Monogame 3.4 and 3.5.0.730.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4226","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4226/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4226/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4226/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4226","id":115491493,"number":4226,"title":"[pipeline] El Capitan did some weird stuff with the $PATH and /usr/bin","user":{"login":"dellis1972","id":810617,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/810617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972","html_url":"https://github.com/dellis1972","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":13477514,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/ContentPipeline","name":"ContentPipeline","color":"ededed","default":false},{"id":526070,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/MacOS","name":"MacOS","color":"9600fd","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/8/labels","id":1324448,"number":8,"title":"3.5 Release","description":"","creator":{"login":"dellis1972","id":810617,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/810617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972","html_url":"https://github.com/dellis1972","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":49,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-09-25T19:48:58Z","updated_at":"2016-04-04T08:00:50Z","due_on":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-03-16T02:13:41Z"},"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-11-06T11:51:03Z","updated_at":"2016-08-04T07:54:58Z","closed_at":"2015-11-07T17:29:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/4226","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4226","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4226.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4226.patch"},"body":"Because of these changes mono can no longer be created in /usr/bin\nas its read only.

In the Windows monitor settings, they appear as 59Hz (i.e. truncated). But in MonoGame, they're being rounded to 60Hz.\n\nNormally I guess this wouldn't be much of an issue. But on one of my PCs I have both 59Hz and 60Hz modes, so in MonoGame they are both appearing as 60Hz and look like duplicates.\n\nSo the refresh rate needs to at least be truncated to match Windows. However, given that `DisplayMode.RefreshRate` seems to be a MonoGame only property (I couldn't find it in XNA), is there any reason why we can't just make it a float so that the precise refresh rate can be retrieved?\n\nPS. I'm more than happy to submit a PR for this. But I just wanted to confirm how this should be resolved first.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4221/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4220","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4220/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4220/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4220/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4220","id":114955715,"number":4220,"title":"\"SupportedDisplayModes\" returns no results (Windows DirectX)","user":{"login":"MichaelDePiazzi","id":5249498,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5249498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi","html_url":"https://github.com/MichaelDePiazzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelDePiazzi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2015-11-04T02:31:07Z","updated_at":"2015-11-17T17:40:11Z","closed_at":"2015-11-17T17:40:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"One of my testers recently tried my game on an older laptop they had. When they tried to set the video resolution though, there were none to select from. Looking into it, `GraphicsAdapter.DefaultAdapter.SupportedDisplayModes` was not returning anything at all.\n\nAfter some investigation, I found the issue - the laptop only had BGR video modes (specifically `B5G6R5_UNorm`, `B8G8R8A8_UNorm`, and `B8G8R8A8_UNorm_SRgb`). But MonoGame is currently only looking for `R8G8B8A8_UNorm` modes.\n\nDoes anyone see any issue with enumerating through all the different `SharpDX.DXGI.Format` values and translating them to the relevant XNA `SurfaceFormat.Color`? (e.g. `Format.B5G6R5_UNorm` -> `SurfaceFormat.Bgr565`, `Format.B8G8R8A8_UNorm` -> `SurfaceFormat.Bgra32`, etc.)\n\nI did notice that WindowGL is currently excluding everything but 32-bit colour modes. I'm not sure if there's a specific reason for this, but I thought it might be relevant and worth mentioning.\n\nPS. I'm more than happy to submit a PR for this.
