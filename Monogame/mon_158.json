After looking in the debugger a bit, it appears that the `_touchScale` variable is `{X:Infinity Y:Infinity}`, which seems to me like it may be a problem.\n\nAfter digging in the source for `TouchPanel`, it appears that the problem is here:\n\n```\n_touchScale = new Vector2(  (float)DisplayWidth / windowSize.X,\n                            (float)DisplayHeight / windowSize.Y);\n```\n\nFor some reason, on my windows phone, it appears that it isn't able to get a value for windowSize (or windowSize is set to 0, resulting in the infinity), which probably means a bug exists in `WPGameWindow`.\n\nI'll be trying to step through the source after I post this to figure out exactly what's going on, but I wanted to report this here in case there's a known solution to this problem.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1265","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1265/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1265/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1265/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1265","id":10453693,"number":1265,"title":"GraphicsCapabilites.GetNonPowerOfTwo(device) NullReferenceException","user":{"login":"machinamentum","id":1700799,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1700799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/machinamentum","html_url":"https://github.com/machinamentum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/machinamentum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/machinamentum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/machinamentum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/machinamentum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/machinamentum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/machinamentum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/machinamentum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/machinamentum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/machinamentum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2013-01-30T10:35:07Z","updated_at":"2014-04-26T23:51:34Z","closed_at":"2014-04-26T23:51:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"On line 84 of GraphicsCapabilites.cs for MacOS X,\n\n```\nGL.GetInteger(GetPName.MaxTextureSize, out maxTextureSize);\n```\n\nSystem.NullReferenceException is thrown.

I traced it back to differences in the Texture2D.GetData which I subsequently use to draw some pixelated sprites.\n\nSo debugging side by side with my laptop and desktop at the point of calling GetData on the same texture, my laptop returns one set of Colors and my desktop returns another set of Colors.\n\nDigging in further, I noticed that the actual data stream coming from MapSubresource was different.\n\nI added some code to capture the return variable (MapSubresource actually returns a DataBox) and inspected the DataBox on both machines.  On my Laptop the RowPitch was 128 which lines up with the expectation that 4 x 32 (RGBA is 4 bytes, 32 pixels is the width of my texture) is the RowPitch.\n\nHowever, there's no guaranteeing that the mapped resource will be perfectly packed.  My Desktop has a RowPitch of 256, so there's a lot of data that needs to be skipped over.\n\nIn other words, just blindly using:\n\n``` C#\nstream.ReadRange(data, startIndex, elementCount);\n```\n\nWill not account for RowPitch and will yield incorrect Color data on some machines.\n\nI have a work around in place (that proved to me this was the issue) which changes the last part of GetData to look like this:\n\n``` C#\nint mipSize = 0;\n                    var box = d3dContext.MapSubresource(stagingTex, 0, 0, SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.Read, SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapFlags.None, out mipSize);\n\n                    var dataPtr = box.DataPointer;\n                    var start = startIndex;\n                    for (int i = 0; i < height; i++)\n                    {\n                        SharpDX.Utilities.Read(dataPtr, data, start, width);\n                        dataPtr += box.RowPitch;\n                        start += width;\n                    }\n```\n\nThis allows the GetData to yield correct results on both of my machines.\n\nHowever, the above code is not something I would propose as a pull request because its not accounting for the elementCount parameter (I just happen to always ask for all elements in my usage so this workaround is very specific at the moment). \n\nAlso there are more complexities when considering multiple depths (and then having to factor in DepthPitch which I am ignoring here).\n\nJust wanted to bring this issue up in case someone with more graphics experience wants to make a solid/generic fix and in case anyone else runs into this they can now know the reason why.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1258","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1258/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1258/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1258/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1258","id":10434308,"number":1258,"title":"Fixes

In the future this can be extended to test for other things.\n\nThis feature is important because when you supply non PoT mip maps and the device doesn't support them, you will GL errors. Also, on Android some devices support them and others don't, meaning you may test your game and have it work fine but once released it will crash on other devices.\n\nThe support for mip maps with non-PoT textures is patchy, but more and more devices have support so it'd be a shame to disable it outright.\n\nSo far I've tested on an iPad 1, Windows 7, Android 4.0 Samsung GalaxyS2, and a MacBook (not pro).\n\nThe only part I'm not confident about is the handling of OPENGL non-GLES platforms (ie desktop PC, Mac and Linux). I took the advice given here: http://aras-p.info/blog/2012/10/17/non-power-of-two-textures/ (OpenGL section), which suggests a more reliable way of deciding on PoT support is whether the card supports 8192 sized textures. This is pretty safe. The only risk is that certain older devices that don't support 8192 textures but do fully support non-PoT textures will have their non-PoT mip maps discarded. Not likely to be a problem IMO as non PoT textures are mostly for UI elements and not likely to have mip maps anyway.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1253","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1253/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1253/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1253/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1253","id":10402093,"number":1253,"title":"Support
