MGFX is MonoGame's own FX file format which has the following goals:\n- Support a similar technique, passes, shaders structure as Microsoft FX files.\n- Have a textual format for ease of editing.\n- Have a compiled and optimized binary format for runtime use.\n- Be cross-platform and support OpenGL, GLES, and DirectX shader formats.\n- Easy to extend for future platforms and features.\n\nAt this time only the binary format of MGFX is implemented for use on OpenGL/GLES.  In the coming weeks I will be adding the textual format and DirectX shader support for WinRT.\n\nThere is a new Tools folder in this update which contains the '2MGFX' tool for compiling MGFX files.  It currently goes right from Microsoft FX files to a compiled MGFX file, but will soon support the textual MGFX format as both an input and output format.  The tool currently is Windows only, but we will be fixing it to run on OSX and Linux.\n\nIn the MonoGame.Framework\\Graphics\\Effect\\Resources folder you'll find Microsoft's \"StockEffects Sample\" .FX files along with precompiled .mgfx files and a Windows batch file which converts one into the other.\n\nNote the \"ShaderTests\" test fails at this moment because they use Microsoft FX files which need to be converted to MGFX.  I will work with kungfubanana to get the right files in there soon.\n\nThese changes have been tested on Windows, iOS, and OSX.  It should work fine on Android and Linux, but we have not tested it personally.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/430/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/429","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/429/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/429/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/429/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/429","id":4216937,"number":429,"title":"Changes

My universal app is set to support LandscapeLeft and LandscapeRight only on iPhone and iPad. When I load it onto the device, i typically start in LandscapeLeft (home button on the left) and everything works as expected. I started my app in LandscapeRight for a change, and the drawing behavior has changed.\n1. Stuff drawn using Rendertarget2D are now scaled smaller (taking up the upper left quarter of the space)\n2. Places where I do my own GL 2.0 are also scaled the same way.\n\nIf I turn the device upside down to LandscapeLeft, my GL 2.0 drawing jumps into correct position and works fine from then on, but all the RenderTarget stuff still looks funny. My best guess is initial settings used by RenderTargets are not reset.\n\nAnyone know what this could be? or where I can start to look? I do not see this behavior on the iPhone.\n\nI CAN get this behavior to happen in the simulator, I have to open it, close the app all the way, rotate the device, then open it again since it defaults to left orientation.\n\nIn the simulator, in LandscapeLeft, there is a point during loading where the loading screen blinks upsidedown for a moment before it returns to LandscapeLeft. My best guess is there is an orientation change happening that is forcing the right variables to be initialized or something.\n\nUpon further testing, it looks like if I restrict supported orientations to LandscapeRight ONLY or LandscapeLeft ONLY, the problem presents itself in the simulator right off the bat. Up to now a forced orientation changed event might be what's making it work at all.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/424/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/423","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/423/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/423/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/423/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/423","id":4078367,"number":423,"title":"Initial WinRT changes, temp NOMOJO path, and iOS fixes.","user":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2012-04-12T05:05:33Z","updated_at":"2014-06-24T00:13:57Z","closed_at":"2012-04-16T13:02:49Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/423","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/423","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/423.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/423.patch"},"body":"Hey all.\n\nThe big thing in here is the initial projects and code for WinRT.  Alot of code is just stubbed out and untested... still latest SharpDX is in, it will load a game, initialize D3D11 and do clears/presents, but not do much more.  WinRT is heavily a WIP.\n\nSecond is the temporary NOMOJO path to disable Mojoshader at runtime.  This is only enabled on the iOS project, but could easily be done for other platforms.  This is totally temporary and will be replaced within a week or so by the new \"MonoGame Effect\" path with offline MojoShader.\n\nI did full pass here removing all GLES 1.1 code in all of MonoGame… it is dead.\n\nLast is a bunch of misc fixes found trying to get ARMED! running on iOS and WinRT.\n\nSorry for the big pull...  i promise to submit smaller chunks in the future. :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/423/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/422","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/422/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/422/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/422/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/422","id":4016914,"number":422,"title":"Texture2D - Support for SaveAsPng and SaveAsJpeg","user":{"login":"RandolphBurt","id":1282232,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1282232?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandolphBurt","html_url":"https://github.com/RandolphBurt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandolphBurt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandolphBurt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandolphBurt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandolphBurt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandolphBurt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandolphBurt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandolphBurt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandolphBurt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandolphBurt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2012-04-07T18:24:30Z","updated_at":"2014-07-08T00:28:40Z","closed_at":"2012-04-10T09:50:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/422","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/422","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/422.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/422.patch"},"body":"Added the methods SaveAsPng and SaveAsJpeg.  \nBoth of these methods (and the CreateRGBImageFromBufferData method that they call) are taken from the MacOS MonoGame implementation with a very minor change to the CGImageAlphaInfo declaration to ensure the correct Alpha channel is stored and to ensure the Red and Blue are in the correct order.\n\nNOTE: One issue is that the XNA representation of this method takes a Stream whereas this version takes a filename.

guys,\ni am facing two problems with MonoGame for Android when deploying on a real device.\n\nDevelopment Device/Informations:\n- Visual Studio 2010, Monogame 2.5.0.0, Xamarin MonoDroid\n- The developement device i am using is a Samsung Galaxy W SGH-T679M (OS 2.3)\n- According to the informations i found on the web, the GPU is => Qualcomm Adreno (TM) 205 / OpenGL ES-CM 1.1\n- I develop on this device to have as much compatibility as possible with the different devices (old & new)\n\nWhen porting a Windows Phone XNA game to Android using MonoDroid/MonoGame, the game is working fine, load quickly and everything works well in the emulator.\n\nHowever, when deploying on a real device i am facing these two problems:\n\n1) Load Time:\n- The load time to launch my game vary between 90sec to 120sec. Even when removing any Assets Loading code, the game still take that long to launch.\n- I tried the CatapultWars Demo, it take really long to load but the game itself work flawlessly.\n- I tried to create an empty OpenGL project with MonoDroid and keep the spinning square demo and it is loading in ~2-3sec. and run really smooth.\n\n---\n\n2) Textures invisible\n- Beside the load time problem, my textures are not visible on a real device, even tho everything works fine in the Emulator(OS 2.2). All i can see is the GraphicsDevice.Clear color.\n- I am using PNG, non power of 2(work in the emulator anyway). Even when using Power of 2 textures i have no success.\n\nThanks in advance!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/412/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/411","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/411/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/411/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/411/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/411","id":3901054,"number":411,"title":"Fix TextFieldAlertView for iOS5.","user":{"login":"azchohfi","id":527713,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/527713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi","html_url":"https://github.com/azchohfi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2012-03-30T16:48:52Z","updated_at":"2014-07-11T11:55:40Z","closed_at":"2012-03-30T18:01:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/411","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/411","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/411.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/411.patch"},"body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/410","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/410/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/410/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/410/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/410","id":3900996,"number":410,"title":"Fix TextFieldAlertView for iOS5.","user":{"login":"azchohfi","id":527713,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/527713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi","html_url":"https://github.com/azchohfi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azchohfi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2012-03-30T16:44:32Z","updated_at":"2014-06-17T06:23:31Z","closed_at":"2012-03-30T16:49:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/410","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/410","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/410.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/410.patch"},"body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4738","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507242346","x-github-request-id":"BF4A:572C:1581A7C:2AB794A:59D6A9D0","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=187>;
