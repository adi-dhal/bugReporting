This is fine if you have the old SDK installed but the current SDK is 10.0.10586.0. Without the old version installed you cannot create a new Windows 10 project. The dependency versioning is complicated and probably the cause of some issues people are having so here's what I'm seeing:\n\nThe 3.4 build uses an old TargetPlatformVersion in the .csproj template as well it's missing the project.json file (the zip file it installs is also named WindowUAP.zip and should be WindowsUniversal.zip)\n\nThe 3.5 build uses the 10240 TargetPlatformVersion and has the extra files with the correctly named zip file.\n\nIf you go to the SDK archive page and download the RTM version (https://dev.windows.com/en-us/downloads/sdk-archive) it will install version 10.0.10240 of the SDK which works with the 3.5 build (the version displayed on the screen says 10.0.26624 whcih installs to the 10.0.10240.0 folder which works with the 3.5 build). Confused?\n\nYou have to download the current SDK (https://dev.windows.com/en-us/downloads/windows-10-sdk) to get version 10586 so I'm going to submit a pull request that sets the minimum version to 10240 and the target version to 10586. This works for people that have the old SDK installed and the new one.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4368","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4368/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4368/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4368/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4368","id":124471688,"number":4368,"title":"Monogame using.net4.5 is incompatible with visual studio 2010 express","user":{"login":"stampergames","id":8113304,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8113304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stampergames","html_url":"https://github.com/stampergames","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stampergames/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stampergames/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stampergames/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stampergames/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stampergames/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stampergames/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stampergames/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stampergames/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stampergames/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":18,"created_at":"2015-12-31T13:39:51Z","updated_at":"2016-01-21T21:27:47Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"After running \"Protobuild\", the \"TargetFrameworkVersion\" property in the generated .csproj files reference \"V4.5\" which appears incompatible with visual studio 2010 express.

The .csproj file template uses the wrong TargetPlatformVersion and TargetPlatformMinVersion values. They're 10.0.10069.0 for both values and should be at least 10.0.10240.0 but if you're using the latest SDK then the TargetPlatformMinVersion should be 10.0.10240.0 and TargetPlatformVersion should be 10.0.10586.0. This is correct in the github source but the 3.4 zip file contains an old version.\n2. The project.json file is missing in the zip file. This will fail the build if you get past the version check by manually editing the .csproj file and reloading.

it be ok to do so in `OpenTKGamePlatform.ResetWindowBounds()`?\n\n```\n            if (device != null)\n            {\n                PresentationParameters parms = device.PresentationParameters;\n

installed on the MonoGame build server\n- Add some command line flag like `--force-mac-api-version MonoMac` to Protobuild\n- Add build targets to test it\n- Only ship one of these implementations in

that the vertex array was only growing to exactly match the number of items in a batch, rather than growing by a percentage like the sprite batch array is.

However, I still use the internal content pipeline to process assets from their raw formats to the platform-specific binary data.\n\nThe issue I'm having is that the content importers accept a filename instead of a stream or byte array.  This means that I'm either forced to copy the content importer implementation into Protogame, or write out the binary data to a temporary file on disk before importing it.\n\nI'm proposing that we add the following signature to `ContentImporter<T>`:\n\n```\npublic virtual T Import(Stream input, ContentImporterContext context)\n{\n  // default implementation that writes to a temporary file\n}\n```\n\nThen for all the MonoGame implementations we can move most of the code into an `override` of this method, and change the `Import` that uses a filename to read the file binary data before calling the stream-based version.  By doing it this way, we ensure that we don't break anyone who is currently deriving from `ContentImporter` (because the method we're adding is virtual, and provides an implementation that is backwards-compatible, if less ideal).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4342/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4341","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4341/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4341/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4341/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4341","id":123114318,"number":4341,"title":"Updated Protobuild","user":{"login":"cra0zy","id":6773302,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6773302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy","html_url":"https://github.com/cra0zy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2015-12-19T22:28:19Z","updated_at":"2015-12-22T09:45:14Z","closed_at":"2015-12-22T09:43:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/4341","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4341","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4341.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4341.patch"},"body":"This fixes the Linux Pipeline Tool problem @hach-que caused with #4282\n\nLong story short, she did not merge changes of #4243 done to xslt so LocalCopy was setting to true, and because libraries were being copied, Pipeline Tool would use local dlls instead of system ones(and this causes a crash because no config files are copied and tool tries to load Window dlls).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4341/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4340","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4340/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4340/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4340/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4340","id":123102314,"number":4340,"title":"Concensus?
