The goal was to improve FBX support. If a model can be previewed in the [Assimp viewer](http://assimp.sourceforge.net/main_viewer.html), then MonoGame should be able to import it.\n\nStill, there are tons of FBX models that Assimp does not support. I think this is the best we can do in MonoGame, everything else needs to be fixed in Assimp.\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I have mostly tested the FBX importer with our custom model processor. Our model processor now works with the XNA content pipeline and the MonoGame content pipeline (same code).\nPlease test your models with MonoGame's ModelProcessor!\n\n**Notes about XNA vs. MonoGame/Assimp:**\nXNA was built with the 2006.11 version of the FBX exporter. It may or may not support newer FBX versions. This is totally unpredictable. It depends on the internal structure of the FBX file -- the actual file version is secondary.\n\nAssimp supports FBX version 7.1 (FBX 2011), 7.2 (FBX 2012), and 7.3 (FBX 2013). That means most original XNA models need to be converted to a newer version.\nAssimp is not as powerful as the FBX SDK. It is best to check each FBX file in the [Assimp viewer](http://assimp.sourceforge.net/main_viewer.html). If the model does not look right in the viewer, then it can't be imported with MonoGame. The model needs to be fixed in 3dsmax (or another tool).\n\nFor example: The XNA's Dude.fbx from the [SkinningSample](http://xbox.create.msdn.com/en-US/education/catalog/sample/skinned_model) needs to be converted to a newer FBX version. But even then it can't be loaded by Assimp. We had to fix pivots/transforms and animations manually in 3dsmax.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3335","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3335/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3335/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3335/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3335","id":53114112,"number":3335,"title":"Fix for building external references","user":{"login":"mgarstenauer","id":8617071,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/8617071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarstenauer","html_url":"https://github.com/mgarstenauer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarstenauer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarstenauer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarstenauer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarstenauer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarstenauer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarstenauer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarstenauer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarstenauer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarstenauer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-12-30T13:00:55Z","updated_at":"2015-05-06T08:36:58Z","closed_at":"2014-12-31T00:06:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/3335","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3335","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3335.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3335.patch"},"body":"A few changes were required to build my existing XNA content.\n\n`ContentProcessorContext.BuildAndLoadAsset` can be called with `processorName = null`. In this case XNA imports the asset, but does not process it. This is for example used in http://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnhar/archive/2010/06/18/merging-animation-files.aspx.\n\n`ContentProcessorContext.BuildAsset` does not yet generate automatic names, such as \"AssetName_i\". The name is currently hardcoded as \"AssetName_0\". But in our content project, we have multiple multiple assets with the same name. For example: a model \"House.fbx\" uses a material \"House.drmat\", which references a texture \"House.tga\". In this case MGCB should create \"House.xnb\", \"House_0.xnb\", \"House_1.xnb\". \nA texture \"House.tga\" may be referenced by multiple materials. Sometimes \"House.tga\" needs to be processed multiple times with different settings. In this case multiple files need to be created (\"House_1.xnb\", House_2.xnb\", \"House_3.xnb\"). When the \"House.tga\" is processed multiple times with the same settings, the file should be reused (create only \"House_1.xnb\").\nI have added the necessary changes. All PipelineBuildEvents are now tracked in a dictionary.

Local transforms, animations, are ignored.\n\nThis commit adds the following fixes:\n- All nodes in the scene need to be transformed using a \"similarity transform\". (For example, imagine a model with two separate mesh nodes: A character holding a gun. The model was exported with z-up (3dsmax), but XNA requires y-up. A -90° around the x-axis needs to be applied. If `TransformScene` only rotates the meshes then gun would no longer be attached to the character. `TransformScene` needs to rotate the meshes and correct the local transforms.)\n- Animations need to be transformed as well. (Same principle.)\n- Normals need to be transformed with the transpose of the inverse. This is relevant when non-uniform scaling is applied. (`Vector3.TransformNormal` doesn't automatically invert/transpose the transform. `TransformNormal` only means that the translation is ignored.)\n- When the transform is mirroring the mesh, the winding order needs to be swapped.\n\nI also simplified lines like these\n\n```\nchannel.Items.CopyTo(geomBuffer, 0);\nVector3.TransformNormal(geomBuffer, ref xform, geomBuffer);\nchannel.Items.Clear();\nforeach (var item in geomBuffer)\n    channel.Items.Add(item);\n```\n\nto\n\n```\nfor (int i = 0; i < vector3Channel.Count; i++)\n    vector3Channel[i] = Vector3.TransformNormal(vector3Channel[i], inverseTranspose);\n```\n\nThe second version is easier to maintain. (I assume the original author tried to optimize the operation. But I doubt that the original code is any faster. It requires more heap memory allocations/copies. When `channel.Items.Add(item)` is called each individual Vector3 needs to be boxed/unboxed!)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3331/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3330","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3330/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3330/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3330/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3330","id":53040916,"number":3330,"title":"Vertex channel conversion","user":{"login":"mgarstenauer","id":8617071,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/8617071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarstenauer","html_url":"https://github.com/mgarstenauer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarstenauer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarstenauer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarstenauer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarstenauer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarstenauer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarstenauer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarstenauer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarstenauer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgarstenauer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-12-29T13:25:45Z","updated_at":"2015-05-06T08:38:42Z","closed_at":"2014-12-29T19:58:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/3330","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3330","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3330.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3330.patch"},"body":"In the XNA content pipeline vertex colors are usually imported as `VertexChannel<Vector4>`.\nIn the MonoGame content pipeline vertex colors seem to be imported as `VertexChannel<Color>`.\nThat's just a minor difference - no problem so far.\n\nWhen the mesh is processed in my custom model processor, I call \n\n```\ngeometryContent.Vertices.Channels.ConvertChannelContent<Color>(colorChannelIndex);\n```\n\nThis call fails in MonoGame because `VertexChannel<Color>` cannot be converted to `VertexChannel<Color>`.
