This round tripping exposed several bugs where the `IntermediateSerializer` worked correctly to XNA behavior, but either the `ContentCompiler` failed to serialize the type into XNB format correctly or the  `ContentManager` couldn't load the compiled content type.\n\nNote I considered writing separate `ContentCompiler` and `ContentManager` tests, but for these binary serializations it seems like the resulting code would have been extremely redundant to what the  `IntermediateSerializer` tests already did.\n\nSo this extra testing solved a few different bugs:\n- We were not including the underlying type when serializing `EnumWriter<T>`.\n- We were not including the base type when serializing with the `ReflectiveWriter<T>`.\n- Fixed serialization and deserialization of polymorphic types (Fixes #2817).\n- Fixed case where non-public getters were being ignored.\n- Implemented getter for `FontDescription.CharacterRegions`.\n- `OpaqueDataDictionary` was missing the content \"item name\" attribute.\n- We now use `CanDeserializeIntoExistingObject` to serialize getter only properties.\n- Fixed a few cases where `existingInstance` wasn't being obeyed.\n- Cleaned up `ContentReader` removed a lot of redundant code.\n- Added clear exception when the `typeReaderIndex` is out of bounds.\n\nNow I haven't tested this beyond just the unit tests.  It is possible a broke something, so it would be great for people with lots of content in their game to give this a test before we merge things.\n\nThanks to @Firedragonweb for poking me on this!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3279/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3278","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3278/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3278/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3278/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3278","id":52153438,"number":3278,"title":"Fixed typo #3275","user":{"login":"Nezz","id":431167,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/431167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz","html_url":"https://github.com/Nezz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-12-16T19:06:38Z","updated_at":"2014-12-16T19:38:38Z","closed_at":"2014-12-16T19:35:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/3278","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3278","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3278.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3278.patch"},"body":"#3275\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3278/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3277","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3277/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3277/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3277/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3277","id":52080323,"number":3277,"title":"Picked up this tutorial series with Part 7.","user":{"login":"cclements1384","id":3178544,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3178544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclements1384","html_url":"https://github.com/cclements1384","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclements1384/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclements1384/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclements1384/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclements1384/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclements1384/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclements1384/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclements1384/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclements1384/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclements1384/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-12-16T07:05:25Z","updated_at":"2014-12-17T03:18:54Z","closed_at":"2014-12-17T03:18:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/3277","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3277","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3277.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3277.patch"},"body":"I decided to pick up where this tutorial left off.
