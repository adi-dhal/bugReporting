I use this method (with tiny changes) on a game I've already released, and it works perfectly, but when I try to use the same code as in that other game to scale the screen in this game, it only works SOME of the time. I'm not sure what changes it between deploys, but it's really slowing the development down. In the other game that the method works perfectly on, I had finished the game before Monogame 3.0 was out of beta, but I was using the current one at the time from github (this was in December of 2012). In this new game I'm using MonoGame 3.0 because it's out of beta. Anyone else had this problem or has heard of it and know of a solution?Let me know what more I need to post if this doesn't tell you what you need to know about the issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1361/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1360","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1360/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1360/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1360/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1360","id":10952080,"number":1360,"title":"Windows 8: touch point gets \"stuck\" after using XAML/SIP on touch screen device","user":{"login":"AdamDawes","id":2230300,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2230300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamDawes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2013-02-13T12:56:12Z","updated_at":"2017-09-21T13:57:56Z","closed_at":"2017-09-21T13:57:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I've found what appears to be a bug in the public release of MonoGame3 running in Windows 8 on a touch screen device (Surface RT). Attached is a simple example project that can be used to reproduce the problem.\n\nDescription of problem:\nAfter displaying a simple piece of XAML which includes a text field, setting focus to the text field so that the SIP appears, and then scrolling the XAML content, a touch point is added to the array returned by each call to TouchPanel.GetState() that remains even after contact is released from the screen and cannot be removed.\n\nAttachment:\nhttp://www.adamdawes.com/private/MonoGameStuckTouchpoint.zip\n\nExample project:\nThe project is a simple empty MonoGame Windows Store project, inside which a couple of XAML controls have been added to the GamePage. These include a textbox and a button, and are initially collapsed so that they cannot be seen.\n\nIn the game's Update function, the code checks to see whether a single touch point with a state of \"Pressed\" has been encountered. If so, it makes the XAML controls visible and sets the focus to the textbox. This causes the SIP to appear on a touch device. Due to the way Windows handles scrolling, the OK button is hidden behind the SIP.\n\nIf the user swipes the main area of the page (above the SIP) upwards to reveal the OK button, a touch point ends up \"stuck\" in MonoGame and is returned from every call to TouchPanel.GetState(), even though the user has released contact with the screen.\n\nTo reproduce:\n- Run the attached project on a touch screen device with no hardware keyboard (e.g., Surface)\n- Note that the project continually displays the number of items returned from TouchPanel.GetState into the debug window (initially always zero).\n- Tap the screen. The XAML controls appear, as does the SIP. Because the textbox has focus, it scrolls upwards so that it is displayed immediately above the SIP.\n- The debug output still shows zeros at this point.\n- Swipe the \"non-SIP\" part of the screen upwards to reveal the OK button, and release contact with the screen. The debug output now continually shows \"1\" instead of \"0\". An unexpected touch point is constantly present within the Touch Panel and cannot be removed.\n\nI've experienced this a couple of times but only yesterday tracked down what was triggering it. This is causing me some real problems in my games as when I ask the user to enter their name for the high-score table, should they happen to scroll the XAML controls then the game locks up due to this unexpected touch point and has to be closed. A workaround and/or fix would be very much appreciated.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1359","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1359/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1359/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1359/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1359","id":10945826,"number":1359,"title":"(Andorid) TouchPanel ReadGesture - game freezes","user":{"login":"DenisGrachev","id":3581505,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3581505?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisGrachev","html_url":"https://github.com/DenisGrachev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisGrachev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisGrachev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisGrachev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisGrachev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisGrachev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisGrachev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisGrachev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisGrachev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenisGrachev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2013-02-13T09:32:36Z","updated_at":"2013-02-13T09:33:32Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"During a porting my games to Android find a bug.

The reason _sound is null is because fileName was:\n\n```\n   (notice the '/' at the beginning of the file name)\n   /content/screens/globalcontentscreen/MenuSong.mp3\n```\n\nI ran some tests and it seems if the leading slash is present, then AVAudioPlayer.FromUrl returns a null instance.  If the leading slash is not there, then AVAudioPlayer.FromUrl works just fine.\n\nSo I researched why the leading slash exists and it's because the caller of the Song constructor (SongReader) is inappropriately putting a leading slash on this line of code:\n\n```\npath = input.ContentManager.RootDirectory + separator + path;\n```\n\nIn my case input.ContentManager.RootDirectory is empty (it's \"\" ).\n\nI believe the code should be:\n\n```\nif(!string.IsNullOrEmpty(input.ContentManager.RootDirectory))\n{\n     path = input.ContentManager.RootDirectory + separator + path;\n}\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1342","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1342/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1342/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1342/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1342","id":10819028,"number":1342,"title":"Effect.Clone return value has no CurrentTechnique","user":{"login":"kg","id":198130,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/198130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kg","html_url":"https://github.com/kg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2013-02-10T05:55:35Z","updated_at":"2013-02-10T07:19:35Z","closed_at":"2013-02-10T05:57:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"On PSM, at least, if I do Effect.Clone, the return value's CurrentTechnique is null.
