MonoGame 3.3, moving the mouse generates a fair amount of garbage; I'm not sure if it is related to low level OpenTK implementation or to the MonoGame layer.\n\nIn this example, the screen flashes red during every generation 0 collection and the memory allocation is shown in the title bar. Just move the mouse and watch.\n\n```\nusing Microsoft.Xna.Framework;\nusing Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics;\nusing Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input;\nusing System;\n\nnamespace OpenTKTest\n{\n    public class Game1 : Game\n    {\n        GraphicsDeviceManager graphics;\n\n        public Game1()\n            : base()\n        {\n            graphics = new GraphicsDeviceManager(this);\n            Content.RootDirectory = \"Content\";\n        }\n        private int lastG0CollCT = 0;\n        protected override void Draw(GameTime gameTime)\n        {\n            Window.Title = \"Mem: \" + (GC.GetTotalMemory(false) / (1024d * 1024)).ToString(\"N2\");\n            GraphicsDevice.Clear(GC.CollectionCount(0) == lastG0CollCT ?

So in Direct3D, anything in NDC space with `z < 0` will be clipped, while in OpenGL anything in NDC space with `z < -1` will be clipped.\n\nThe `Matrix.CreateOrthographic*` and `Matrix.CreatePerspective` methods use Direct3D conventions, so the NDC depth range created by these methods is from 0 to 1.\n\nAs far as I can see, that means that MonoGame's OpenGL renderer only ever uses half of the available depth range. Worse, near plane clipping doesn't work properly, because objects that _should_ be behind the near clip plane, and therefore clipped, in fact aren't, because the near clip plane ends up (potentially) behind the camera. (That's how I noticed this bug - something that should have been clipped wasn't being clipped.)\n\nThe only mention I can find of this issue is over on FNA, here: flibitijibibo/FNA#282. @flibitijibibo mentioned a possible solution: `glClipControl`, and implemented it for FNA [here](https://github.com/flibitijibibo/FNA/commit/99019befdc4eb6d2de31706d0e89b7532affce3e), but it's only available in recent versions of OpenGL. You can also modify the `Matrix` methods that create projection matrices, but obviously that's not a general solution. @flibitijibibo has also added a note to the FNA docs about the issue, [here](https://github.com/flibitijibibo/FNA/wiki/2:-Building-with-FNA#depth-clipping-accuracy).\n\nBut I feel like I must be missing something, because surely this would have been noticed before now?\n\n_(Note: MonoGame uses `posFixup` to account for the difference between Direct3D and OpenGL in the 0 location for the screen-space Y-coordinate. That's related to this, but it doesn't solve the NDC Z-coordinate problem.)_\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3658/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3657","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3657/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3657/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3657/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3657","id":64003014,"number":3657,"title":"Where to get the MonoGame 3.3 iOS assembly?","user":{"login":"deadlydog","id":1187140,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1187140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deadlydog","html_url":"https://github.com/deadlydog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deadlydog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deadlydog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deadlydog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deadlydog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deadlydog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deadlydog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deadlydog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deadlydog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deadlydog/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":12,"created_at":"2015-03-24T14:06:24Z","updated_at":"2017-05-03T03:55:08Z","closed_at":"2017-05-03T03:55:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I downloaded and installed MonoGame 3.3 for Visual Studio, but looks like the iOS files were not included; \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MonoGame\\v3.0\\Assemblies\\iOS\" is empty.

You'd calculate the value for the `level` parameter using something similar to Direct3D's [D3D11CalcSubresource](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff476081%28v=vs.85%29.aspx), which we'd need to expose as a new API.\n\nIf this looks like something that would be of interest, then I'd be happy to work on a PR. I just wanted to first see if it matches MG's goals.\n\n(My use-case: for cascaded shadow maps, it's nice to use a Texture2D array. The alternative is to use a single texture containing all the shadow maps, with offsets to sample from the correct cascade. It's certainly do-able without texture arrays, but more elegant with them.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3653/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3652","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3652/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3652/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3652/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3652","id":63590018,"number":3652,"title":"iOS freeze & crash when attempting to resume following incoming call","user":{"login":"Ben-P","id":3022580,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3022580?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-P","html_url":"https://github.com/Ben-P","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-P/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-P/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-P/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-P/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-P/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-P/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-P/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-P/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-P/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2015-03-22T23:28:24Z","updated_at":"2015-12-09T10:48:58Z","closed_at":"2015-12-09T10:48:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When returning to a monogame game having received a call, the game screen displays, but updates do not resume.
