part of the FileHelpers things for #2555\n\nThis is an easy one that makes a nice cleanup, so submitting it by itself.\n\nThe remaining FileHelpers are mostly just used by StorageDevice, so maybe we leave them for now as #2389 is going to tackle them.\nIf you do plan on using the code in there, `DirectoryGetFiles` and `DirectoryGetDirectories` both ignore the given path on WINDOWS_STOREAPP.\nIt looks like this bug was copy/pasted out of StorageDevice.\n(I'll send a PR to fix them when I get a chance.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2572/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2571","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2571/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2571/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2571/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2571","id":33763040,"number":2571,"title":"Use
