Note that there is also a [BlendFactor](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.xna.framework.graphics.blendstate.blendfactor.aspx) property variable in BlendState. I wrote a quick test to see how it works in XNA:\n\n```\n[Test]\npublic void BlendFactor()\n{\n    Assert.AreEqual(Color.White, gd.BlendFactor);\n\n    var blend = new BlendState\n    {\n        BlendFactor = Color.Crimson\n    };\n\n    gd.BlendState = blend;\n    Assert.AreEqual(Color.Crimson, gd.BlendFactor);\n\n    gd.BlendFactor = Color.CornflowerBlue;\n    Assert.AreEqual(Color.Crimson, gd.BlendState.BlendFactor);\n    Assert.AreEqual(Color.CornflowerBlue, gd.BlendFactor);\n\n    blend.Dispose();\n}\n```\n\nThis passes, so to get the same behavior in MG we just need to add a `public Color BlendFactor { get; set; }` and then in the BlendState setter set `BlendFactor = value.BlendFactor`. I don't know if this property should just override the BlendFactor from the BlendState, but my guess is that's how it works. XNA docs are ambiguous on this and just say both control blend factor...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5174","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5174/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5174/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5174/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5174","id":178414464,"number":5174,"title":"avoid the case where normalizing 0,0 results in NaN,NaN and instead default to 0,0","user":{"login":"prime31","id":60377,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/60377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prime31","html_url":"https://github.com/prime31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prime31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prime31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prime31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prime31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prime31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prime31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prime31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prime31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prime31/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-09-21T17:38:45Z","updated_at":"2016-09-21T18:30:50Z","closed_at":"2016-09-21T18:29:25Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/5174","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5174","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5174.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5174.patch"},"body":"minor fix for Vector2.Normalize to avoid it returning NaN,NaN when passed 0,0\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5173","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5173/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5173/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5173/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5173","id":177571384,"number":5173,"title":"[DX] Calling ApplyChanges() in Game actor cause Exception","user":{"login":"nkast","id":3018589,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3018589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast","html_url":"https://github.com/nkast","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-09-17T11:45:00Z","updated_at":"2017-06-22T17:18:32Z","closed_at":"2017-01-16T12:17:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Seen on W8.1 but probably also an issue on other Windows/DX. \r\n\r\nIf we call graphics.ApplyChanges() inside the Game constructor it has no effect on XNA and MG 3.5.

is no simple way, at least not one that I am aware of, to create a CI build for a UWP MonoGame project, for example.\nThe content pipeline requires a dependency to:\n`<Import Project=\"$(MSBuildExtensionsPath)\\MonoGame\\v3.0\\MonoGame.Content.Builder.targets\" />`\nwhich is fine on a developer machine, but the main issue is that MonoGame Installer(http://www.monogame.net/releases/v3.5.1/MonoGameSetup.exe) requires administrative credentials, and that's not allowed on a build machine that you don't have admin credentials, like VSTS's Hosted Build (https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/build/admin/agents/hosted-pool).\n\nThere should be a way to easily install all MonoGame Content Pipeline dependencies locally, or something else.\n\nIt's really bad to not be able to use this kind of setup.\n\nI already apologize if there is a way that I'm not aware of, but I tried several ways to do this and got into a dead end.\n\nMaybe we can have a \"portable\" ContentPipeline, maybe like a zipfile with all dependencies to MGCB.exe distributed as easily as we have the MonoGameSetup.exe, on a static URL at monogame.net website.\nAny
