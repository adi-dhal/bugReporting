We're not the only one to notice it was mentioned in this article too http://www.codemag.com/Article/1411081\n\nXInput is not a part of the default DirectX install so it doesn't ship with windows. You need to run the DirectX web installer to fix it http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35 (or install XNA which is why most of us never see the error). We did note that the windows store template does not suffer from this issue suggesting that the GamePad API is not wrapping XInput on windows store apps.\n\nSolution: The MonoGame installer should use DirectX setup to make sure that XInput1_3.dll (and any other optional DX components) are installed. \n\nOr maybe SharpDX needs to link to a later version?
