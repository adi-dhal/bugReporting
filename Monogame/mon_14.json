XNA when the window is being resized by the user the back buffer is not resized. The changes are only pushed through when the resizing ends. MonoGame currently also does that for DX for XNA conformance. We don't do that for DesktopGL because SDL does not have an event for user resizing ending. For DesktopGL the back buffer is resized every frame while the user is resizing. I don't have a clue what UWP does honestly.\r\n\r\nI opened this issue to propose the alternative to what XNA does. I.e. on all desktop platforms resize the back buffer every frame while the window is being resized. With current hardware this is really not an issue performance wise (which is maybe why XNA didn't do this). It looks neater (if handled correctly by the game dev, but they obviously should if they support resizing) and is easier to get working cross-platform in MonoGame itself.

The largest fix is that now the back buffer size is properly updated when switching to full screen. Other fixes include correctly switching from hardware to soft full screen and back, minimizing the window when the windows key is pressed only when in hard full screen mode and raising the ClientSizeChanged event when switching window state (e.g. minimizing the window).\r\n\r\nI also moved some responsibilities from WinFormsGamePlatform to WinFormsGameWindow because it made more sense there.\r\n\r\nAn issue that is not solved with this is changing the back buffer size while in hard full screen. That will not change the display mode while it should be able to do that. Can anyone more familiar with D3D pitch in? Do we just switch out of full screen and back in or is there a better way to do this?\r\n\r\nThere's another problem when creating a device in soft full screen (this didn't work before either). The back buffer size won't be right, which results in a blank screen (is that normal?). The cause of this problem is WinForms related. It seems the form ClientBounds are not updated immediately when changing the WindowState to Maximized when the form is not yet visible.\r\n\r\nfixes #5533 \r\nAlso fixes the DirectX issue from #5530.\r\n@aienabled, @Thraka","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5585/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5584","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5584/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5584/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5584/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5584","id":214224537,"number":5584,"title":"Remove Scale and Rotation properties from Matrix","user":{"login":"Jjagg","id":14875382,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/14875382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg","html_url":"https://github.com/Jjagg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jjagg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/11","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestone/11","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/11/labels","id":1647175,"number":11,"title":"3.7 Release","description":"","creator":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":91,"closed_issues":85,"state":"open","created_at":"2016-03-16T04:39:49Z","updated_at":"2017-10-04T20:19:23Z","due_on":"2017-06-06T07:00:00Z","closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-03-14T22:22:43Z","updated_at":"2017-03-15T02:17:03Z","closed_at":"2017-03-15T02:15:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/5584","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5584","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5584.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5584.patch"},"body":"See #5553 for discussion.

While Intel GPU, even 10 years old, mostly all supports Direct3D 10, they hardly have drivers for OpenGL 1.5 while they should be 3.0 capable, or at worst 2.1 (except on Linux where 2.1 is common place, because reasons).

That's a problem because on the same hardware, a Direct3D game could work while it's DesktopGL version wouldn't.\r\n\r\nI know that we can't support all hardware, but there's a relevant number of players to be miss for games which run only on SpriteBatch (particularly when considering emerging countries).\r\n\r\nHence, I'm wondering if we could think of a way to manage the loading of the OpenGL entry points differently, by ordering them by feature sets or GL versions, and trying to load their extensions equivalent if not found (like what's done for ARB_framebuffer_object), as well as not blocking the initialization on non-SpriteBatch critical functions.\r\n\r\n@Jjagg @cra0zy @dellis1972 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5580/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5579","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5579/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5579/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5579/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5579","id":213966276,"number":5579,"title":"Update to latest TargetPlatform enum","user":{"login":"vchelaru","id":729631,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/729631?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru","html_url":"https://github.com/vchelaru","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-03-14T04:32:05Z","updated_at":"2017-03-18T23:21:38Z","closed_at":"2017-03-18T23:21:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/5579","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5579","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5579.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5579.patch"},"body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5579/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5578","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5578/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5578/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5578/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5578","id":213919492,"number":5578,"title":"Shader works on all platforms except for UWP","user":{"login":"endimilojkoski","id":13436441,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13436441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/endimilojkoski","html_url":"https://github.com/endimilojkoski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/endimilojkoski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/endimilojkoski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/endimilojkoski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/endimilojkoski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/endimilojkoski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/endimilojkoski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/endimilojkoski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/endimilojkoski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/endimilojkoski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":15,"created_at":"2017-03-13T22:46:37Z","updated_at":"2017-03-14T17:32:11Z","closed_at":"2017-03-14T17:31:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have a simple screen shader that works on DesktopGL and Android but don't work on UWP (Windows 10 and Xbox One).\r\nI am attaching simple UWP project with the shader so anyone can take a look.
