If I changed the pixel shader to output a color instead of sampling the texture, I could see the primitives. I launched the graphics debugger, and indeed the result of sampling the texture was all zero. The device state looked correct, the texture was set in slot 0. The UV coordinates were also correct.\n\nHowever my shader code assigned register(t0) to the texture, but the shader assembly code used register t1... I will now try to assign textures using  the shader parameters instead of calling SetTexture on the device. Nevertheless, if I ask for register t0, I think the compiler should respect that.\n\nI am not sure where to start to fix this issue. I will try to make a small reproducible case.\n\nBut just to make sure, are there any known issues with UWP and Monogame regarding this? I tried the latest version of the framework and tools. I had to fix a couple of issues before it ran (multisampling was set to 32, and SV_Position was not matched to POSITION). After these fixes, my app started, but still no textures.\n\nThanks,\nPeter\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5230","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5230/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5230/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5230/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5230","id":183874007,"number":5230,"title":"Different behavior for RenderTarget on WindowsGL and Android when D24S8 set","user":{"login":"ThomasZeman","id":6089157,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6089157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasZeman","html_url":"https://github.com/ThomasZeman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasZeman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasZeman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasZeman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasZeman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasZeman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasZeman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasZeman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasZeman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasZeman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-10-19T06:12:12Z","updated_at":"2016-10-24T09:26:15Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\n\nThe following code behaves differently on WindowsGL Desktop and the Xamarin Android Emulator \"7inch KitKat (4.4) XHDPI Tablet (Android API 19)\".

So it was no longer possible to set a different fullscreen resolution.\n- If the window was minimised, the backbuffer was resized to 0x0.\n\nThe problem was that the `WinFormsGameWindow.OnClientSizeChanged` method was always resizing the backbuffer when the window size changed. This was regardless of whether or not fullscreen mode was enabled, or if the window was minimised.\n\nThis PR fixes this by simply skipping the backbuffer resize when fullscreen is enabled or if the window is minimised.\n\nAs a side effect of this, I've also cleaned up the `ClientSizeChanged` event. It was previously firing multiple times when switching to/from fullscreen mode. Now it only fires once (which is consistent with XNA behaviour).\n\nP.S. I think this _might_ also fix issue #5104, but I'm not sure.\n\nUPDATE: Confirmed to fix #5236\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5217","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5217/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5217/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5217/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5217","id":182046011,"number":5217,"title":"Missing
