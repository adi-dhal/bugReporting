After this change, objects are only added to the `GraphicsDevice._resources` list when their `GraphicsDevice` property is set.\n\nMost classes that derive from `GraphicsResource` set the `GraphicsDevice` in their constructor. So there's no actual change there. AFAIK, the only classes that do something different are the state classes - `BlendState`, `DepthStencilState`, `RasterizerState`, `SamplerState` - and `VertexDeclaration`. These classes have their `GraphicsDevice` properties set when they are first bound to a device. So they won't be added to the \"to dispose\" list until they are bound to a device - but I think that's fine, because there's also nothing to dispose of until they are bound to a device.\n\nIn the case of `VertexDeclaration`, it has a similar **potential** issue to the one I've just fixed for the static state objects. But I _think_ that's okay, because we don't actually create any device-specific objects in `VertexDeclaration` objects themselves, as far as I can tell.\n\nAnyway, it's enough of a change that I'd appreciate one or two people having a good look at this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3528/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3527","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3527/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3527/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3527/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3527","id":57600283,"number":3527,"title":"Catch

For reasons beyond my understanding and interest, `AbsorbQuitMessage` never got called previously with `MockGame`.\n- The `Vector2` tests compared the floating point values for equality, and that caused two test failures on XNA. I added a comparer based on existing bounding box comparer and updated the tests to use it where reasonable.\n\nWhile testing this, the test runner got stuck multiple times at [this line](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/Windows/WinFormsGameWindow.cs#L419). I am confident it is caused by the changes in #3474. The `PeekMessage` call intended to remove WM_QUIT messages could return, for example, WM_MOUSEMOVE messages (which is why reproducing this requires user interaction) and the 100ms wait only makes it more probable. Even more, thanks to the `do...while` loop behavior, this wait is guaranteed to happen at least once. As detailed [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/11/04/489028.aspx), WM_QUIT is not a posted but a generated message, so the loop as of now does not really help. Removing the WM_QUIT hack altogether seemed to work for me, but I did not include it here yet... I would like to have someone else test it too, in case I am mistaken.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3521","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3521/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3521/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3521/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3521","id":57456068,"number":3521,"title":"It would be great to have save as png working on windows dx as well.

Ideally merging in a platform like XB1, PS4, or WiiU would be as simple as copying a folder of files into the root of the public repo and executing Protobuild.\n\nAbout a year ago we took two big steps...\n## Moved to using Protobuild for project generation\n\nThe Protobuild change now means zero project file maintenance, new non-platform specific code is quick to add, and no more project file conflicts.  \n\nThe problem with Protobuild is that all the platform specific info is centralized in one file.  This means that if we have a closed source platform like we do with PS4... we have to maintain a patched version of that definition file with additional `.ps4.cs` files and other platform specific details.\n\nIdeally there should be a way to optionally include additional platform files/settings from the main Protobuild .definition file.  @hach-que ??\n## Partial classes and \"Platform\" methods\n\nAlso a lot of MonoGame platform code is now done with partial classes and \"Platform\" methods.  This is great as most of the platform code is just adding in various `.platform.cs` and editing the protobuild config file to include them.\n\nWe still have big classes like `GraphicsDeviceManager` that are a `#if` spaghetti.  We should prioritize converting classes like that into platform partial classes.\n\nIn places where we smaller `#if` blocks that are enabling some feature for multiple platforms we should look at add a feature specific `#if`.  For example this case here:\n\nhttps://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/Game.cs#L325\n\n... we probably need a `#if NO_EXIT` instead of naming specific platforms.  This allows the feature to be toggled on other platforms by changing the Protobuild config.\n## Extending The Pipeline\n\nA big area where we need to design a new abstraction is within the content pipeline.  There are cases where there are platform specific formats and processing that we want to be able to plug into the pipeline instead of being hard coded into the public repo.\n\nIn this case I started a separate issue for this (see https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/issues/2781) but it is something that needs consideration.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3514","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3514/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3514/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3514/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3514","id":57251919,"number":3514,"title":"Better OpenGL Efficiency","user":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":27755158,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/OpenGL","name":"OpenGL","color":"02e10c","default":false},{"id":28600960,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/Performance","name":"Performance","color":"02e10c","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/10","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestone/10","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/10/labels","id":1608521,"number":10,"title":"4.0 Release","description":"Major new API to support the new graphics libraries like Metal, Vulkan, and DirectX 12.\r\n","creator":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":6,"closed_issues":2,"state":"open","created_at":"2016-02-26T17:45:43Z","updated_at":"2017-03-09T08:24:50Z","due_on":"2016-09-06T07:00:00Z","closed_at":null},"comments":10,"created_at":"2015-02-10T23:03:55Z","updated_at":"2016-02-26T18:02:10Z","closed_at":"2016-02-26T18:02:10Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"This all stems from the following Khronos Group paper...\n\n  https://www.khronos.org/assets/uploads/developers/library/2014-gdc/Khronos-OpenGL-Efficiency-GDC-Mar14.pdf\n\nIs there any benefit to MonoGame to pursuing these approaches within the existing API?

help.\nGreg.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3507/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3506","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3506/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3506/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3506/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3506","id":56946858,"number":3506,"title":"New

Added `ContentTypeReader.CanDeserializeIntoExistingObject`, to match `ContentTypeWriter` and `ContentTypeSerializer` properties of the same name\n- Fixed a bug in `ContentCompiler.GetTypeWriter` if it was called multiple times for different closed generic types based on the same open generic type\n- Added support for polymorphic generic types in `IntermediateSerializer` - i.e. storing a `List<string>` in property of type `object`\n- Implemented \"proper\" check in `ReflectiveSerializer` for whether we can deserialize into an existing object, instead of basing it on being one of the `System.*` types - fixes 2nd issue in #3404 (note that this was already done properly in `ReflectiveWriter`, and in fact there would be some value in sharing some of the code to check whether properties can be serialized)\n- Used `property.GetIndexParameters()` in `ReflectiveReader` instead of the more complicated previous check\n- Added tests, or improved existing tests, for most of the above\n\nThese issues are fairly closely related, so hopefully it's okay bundling them into one PR. (Actually, the fix for the first problem uncovered another bug, and the fix for that uncovered a subsequent bug, etc.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3502","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3502/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3502/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3502/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3502","id":56880611,"number":3502,"title":"[Linux] Clicks shifted to the right","user":{"login":"WardBenjamin","id":4739008,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4739008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WardBenjamin","html_url":"https://github.com/WardBenjamin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WardBenjamin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WardBenjamin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WardBenjamin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WardBenjamin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WardBenjamin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WardBenjamin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WardBenjamin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WardBenjamin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WardBenjamin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2015-02-06T23:04:33Z","updated_at":"2017-04-30T01:57:50Z","closed_at":"2017-04-30T01:57:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Confirmed on Arch Linux: clicks seem to be all consistently shifted to the right of the screen.
