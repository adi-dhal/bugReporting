While this works it is inefficient because generally the code looks like this:\r\n```\r\nforeach (var e in myemitters)\r\n{\r\n    spriteBatch.Begin();\r\n    foreach (var p in e.particles)\r\n       spriteBatch.Draw(e.Texture, p.Position, e.SourceRect, p.Color, p.Rotation, GetOrigin(p), p.Scale, p.FlipEffects, p.Depth);\r\n    spriteBatch.End();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis is arguably the most expensive version of `Draw` and many redundant calculations occur for each draw.\r\n\r\nFor sure #5347 will help.\r\n\r\nAlso you could argue that people shouldn't do this... write your own rendering using a vb/drawprim that is customized to your particle system design.\r\n\r\nBut it made me think we could add some additional methods to `SpriteBatch` that help reduce redundancy when lots of related draws are made.  First and foremost when the texture/srcRect is shared which is common when you are drawing many instances of the same thing which happens a lot in games.\r\n\r\nOne approach would be to add a default texture and source rect to begin:\r\n```\r\nSpriteBatch.Begin(Texture2D, Rectangle, SpriteSortMode, BlendState, SamplerState, DepthStencilState, RasterizerState, Effect, Matrix);\r\n```\r\nMaybe a this begin call should have some alternate name.\r\n\r\nThen add additional draw methods that don't require any texture info and instead use the pre-calculated defaults.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5348/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5347","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5347/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5347/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5347/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5347","id":193018767,"number":5347,"title":"Specialize

@nkast has done some great work with his low level optimizations there is still more to be done.\r\n\r\nFor example all of these functions in `SpriteBatch`:\r\n```\r\nvoid Draw(Texture2D texture, Vector2 position, Color color);\r\nvoid Draw(Texture2D texture, Rectangle destinationRectangle, Color color);\r\nvoid Draw (Texture2D texture, Vector2 position, Rectangle? sourceRectangle, Color color);\r\nvoid Draw (Texture2D texture, Rectangle destinationRectangle, Rectangle? sourceRectangle, Color color);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll redirect to the same `DrawInternal` method which does a common set of optimizations.  We do this mainly to make the code easier to read and maintain as well as to void bugs.  This however comes at the expensive of performance.\r\n\r\nTake `void Draw(Texture2D texture, Vector2 position, Color color)` for example.  This draw doesn't need rotation, doesn't need flipping of sprites, doesn't need UV calculations.  If this function created its own `SpriteBatchItem` internally it could do so much more efficiently than `DrawInternal` does now.\r\n\r\nSame goes for the other specializations of `Draw` and `DrawFont` in `SpriteBatch`.  This matters when games are drawing 1000s for sprites per frame.\r\n\r\nWhile this does mean a lot more duplicate code... it also means much more performance.  We can deal with the issue of duplicate code via more unit tests.  Performance here is more important.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5347/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5346","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5346/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5346/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5346/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5346","id":192797394,"number":5346,"title":"SDL2
