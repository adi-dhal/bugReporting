I'm really unsure if this is a bug or me misusing something, but since it worked fine under 3.2 and fails in 3.3 now... My guess would be some different handling within the SpriteBatch class, but I have no idea of the actual Framework code at all.\n\nFirst of all: I'm using the \"Advanced Zima 2D Shadows\" (MonoGame version), compiled with the 3.3 Pipeline Tool on Windows and using the 3.2 assemblies of MonoGame (in my actual game) everything just worked fine:\n![tm_shader_working](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11522235/6690867/5137444e-ccc3-11e4-928f-1425daa8a052.png)\n\nNow I switched to the 3.3 assemblies and got this result (without any other changes):\n![tm_shader_failing](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11522235/6690878/654d230e-ccc3-11e4-9839-6db971301e4d.png)\n\nAfter some research I could narrow down the Problem to a 2x multi blend shader that doesn't seem to do it's job anymore.\n![tm_shader_failinginfo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11522235/6690899/7ec7a426-ccc3-11e4-9122-095c85eb1a25.png)\nAs you can see the lightmap is still being created correctly, but the blending part just blackens everything out (I used my main SpriteBatch to simply draw the lightmap instead of blending it with the underlying texture as done in the first picture). In the actual code there is a separate SpriteBatch set to use the multi blend shader to draw both textures.\nNote: The rocks around the player/placeholder changed since I restarted/rebuilt the game each time and therefore the map was randomly rebuilt each time.\n\nSince I'm quite confused now whether it's my bad or not I couldn't help myself besides posting this as an issue here. I am working on a Linux platform and even tried the WinGL assembly, but I still got this (unwanted) result.\n\nThe c# code where this issue occurs looks like this (completly from the shading system mentioned above):\n\n```\nthis.LightBlender.Parameters[\"MixFactor\"].SetValue(mixFactor0to1);\ngraphics.GraphicsDevice.SetRenderTarget(renderTarget);\nspriteBatch.Begin(SpriteSortMode.Immediate, BlendState.AlphaBlend, SamplerState.LinearClamp, null, RasterizerState.CullNone, this.LightBlender);\ngraphics.GraphicsDevice.Textures[1] = light;\ngraphics.GraphicsDevice.Textures[1].GraphicsDevice.SamplerStates[1] = SamplerState.LinearClamp;\nspriteBatch.Draw(underlyingTexture, Vector2.Zero, Color.White);\nspriteBatch.End();\n```\n\nSorry, if this is my issue and not yours, but I don't quite understand shaders yet and I didn't make any changes except the assembly-version I use (both are marked as 3.1.2.0 though).\nOh, while writing this I remembered: The \"old\" assembly was not the official 3.2 one. It was the one from the \"MonoDevelop Alpha Add-In Package\" (.mpack) that @cra0zy (or however his name is spelled, sorry) posted. I'm unsure which version this actually is since they are all marked as 3.1.2.0...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3618/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3617","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3617/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3617/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3617/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3617","id":62382678,"number":3617,"title":"Removed Old Content Pipeline","user":{"login":"cra0zy","id":6773302,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6773302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy","html_url":"https://github.com/cra0zy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-03-17T12:27:56Z","updated_at":"2015-03-18T19:31:21Z","closed_at":"2015-03-18T19:24:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/3617","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3617","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3617.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3617.patch"},"body":"MonoGame 3.3 got released so I really wanted to sync up dependencies.

it without setting a rendertarget.\nif i remove the lighting shader and not use rendertextyre2d the game works normally, but without all effects.\n\nIs this a known issue since i didn't find it
