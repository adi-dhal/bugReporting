overhauled the Guide for iOS 6+ Game Center functionality.\n#### Encapsulated repetitious code into single-purpose methods\n\nInstead of this type code being repeated all over the file:\n\n``` c#\nif (_window != null)\n{\n    if(viewController == null)\n    {\n        viewController = new GuideViewController(_gameViewController);\n        _window.Add(viewController.View);\n        viewController.View.Hidden = true;\n    }\n\n    prevGestures=TouchPanel.EnabledGestures;\n    TouchPanel.EnabledGestures=GestureType.None;\n    viewController.PresentModalViewController(leaderboardController, true);\n    IsVisible = true;\n}\n```\n\nEverything for showing and hiding Game Center view controllers is now encapsulated into two reusable and easily testable methods, which correctly handle the different modes of presenting/dismissing controllers for iOS 5 vs. iOS 6+:\n\n``` c#\nprivate static void ShowViewController(UIViewController viewController)\n{\n    // ...\n}\n\nprivate static void HideViewController(UIViewController viewController)\n{\n    // ...\n}\n```\n#### Fixed runtime warnings for Game Center in iOS 7\n\nUsing a separate `GuideViewController` as a parent for Game Center view controllers generates runtime warnings in iOS 7. The new \"correct\" way to open Game Center view controllers (for iOS 6+) is to simply open them with the root view controller (as seen in the new `ShowViewController` method mentioned above).\n#### iOS 6+ no longer uses deprecated methods to open Game Center windows\n\nInstead of using the deprecated `GKLeaderboardViewController` and `GKAchievementViewController`, iOS 6+ now uses the new `GKGameCenterViewController` for showing leaderboards and achievements. As with everything else, the old methods are still in place for iOS 5 and older. Related note: All compiler warnings in Guide.cs have been fixed.\n#### Fixed a MatchMaker crash bug\n\nSetting playersToInvite to null caused the game to crash, so now we pass in an empty array instead which seems to work well (tested on iOS 5+).\n#### Fixed the file formatting\n\nTabs, spaces, braces in Guide.cs have been fixed to be in line with MonoGame's coding conventions.\n#### Bonus feature: Twitter\n\nAdded access to iOS's Twitter API in the Guide now too.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2503","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2503/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2503/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2503/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2503","id":33145786,"number":2503,"title":"Remove AccelerometerCapabilities, AccelerometerState.

PSM being the only exceptions)\n- Reduces the platform DLL's down to just those classes that are platform dependant\n\nOver time though the use of the \"helpers\" more classes could be moved to the

The game does not crash, but freezes. The stack is more or less, this:\n\nGL.CompileShader (_shaderHandle)\nvertexShader.GetShaderHandle (first time, before the first GL.AttachShader\nShaderProgramCache.Link\n_programCache.GetProgramInfo\nActivateShaderProgram\nPlatformApplyState\nPlatformDrawPrimitives\nGraphicsDevice.DrawPrimitives\n\nthere are no aparent errors related to this problem in the log. \n\nIt's not a random issue, every time the program hits that section, it's a freeze. The game apparently works  well on most devices.\n\nI'm using BasicEffect in other places before the crash. (isn't it weird that it has to be compiled more than one time?)\n\nAny ideas?\nThanks!\nKak\n\nEDIT: Wow, I just randomly found that the game does not crash, but it takes an insane amount of time (varies between 20 and 30 seconds) to execute GL.CompileShader. Game runs well afterwards. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2496/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2495","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2495/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2495/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2495/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2495","id":33056326,"number":2495,"title":"Fullscreen is not switchable.","user":{"login":"Chaosus","id":3036176,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3036176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus","html_url":"https://github.com/Chaosus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":42,"created_at":"2014-05-08T05:50:45Z","updated_at":"2015-07-23T17:06:55Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think this issue is important and must be fixed in next release.

I'll leave Linux and OSX for people that can properly build and test against it.\n\nAt the moment, the Texture Importer/Processors and a couple of other related classes (Such as fonts) are implemented System.Drawing.Bitmap. In order to quickly add this feature and preserve functionality, we're using FreeImage to import the image, then passing a System.Drawing.Bitmap through the system.
