I don't use MonoGame pipeline and load all the assets in runtime from their source files. So I'm using these constructors for `SoundEffect` (accepting PCM wave data):\r\n```C#\r\nSoundEffect(byte[] buffer, int sampleRate, AudioChannels channels)\r\nSoundEffect(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count, int sampleRate, AudioChannels channels, int loopStart, int loopLength)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I've found two issues with the first method (the second method works fine):\r\n1. The sound played much longer than specified, and during the added duration it produces various noise.\r\n2. With some specific effect duration I have a native crash when try to play the sound.\r\n\r\nI've created a sample game reproducing the issue. It's very simple - it creates the sine wave (as float[] samples array) and then convert it to the byte array (PCM wave format).\r\nOn mouse left button click it plays the sound and writes to the output log (VS output log) how long it was playing: `Sound played duration: 1366.7ms - vs - sound effect duration 680.0ms` (in case of the first method, in case of the second method it's exactly as it should be (if the sample count matches frame rate).\r\nAlso there is a line to uncomment `//var samplesCount = 44100;` to test the native crash issue.\r\n\r\nYou can get the sample game code there https://gist.github.com/aienabled/e0589a23edcb933fba2277c5152041e9 (just create a new MonoGame DX project and replace `Game1.cs` with this

Currently the build bot is on stable (4.6.2) and there is a hard dependency somewhere (i've not found it yet) on that mono. So the easiest solution for now is the use a symlink. \r\nOnce we upgrade the build bot to 4.8.0 (when it goes stable) we will need to revisit this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5456","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5456/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5456/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5456/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5456","id":205152061,"number":5456,"title":"SpriteBatch Begin/End.
