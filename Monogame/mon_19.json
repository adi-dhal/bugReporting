I recently ported an XNA project that utilizes 3D graphics.  Under XNA it was using the HiDef profile.\r\n\r\nUsing MonoGame 3.5.1 the performance was indistinguishable from XNA, but there was a bug using the Xbox One controller.  If it was plugged in when the game was launched, it didn't work until it was unplugged, then reconnected.\r\n\r\nI decided to try using the latest dev build to see if that bug was fixed.  I grabbed it as of a few weeks ago, version 3.6.0.1365.  At first, it didn't run at all...there were some minor changes I had to make, but the biggest issue was an error telling me I had to use 16-bit indices rather than 32-bit indices.  Huh?  I ultimately realized that it was trying to force the Reach profile, and fixed it by adding the following line in my constructor:\r\n\r\ngraphics.GraphicsProfile = GraphicsProfile.HiDef;\r\n\r\nwhere \"graphics\" is my GraphicsDeviceManager.  This got the game running, and the controller detection bug had indeed been fixed in the new MonoGame build, but the framerate was approximately half of what it had been before.  The game looked identical, but the performance had dropped like a rock.\r\n\r\nI was hoping that this was just a temporary bug.  I tried again with version 3.6.0.1425 just a few days ago (which is still the current version as of 1/29/2017).  But now the game won't start at all.  It builds OK, but crashes during initialization with a Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.NoSuitableGraphicsDeviceException.\r\n\r\nI am using a 2010 MacBook sporting an integrated GeForce 320M GPU.  Yeah, an antique by today's standards, but it always ran my XNA stuff quite easily.  \r\n\r\nWere the hardware requirements just raised?  If so, why?  If not, what could be causing this?\r\n\r\nIf there's no easy fix for this (and the performance issues), is it possible for me to Frankenstein the new Input code into MonoGame 3.5.1 and use that instead, for its superior performance?\r\n\r\nThanks very much for your assistance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5449/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5448","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5448/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5448/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5448/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5448","id":204182354,"number":5448,"title":"Reverted

Local graphics testing time went from ~37 seconds to ~7.\r\n\r\nHere are the local run times in this branch as reported by ReSharpers unit test runner:\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14875382/21983857/834ca88e-dbf3-11e6-94dd-e212873949aa.png)\r\n\r\nThe stuff that still takes long is:\r\n\r\n1. Audio conversion tests take about 7 seconds. We can probably cut down on the used audio duration a bit if we want to improve here. There are 3 audio files used, one of about 1 second and the other two of 7 seconds.\r\n2. Compiling the stock effects takes about 10 seconds. Not sure if it's D3DCompiler or our code, this could be looked at for better performance.\r\n3. IntermediateDeserializer takes some time because of IO I guess. Not much to do here.\r\n4. The framework tests take over 3 seconds because of 1 leftover test that actually creates a window and runs a game. If not for that the Framework tests would take less than a second.\r\n5. Some Graphics test still need to create a new device or reset the existing one (in GraphicsDeviceTest and GraphicsDeviceManagerTest), that takes a bit of time but is required for proper testing. One thing we could do to speed up graphics tests is run the frame comparison in parallel (not across tests, but for a single test or even a single frame). It shouldn't be too hard to try that out, so I might give that a shot.\r\n6. There's one other test under Visual/Misc that creates a window and runs a game. I have a plan for adding a setting to run MG headless in Game if that's acceptable. That would fix this and 4. and will allow for testing Game more easily in the future. Could also be nice for users (http://community.monogame.net/t/headless-monogame/7063).\r\n7. DynamicSoundEffectInstance does some sleeping to wait for soundeffects to finish/progress. it looks like this can be cut down on a little bit by reducing soundeffect duration.\r\n\r\nSo there's still some optimization that can be done probably.\r\n\r\nWhile persisting the GraphicsDevice across tests gives a significant performance boost there is a small downside too. There is no way to reset the bound shaders and constantbuffers through the api. Tests that depend on shaders not being bound will need to call HardReset first. That disposes the current device and creates a new one. For other tests a SoftReset (called automatically) seems to suffice. I made the GraphicsDeviceSetUpFixture flag a device reset so it knows to do a hard reset after the test so no big changes are persisted (like changing the GraphicsProfile). \r\n\r\nWe're not using 'fresh' GraphicsDevice every test in this branch, but everything is reset properly so I don't think there are risks of mistesting with these changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4905","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507242346","x-github-request-id":"AB12:572C:1566B63:2A817EE:59D6A691","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=20>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=200>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=18>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"8440a9c61f3e05ac541b62f85a166f99\"","status":"200 OK"}}
