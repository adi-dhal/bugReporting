I found a few methods/properties missing here and there which I will send a pull-request for when done.\n\nBut the main issue right now I am having is the fact that the VideoPlayer implementation differs from the MS Documentation..  the Documentation states that the constructor takes no arguments, yet MonoGame's takes a single arg of a Game instance.\n\nIt looks like the primary reason it does this is ONLY to acquire access to the GraphicsDevice and Window objects.. So, my question is, how can this be refactored to NOT require passing the Game instance to the VideoPlayer constructor??\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/79/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/78","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/78/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/78/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/78/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/78","id":2155515,"number":78,"title":"Multiple fixes for Mac full screen toggle and cursor state ","user":{"login":"kjpou1","id":640466,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/640466?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjpou1","html_url":"https://github.com/kjpou1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjpou1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjpou1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjpou1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjpou1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjpou1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjpou1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjpou1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjpou1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjpou1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2011-11-06T09:49:18Z","updated_at":"2014-07-11T14:05:54Z","closed_at":"2011-11-06T09:53:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/78","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/78","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/78.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/78.patch"},"body":"Also includes a fix for TargetElapsedTime that was not implemented\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/78/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/77","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/77/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/77/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/77/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/77","id":2155094,"number":77,"title":"FlatRedBall Changes","user":{"login":"sdancer","id":1099520,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1099520?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdancer","html_url":"https://github.com/sdancer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdancer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdancer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdancer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdancer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdancer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdancer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdancer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdancer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdancer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2011-11-06T05:42:31Z","updated_at":"2014-07-11T14:06:24Z","closed_at":"2011-11-06T09:46:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/77","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/77","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/77.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/77.patch"},"body":"Implementations for DrawUserPrimitives and DrawIndexedUserPrimitives (though this one is not tested).  \n\nUpdates to BasicEffect and Texture2D to apply states before rendering.  \n\nA couple of properties changed to be syntactically correct.
