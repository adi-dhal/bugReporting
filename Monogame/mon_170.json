see, the vec4 parameter array is sized 10 , when it should be 12 (3 matrices x 4 rows each). Looks like the compiler is optimizing the parameters, since the WorldNormal casts the matrix to a 3x3 float ( XNA didn't allow float3x3 parameters, if I remember well)). I suppose the same thing happens for WorldPosition.\n\nThis sounds great, but it breaks when the shader is applied, as it tries to apply effect parameters with wrong sizes in ConstantBuffer.\n\nIn this case, the offsets are ok ( 0, 64 and 112), but the amount of data copied isn't ( it tries to copy 64 bytes the three times ).\n\nI'm not sure as to how to fix this, I suppose you should store the parameter size in the MGFX, or calculate it using the offset for the next parameter, instead of supposing it's always 64 bytes for 4x4 matrices).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/911/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/910","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/910/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/910/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/910/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/910","id":7931739,"number":910,"title":"[iOS] Handle is not allocated exception","user":{"login":"Nezz","id":431167,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/431167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz","html_url":"https://github.com/Nezz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2012-10-29T10:48:10Z","updated_at":"2012-11-20T00:12:57Z","closed_at":"2012-11-20T00:12:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I receive the following exception when the finalizer of RenderTarget is called:\n\n```\n{System.InvalidOperationException: Handle is not allocated\nat System.Runtime.InteropServices.GCHandle.get_Target () [0x0001b] in /Developer/MonoTouch/Source/mono/mcs/class/corlib/System.Runtime.InteropServices/GCHandle.cs:80\nat System.WeakReference.get_Target () [0x00000] in /Developer/MonoTouch/Source/mono/mcs/class/corlib/System/WeakReference.cs:95\nat System.WeakReference.get_IsAlive () [0x00000] in /Developer/MonoTouch/Source/mono/mcs/class/corlib/System/WeakReference.cs:88\nat Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.GraphicsResource.get_GraphicsDevice () [0x00000] in /Users/turtlegames/Documents/Development/MonoDevelop/ui/MonoGame/MonoGame.Framework/Graphics/GraphicsResource.cs:157\nat Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.RenderTarget2D.Dispose (Boolean disposing) [0x0000b] in /Users/turtlegames/Documents/Development/MonoDevelop/ui/MonoGame/MonoGame.Framework/Graphics/RenderTarget2D.cs:184\nat Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.GraphicsResource.Finalize () [0x00000] in /Users/turtlegames/Documents/Development/MonoDevelop/ui/MonoGame/MonoGame.Framework/Graphics/GraphicsResource.cs:74 }\n```\n\nThe rendertarget's dispose is called, which checks for the GraphicsDevice.

Allows Dispose() to be called multiple times. Dispose() suppresses the finalizer.  Finalizer calls Dispose() if the developer forgets.\n- Fixes GL object disposal so it copes with the GL context going away, the GraphicsDevice being disposed, and disposal on a worker thread.  Dispatches the disposal work to the UI thread, which is then performed during GraphicsDevice.Present().\n- Ensure GraphicsDevice.Present() is called consistently amongst platforms.\n- Game.EndDraw() now calls Platform.Present().\n- Game now disposes Content and GraphicsDeviceManager.\n- GraphicsResource.GraphicsDevice is now a WeakReference internally to cope with the GraphicsDevice being garbage collected out of order at shutdown.\n- GraphicsResource-derived classes no longer add an event handler to GraphicsDevice.DeviceResetting.  This eliminates a strong reference that was preventing objects from being garbage collected.  Functionality is replaced with the global list of GraphicsResource objects and GraphicsResource.DoGraphicsDeviceResetting().\n- There may be some other small fixes in there that I have omitted to mention.\n\nTested on Windows and Android.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/905/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/904","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/904/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/904/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/904/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/904","id":7827701,"number":904,"title":"Fix
