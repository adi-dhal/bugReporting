But with this new change, at a scale of 8, the mouse suddenly becomes visible when I move it to the left edge of the screen, and if I click there, the full-screen window is minimized to show whatever other program I have open. And the smaller the resolution scale, the higher the percentage of area of the game buffer that will inexplicably show the mouse.\r\n\r\nAnd, for the icing on the cake, my computer threw up a blue error screen and restarted not once, but _twice_ while running the program.\r\n\r\nI uninstalled the newly installed version of MonoGame, downloaded the 3.6 stable build instead, and installed that. With the stable 3.6 build, the second code example works exactly as expected, with no issues. The first example results in the image being stretched to fit the whole screen instead of remaining at a 4:3 aspect ratio. Neither example exhibits the strange mouse bug when using the stable 3.6 build.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5928/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5927","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5927/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5927/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5927/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5927","id":255985048,"number":5927,"title":"Types in OpenGL and OpenAL namespaces now internal","user":{"login":"KonajuGames","id":694943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/694943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames","html_url":"https://github.com/KonajuGames","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-09-07T15:48:53Z","updated_at":"2017-09-08T03:33:29Z","closed_at":"2017-09-08T03:33:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/5927","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5927","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5927.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5927.patch"},"body":"OpenGL namespace renamed to MonoGame.OpenGL.

However, this does not work correctly with immersive mode - when the system changes to immersive mode, this callback is not called and the client bounds do not update. This causes the render target to be cropped and drawn several pixels below the top of the screen, at least until the screen rotates again and we have the correct sizes.\r\n\r\nIs there any other, more reliable way to get this information, or is the `GameWindow` the correct way to do it?
