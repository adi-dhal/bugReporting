Some pixels rendered differently which started making me worry. (the game is completely 2D).\n\nIt seems like if I try to stretch out 1 pixel from a spritesheet and draw it beyond a certain x width/y height, there are a row of pixels that are not drawn and are left out even though the rectangle bounds specified are supposed to cover this left out area. However this does not happen on my desktop which is why it confuses me.\n\nI begin drawing with:\n\nengine.spriteBatch.Begin(SpriteSortMode.Deferred, null, SamplerState.PointClamp, null, null);\n\nSome example of code which creates the issue:\n\nengine.spriteBatch.Draw(engine.textures.interfaceWindow, new Rectangle(0, 0, engine.display.width, engine.display.height), new Rectangle(16, 49, 1, 1), Color.White, 0f, Vector2.Zero, SpriteEffects.None, 0f);\n- engine.textures.interfaceWindow - is just the basic texture\n- new Rectangle(0, 0, engine.display.width, engine.display.height) - creates the target bounds to draw to be the whole window\n- new Rectangle(16, 49, 1, 1) - only gets one source pixel from the interfaceWindow spritesheet (this is just the back color of a window, using it in this way just for the example).\n\nOn my desktop, the above code colors the whole screen correctly with one color. On my laptop, it will draw over almost all of the screen but the right and bottom edges, the edges are not touched and nothing is drawn (there is a white outline 1 pixel in width at the edges of the rendering scene). This small \"untouched\" gap gets larger the bigger I make the target rectangle.\n\nImages:\nOn my desktop:\n![hmmm2](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/3013922/445288/a24493c8-b1b8-11e2-9a6e-15ebe55fc0f3.png)\n\nOn my laptop:\n![hmmm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/3013922/445304/07632d14-b1b9-11e2-9c56-6396ab8d5d7a.png)\n\nThats just the top right of the window, the bottom of the window also has the white line. Also notice that the \"untouched\" gap there is larger than 1 pixel, this is because I had a large render width, making the target Rectangle's width larger.\n\nI had trouble explaining this, I thoroughly looked at my code and I just cannot see how this can be a problem I am making myself.\n\nI'm about to go to sleep so I may not reply for some time, thanks for reading.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1696/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1695","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1695/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1695/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1695/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1695","id":13747543,"number":1695,"title":"Added missing Content folder to newest windows platforms.","user":{"login":"Chaosus","id":3036176,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3036176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus","html_url":"https://github.com/Chaosus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-04-29T06:28:18Z","updated_at":"2014-07-11T04:17:37Z","closed_at":"2013-05-01T12:46:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/1695","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1695","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1695.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1695.patch"},"body":"Miss Content folder when creating project on newest windows platforms (win8,win8 xaml,windows phone)?

I step through I note that the \"version\" that comes out of the BinaryReader is version 3 and the reader checks this version against a preset value which is 5.\n\nSo the incompatibility is obvious from a code example.\n\nWhat i'm wondering is why and how to resolve this, guessing there is something in the effect file and the way it's compiled is wrong???\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1677/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1676","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1676/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1676/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1676/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1676","id":13457424,"number":1676,"title":"Windows

sure if this is worth looking at but probably more problematic for new devs looking into Monogame.\n\nNone of the starter kits function for one of the two reasons below\n- They rely on Texture2D.FromStream which in directX throws a \"Not Implemented\" exception\n- Missing references to \"AudioEngine\", \"Cue\", \"Soundbank\", \"WaveBank\"\n\nI suspect the above is probably the projects not being updated with recent changes but without altering default exceptions in VS, they won't even tell you this and just crash.\n\nSimilar issues exist with the Samples for Windows as you cannot even open the Windows Solution as it complains that the particle project isn't supported (in both VS2010 / VS2012)  and numerous other build errors.\n\nThese either need fixing or replacing going forward in line with @CartBlanche 's suggestion of new samples.\n\nFor the newbie it doesn't look especially good in the repo right now.
