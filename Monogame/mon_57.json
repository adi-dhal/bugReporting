it be possible to implement move and resize events for the main game as currently there is no way of identifying the position or size of the window. I have seen you push this away before putting the user at fault due to design issues however I can't see how I would get it to work without.\nBasically I am trying to make a border-less desktop window that you can resize and position to your liking. I would then be using the SwapChainRenderTarget to have multiple windows displayed in parallel with the initial game window. I would finally need to track the position of the central window as then I could have it manage all user input without having to push input events from other window hosts and all I would have to check is if any window I own has focus. This would work fine as monogame isn't concerned about focus so assuming I can position the windows internally for input handling all should be good.\nKind Regards,\nAndy A\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4301/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4300","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4300/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4300/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4300/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4300","id":120810563,"number":4300,"title":"EffectParameter Additions / Completion","user":{"login":"mattleibow","id":1096616,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1096616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattleibow","html_url":"https://github.com/mattleibow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattleibow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattleibow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattleibow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattleibow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattleibow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattleibow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattleibow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattleibow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattleibow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-12-07T16:24:15Z","updated_at":"2016-02-23T02:03:51Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/4300","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4300","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4300.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4300.patch"},"body":"I have added some changes to the `GetValue` methods to bring them up to the features of XNA.

However, after redirecting users to the mentioned update, nothing changes and most users report that the update won't even install.\n\nAt first I thought it was related to #4176 but I can confirm it isn't.\n\nThe problem seems very rare, given that Vista users are now very few. There are merely a couple referenced occurrences of that problem on the internet.\n\nMy best guess would be that the current version of SharpDX targets a Media Foundation version incompatible with Windows Vista.\n\nThis problem, added to #4176 and the recent difficulties to rework DirectX `Song` playback make me wonder if it would be interesting to switch to another API, at least for the Windows Desktop platform (the other Windows platforms are most probably not affected by Media Foundation

audio system stays active on Android devices and continues to drain battery when Monogame apps are in inactive in the background. This has been documented here:\n\nhttp://community.monogame.net/t/mg-android-game-keeps-draining-battery-life-in-background/2664\n\nand here:\n\nMonogame Issue https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/issues/3899\n\nWe wanted to post a $1,000 USD bounty for the successful resolution of this issue and it's acceptance into the Monogame develop branch. It looks like there are two viable solutions, one is to compile a new openal-soft library and use the new functions to pause suspend/pause the device when necessary. Another would be a fully managed mixer. Either way, this is a big blocker for anyone pushing games to production on Android, and we hope for a final solution soon

PR addresses multiple issues at once because they're all dependent on one another:\n- **Upgrades Protobuild:** Throughout the course of this PR I had to make changes to Protobuild to support the newer APIs and fix various issues across platforms, so that is updated here.\n- **Remove old XSLTs:** With the Windows Universal and tvOS platforms upstreamed into Protobuild, there's no need for MonoGame to keep it's own copies of the XSLT files any more.  This PR removes them in favour of the built-in ones.  This will assist with #4218.\n- **Mac now supports the Xamarin.Mac Unified API:** It supports both the MonoMac API, XamMac API and newer Xamarin.Mac API (unified).  The older APIs are supported by #ifdef'ing namespaces with the `PLATFORM_MACOS_LEGACY` define.  This resolves #4275, but should also fix bugs like #4278.\n- **WindowsUAP is now WindowsUniversal:** This brings the MonoGame platform name inline with the platform name being used in upstream.  See https://github.com/hach-que/Protobuild/pull/130 for the name change reasoning.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4281","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4281/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4281/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4281/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4281","id":119677800,"number":4281,"title":"Touch broken with Windows 10 Mobile build 10586","user":{"login":"Nezz","id":431167,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/431167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz","html_url":"https://github.com/Nezz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nezz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2015-12-01T09:40:01Z","updated_at":"2015-12-01T19:48:14Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Tested using the new emulator from yesterday and actual device too\nWorks fine on non-mobile\n@tomspilman Have you encountered this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4280","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4280/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4280/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4280/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4280","id":119664203,"number":4280,"title":"Fix LerpPrecise to return float instead of object","user":{"login":"ala53","id":8086191,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8086191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala53","html_url":"https://github.com/ala53","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala53/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala53/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala53/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala53/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala53/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala53/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala53/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala53/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala53/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-12-01T08:11:29Z","updated_at":"2015-12-07T22:43:11Z","closed_at":"2015-12-07T22:43:11Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/4280","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4280","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4280.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4280.patch"},"body":"In reference to #4279.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4867","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507242346","x-github-request-id":"9726:572C:156B6DB:2A8B30B:59D6A723","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=58>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=200>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1579990/issues?state=all&page=56>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"c71f627546e9cc8de7fbb1cf4720a6fb\"","status":"200 OK"}}
