In my scenario, and in the referenced repro app, a pinch gesture using 4 or more fingers has the effect of showing a toolbox above the monogame surface. (A xaml control is faded in on top of it).\n\nPinching together with 4 or 5 fingers shows the xaml control. Pinching apart makes it disappear. You can visually see this happen. The game surface is black, the xaml control is white.\n\nIt doesn't happen upon demand, however if you keep pinching and reverse pinching in distinct gestures eventually gesture will stop registering position changes. Additionally PinchComplete is never triggered again.\n\nPasted below is some debug output that my sample writes. As you can see, it got into a state where the same values for pinch gesture keeps repeating.\n\nDownload the example from here: http://sdrv.ms/1bQkJPx\n\n--- Debug.Writeline of gesture values ---\nPosition -

I found that I could repeat this problem 100% of the time whenever EnabledGestures changed and the IsEnabledGesture is subsequently called.  The easiest way to repeat this is to (A) remove the patch that I put in the code to mask this problem, and (B) keep tapping on the screen once you have cleared all UFOs from it and are waiting for the next level to begin.\n\nIn the debugger I have seen that IsGestureAvailable's \"while (_gestureEvents.Count > 0)\" loop goes infinite because abandoned _gestureEvents get stuck in it.\n\nSomewhere in TouchPanel these stale _gestureEvents must be removed from the list to prevent an infinite-loop from occurring.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2076/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2075","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2075/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2075/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2075/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2075","id":20879675,"number":2075,"title":"Can't MediaPlayer.Stop User's Music to Play Game Music","user":{"login":"dancolasanti","id":2036149,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2036149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dancolasanti","html_url":"https://github.com/dancolasanti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dancolasanti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dancolasanti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dancolasanti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dancolasanti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dancolasanti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dancolasanti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dancolasanti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dancolasanti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dancolasanti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2013-10-11T16:38:17Z","updated_at":"2014-09-10T02:42:56Z","closed_at":"2014-09-10T02:42:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"On WP8 there is a requirement that if the user is currently playing Music when a game is started, the game must ask the user if it's OK to stop their music in order for the game to play its own music (for example, a background music track played by the MediaPlayer).  \n\nUnfortunately, the same code used in XNA on WP7/WP8 to stop the user's music isn't working in MonoGame - it has no effect.
