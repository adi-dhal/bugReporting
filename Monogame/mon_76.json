The first frame after changing resolution is wrong because the swapchain/Window size doesn't sync with Present. I think we have to record a size change and wait until next Present() to apply it. Probably also separate execution paths that end up to CreateSizeDependentResources based on whether the change comes from a rotation (external) or from the code (internal).\nThe following code swaps between 1 & 1/2 scale every frame.\n\n> ```\n>        f = (f+1)%2;\n>        float scale = (f + 1f) / 1f; // swap between x1.0 or x0.5\n>        graphics.PreferredBackBufferWidth = (int)(Window.ClientBounds.Width * scale);\n>        graphics.PreferredBackBufferHeight = (int)(Window.ClientBounds.Height * scale);\n>        graphics.ApplyChanges();\n> ```\n\nThe first screenshot is half the size while it should scale up and fill the window and look  low res.\nThe opposite is also true, if you start with x0.5 scale and change to x1 the next frame is the upper-left 1/4 of your game zoomed in.\nThe second screenshot is Photoshoped to show how the game looks like, in realilty there is flicker.\n\n![scaletohalf](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3018589/7123997/ba86adf6-e22e-11e4-812d-0ff77ee67545.jpg)\n![psed](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3018589/7124221/0b56f5e6-e230-11e4-9365-bf7ac2f2d13e.jpg)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3729/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3728","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3728/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3728/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3728/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3728","id":68167849,"number":3728,"title":"[Pipeline]
