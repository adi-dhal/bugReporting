As I understand it, `vertexStride` controls the padding left between source data elements when they are copied to the vertex buffer. It must be `>= sizeof(T)`.\n\nIn my opinion, that means it's a somewhat poor choice of name, because if you're passing in a `byte[]`, the value you would choose for `vertexStride` (probably `1`) doesn't really have anything to do with vertex stride. But that's for another time.\n\nI'm sorry for introducing this bug; I'll try to do more testing next time. If you spot anything amiss in this PR, let me know and I'll fix it ASAP.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: @tomspilman , if you want the tests to actually run under XNA, you'll need to change the `RunOneFrame` calls to `Game.Run()`, as per our previous discussion. (I'm not sure why you don't want to use `Game.Run()`, since it has the same effect of running one frame and then exiting. In XNA, `RunOneFrame` seems to assume that the game has already been initialized, which MonoGame does at the start of `RunOneFrame`, but XNA (apparently) doesn't. So it might be non-trivial to get it working in the XNA tests. But that's a separate issue.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3377","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3377/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3377/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3377/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3377","id":53883392,"number":3377,"title":"Implement IntermediateSerializer.Serialize","user":{"login":"tgjones","id":102049,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/102049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones","html_url":"https://github.com/tgjones","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2015-01-09T16:07:09Z","updated_at":"2015-01-12T12:34:08Z","closed_at":"2015-01-11T21:51:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/3377","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3377","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3377.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3377.patch"},"body":"and supporting code, including `IntermediateWriter` and `ReflectiveSerializer.Serialize`.\n\nRelated to #2621.\n\nI made some changes to the existing XML test files, for two reasons:\n- To make them round-trippable, and\n- To remove namespace alias usage from most test files, except for the one specifically related to namespaces\n\nThe code should be mostly okay, but `IntermediateSerializer.WriteNamespaces` could do with some cleaning up.

is a suggestion for MGCB and the Pipeline Tool to allow content to be built using simple wildcard patterns with only the *, **, and ? characters as used with [MSBuild](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms171453.aspx#BKMK_Wildcards)\n\nI found the way I had to manage files and their options to be a bit cumbersome in the pipeline tool. This is not something one does often, but I think things could be made easier for many people if they could just set up their build settings based on patterns rather than requiring a normal file path. A simple example:\n\n```\n/importer:AnimationImporter\n/processor:SpecialAnimationProcessor\n/build:Content/**/*_S.rani\n\n/importer:AnimationImporter\n/processor:PassThroughProcessor\n/build:Content/**/*.rani\n\n/copy:Content/**/*.rdec\n\n/importer:TextureImporter\n/processor:TextureProcessor\n/processorParam:ColorKeyColor=255,0,255,255\n/processorParam:ColorKeyEnabled=True\n/processorParam:GenerateMipmaps=False\n/processorParam:PremultiplyAlpha=True\n/processorParam:ResizeToPowerOfTwo=False\n/processorParam:TextureFormat=Color\n/build:Content/**/*.png\n```\n\nThis could be presented in the GUI as a special type of item, named as the pattern, that can only be added under the root but is otherwise configured like any other file.\n\nCombining this with a post-build event in visual studio means that content can be added to and built from visual studio without needing to work with a separate build tool GUI in most cases.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3368","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3368/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3368/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3368/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3368","id":53626874,"number":3368,"title":"Rectangle

It _sometimes_ works, but other times, if you leave the mouse stationary, it still thinks the mouse is moving by 1 pixel in the X or Y direction.\n\nI've tracked the problem down to DPI scaling. If I set my DPI scaling to 100%, there's no problem. But with 150% scaling, there seems to be a problem with mouse position getting rounded. I haven't looked into it yet, but I guess that somewhere between setting the mouse position and retrieving it, there's a float getting rounded to an int, or something, which means MonoGame constantly thinks that the mouse has moved by a little bit, even if it hasn't.\n\nI'll work on a pull request for this, but I wanted to raise this issue first in case anyone else has experienced this issue.
