the mouse leaves the window on a MonoGame Windows Project it looks like the mouse doesn't get updated (except for the scroll wheel).\n\nIt seems when you scroll up or down when the mouse is outside the window that the mouse does get updated on a MonoGame Windows Project.\n\nThis is my code for testing, i do everything in the Draw method for easy testing.\n\n```\nprotected override void Draw(GameTime gameTime)\n        {\n            GraphicsDevice.Clear(Color.CornflowerBlue);\n\n\n            MouseState state = Mouse.GetState();\n\n            string testString = \"Mouse Position:

window even closes when I press the middle button on my mouse.\n\nI also tried it on a MonoGame Windows OpenGL Project and it seems that the mouse gets updated outside the window but when I press the middle button on my mouse the window just loses focus and it doesn't close like on Xna 4.0.\nOn a MonoGame Windows Project the window also loses focus and doesn't close.\n\nI hope this helps and

did!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2748/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2747","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2747/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2747/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2747/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2747","id":36484480,"number":2747,"title":"SoundBank

But if you are porting a game from XNA to MonoGame and depend on `SpriteFont.MeasureString()`, then you will get lots of misaligned text.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2740","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2740/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2740/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2740/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2740","id":36368757,"number":2740,"title":"Android crash (apparently not very important)","user":{"login":"KakCAT","id":2372854,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2372854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT","html_url":"https://github.com/KakCAT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-06-24T09:49:45Z","updated_at":"2014-06-26T08:53:04Z","closed_at":"2014-06-26T08:53:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi!\n\nIn AndroidGameWindow.cs, this line\n\nGame.Activity.RequestedOrientation = requestedOrientation;\n\ncauses a crash.\n\nTo reproduce it, exit any app so that Activity is set to null and then, once in the \"android home\" just turn the phone (it may take some turns to crash).
