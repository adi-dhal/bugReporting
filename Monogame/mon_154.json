At present in XNA SpriteFont's data members are entirely private for no good reason, which means that if you want to do custom text rendering you have to throw out _everything_ and rebuild it all from scratch. \n\nIn practice, it's possible to get at the data members and use them for your own purposes because they're just rectangles and floats with a pretty sensical layout. Of course, doing this isn't portable, so having to support reflecting against both Microsoft and MonoGame's internal SpriteFont data structures is pretty awful. \n\nAt present, my solution for this was to make the Glyph instances in SpriteFont accessible so that it's usable in these scenarios. This let me do my text rendering using existing SpriteFont assets on both platforms:\n\nhttps://github.com/kevingadd/Fracture/blob/master/Squared/RenderLib/Evil.cs#L262\n\nAn alternative method would be to make the MonoGame SpriteFont implement a new interface of some kind that exposes methods for this. I'd be happy with that too, because then you can detect it with 'is'/'as' and not need #ifdefs.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1391","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1391/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1391/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1391/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1391","id":11045645,"number":1391,"title":"Platform-specific internals should be public","user":{"login":"kg","id":198130,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/198130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kg","html_url":"https://github.com/kg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2013-02-15T17:58:28Z","updated_at":"2016-02-25T07:25:40Z","closed_at":"2016-02-25T07:25:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is probably controversial, but I think all the platform-specific monogame internals should, where it makes sense, be publicly accessible - either as public readonly fields, or public getters, or whatever.\n\nTo give a specific example, right now using MonoGame on PSM has required me to aggressively fork the code because _all_ the PSM-specific handles were private. This made it impossible to call PSM-specific APIs where required, especially in cases where what I needed to do was impossible to express through the XNA API.\n\nI understand that this might create a risk of people writing games that are no longer 'Just XNA', but I think now that XNA is officially dead and buried this is less of a concern - especially since MonoGame can be run natively on windows.

Long story short, we are doing a dictionary lookup for readers and writers, but at runtime we can't use this lookup against an instance of this generic type.

The GL context cannot even be shifted to the worker thread temporarily.  The work-around is to load the data from file on a worker thread, but pass control back to the main thread for GL calls.  This can only be done when the main thread is ready.  Currently the main thread polls for waiting work before and after calls to Game.Update and Draw.\n\nWith the synchronous nature of the standard XNA ContentManager, only one asset can ever be waiting to be created on the main thread.  That asset must be fully loaded before the next asset is loaded from file.\n\nOne solution would require the addition of an asynchronous ContentManager.Load method that would allow multiple assets to be loaded and queued to make more use of the time in the main thread by allocating multiple GL resources each time the main thread checks for pending work.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1372","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1372/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1372/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1372/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1372","id":10994602,"number":1372,"title":"Windows installer should check previous versions are uninstalled","user":{"login":"KonajuGames","id":694943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/694943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames","html_url":"https://github.com/KonajuGames","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":185445795,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/Help%20Wanted","name":"Help Wanted","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":526188,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/Windows","name":"Windows","color":"f99319","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/11","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestone/11","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/11/labels","id":1647175,"number":11,"title":"3.7 Release","description":"","creator":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":91,"closed_issues":85,"state":"open","created_at":"2016-03-16T04:39:49Z","updated_at":"2017-10-04T20:19:23Z","due_on":"2017-06-06T07:00:00Z","closed_at":null},"comments":7,"created_at":"2013-02-14T13:03:22Z","updated_at":"2017-03-09T08:22:54Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We have had a few issues caused by installing the released version over existing beta installations.
