SharpDX for Windows does not appear to have the enum value for it.  Added the special case for this so it didn't create a Color format texture by default.\n\nOther issues found during the investigation of the above fix.\n- Found a resource leak when using Texture2D.FromStream() in DirectX.  The texture created in PlatformConstruct() was overwritten by the texture created in PlatformFromStream().  Texture2D instances constructed normally already had the texture created in the call to PlatformSetData() if required.\n- Removed a redundant creation of DataBox in PlatformSetData(). UpdateSubresource has an override to take the separate parameters that was called internally by the DataBox override anyway.\n- Texture2D.CreateTex2DFromBitmap() should not need to be public since it is only used internally.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4777/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4776","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4776/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4776/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4776/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4776","id":149108250,"number":4776,"title":"Make
