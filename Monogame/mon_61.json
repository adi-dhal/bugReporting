is not a MonoGame issue but a system requirement for Windows (DirectX) projects I'd like to document.\n\nWhen trying to play a `Song` through `MediaPlayer`, it may happen that you or your players run into a `System.DllNotFoundException` raised by `SharpDX.MediaFoundation.MediaFactory.Startup` and concerning the Mfplat.dll\n\nThis is due to the fact that the running operating system is a so called \"Windows N\" or \"KN\". The \"N\" means that the Windows version doesn't have Windows Media Player installed and also lack a few music playback related DLL's.\nThese versions of Windows are not very common and are most probably only found in some professional environments and a few countries where anti-competitive policies are enforced regarding Windows Media Player.\n\nTo resolve this problem, users have to install the **Media Feature Pack** of the corresponding Windows version:\n- Windows 7 N Download: http://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=16546\n- Windows 8 N Download: http://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=30685\n- Windows 8.1 N Download: http://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=40744\n- Windows 10 N Download: https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=48231\n\nWindows Vista & XP (which don't have this feature pack) users should be invited to install **Windows Media Player**:\n- http://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/windows-media-player-details.aspx?id=8163\n\nIf you are distributing a Windows project, it is advised to warn your players about this (in addition to DirectX June 2010 redist & .Net 4.0 requirements). Please be aware that redistributing these feature packs is not allowed by their EULA. A good practice would be to detect the presence of Mfplat.dll and invite users to install this pack.\n\nIf I have time, I'll update the MonoGame documention with a \"how to distribute your project\" page for every target platforms and how to cleanly package them.\n\nEDIT: to detect if the media feature are installed, you can check if the registry value `IsInstalled` is set to 1 for the key `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Active Setup\\Installed Components\\{6BF52A52-394A-11d3-B153-00C04F79FAA6}`\n\nSample code (to place at the beginning of your main, for example):\n\n```\nobject legacyWMPCheck = Microsoft.Win32.Registry.GetValue(@\"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Active Setup\\Installed Components\\{22d6f312-b0f6-11d0-94ab-0080c74c7e95}\", \"IsInstalled\", null);\n            if (legacyWMPCheck == null || legacyWMPCheck.ToString() != \"1\")\n            {\n                MessageBox.Show(\"It appears that you don't have Windows Media Player installed.

Here is a graph showing what it's currently doing. The colours represent the resulting thumbstick vector length: Blue = 0 (i.e. the deadzone), Green = Normal range, Yellow = 1 (i.e. full movement)\n![circular_deadzone_with_circular_gate](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5249498/10328138/1e79c7c8-6ce3-11e5-980a-e3cbdbe7ccd6.png)\nSo you can see from the big thick yellow area that the values are being clipped. This results in a halfway movement of the thumbstick being equivalent to a full movement. This is not what I'd expect. And looking at Shawn Hargreaves blog article on this subject (http://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnhar/archive/2007/03/28/gamepads-suck.aspx), the graphs he provided don't seem to show any clipping being done like this. So I'm assuming this behaviour is actually incorrect.\n\nThis is my expectation of what the graph should actually look like (which is in line with Shawn Hargreaves graph):\n![new_method_with_circular_gate](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5249498/10328141/24f2b6c8-6ce3-11e5-8b45-1e5d9ba278af.png)\n\nUnless anyone has reason to believe I'm wrong about this, I'm planning to submit a PR soon which corrects this.\n\nAlso on a related note - While looking into this, I came across the GamePadThumbSticks.Gate property. I can't seem to find this in XNA, so I assume it's been added to MonoGame for some reason? I'm not sure exactly why this setting is needed, but the default for it is GateType.Round (which normalises the thumbstick vector if it's length is greater than 1). So if I set it to GateType.None, then the above graph now looks like this:\n![circular_deadzone_with_no_gate](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5249498/10328143/2b1bbc48-6ce3-11e5-983a-b8c8b9039419.png)\nRed means that the vector length exceeds the expected maximum of 1. So basically GateType.Round was hiding these out of range values coming from the circular deadzone function.\n\nDoes anyone know why this Gate property was added to MonoGame? It seems unnecessary as the deadzone setting could be controlling this (ie. GamePadDeadZone.IndependentAxes => GateType.Square,  GamePadDeadZone.Circular => GateType.Round, GamePadDeadZone.None => GateType.None). I have a funny feeling that it might have been added to correct these out of range values, so it might be unnecessary if this was the reason.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4170/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4169","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4169/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4169/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4169/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4169","id":109714058,"number":4169,"title":"Colors
