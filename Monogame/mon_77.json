This is so that I can do this inside MonoDevelop:\n\n![protogameeditor](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/504826/7005343/71f29df8-dcba-11e4-812c-252e75f03689.png)\n\nThis is done by implementing `IEmbedContext` in the main application and passing it to the game when creating it.\n\nAn example standalone implementation of the embed context (with just a normal `GLWidget` in a standard GTK# application) is:\n\n``` csharp\nusing System;\nusing Microsoft.Xna.Framework;\nusing Gtk;\n\nnamespace ProtogameEditor\n{\n    public class EditorHostEmbedContext : IEmbedContext\n    {\n        private Gtk.Widget _glWidget;\n\n        public OpenTK.Graphics.IGraphicsContext GraphicsContext\n        {\n            get;\n            set;\n        }\n\n        public OpenTK.Platform.IWindowInfo WindowInfo\n        {\n            get;\n            set;\n        }\n\n        public Gtk.Widget GLWidget\n        {\n            get\n            {\n                return this._glWidget;\n            }\n            set\n            {\n                if (this._glWidget != null)\n                {\n                    this._glWidget.ConfigureEvent -= this.Resize;\n                }\n\n                this._glWidget = value;\n\n                if (this._glWidget != null)\n                {\n                    this._glWidget.ConfigureEvent += this.Resize;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        public System.Drawing.Point PointToClient(System.Drawing.Point point)\n        {\n            int x, y;\n            if (this.GLWidget.GdkWindow == null)\n            {\n                return new System.Drawing.Point(0, 0);\n            }\n\n            this.GLWidget.GdkWindow.GetOrigin(out x, out y);\n            return new System.Drawing.Point(\n                point.X - x,\n                point.Y - y);\n        }\n\n        public Rectangle GetClientBounds()\n        {\n            return new Rectangle(\n                0,\n                0,\n                this.GLWidget.Allocation.Width,\n                this.GLWidget.Allocation.Height);\n        }\n\n        public event System.EventHandler OnResize;\n\n        public void Resize(object sender, ConfigureEventArgs e)\n        {\n            if (this.OnResize != null)\n            {\n                this.OnResize(this, new System.EventArgs());\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nand then using it in an application like this (the dependency injection kernel is just passing in the EditorHostEmbedContext as the first argument to the game constructor):\n\n``` csharp\nusing Gtk;\nusing Protogame;\nusing Ninject;\nusing Microsoft.Xna.Framework;\nusing ProtogameEditor;\n\nnamespace ProtogameEditorHost\n{\n    public static class Program\n    {\n        public static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            Application.Init();\n\n            var window = new HostWindow();\n            window.Show();\n\n            var editor = new IDEEditor();\n\n            var kernel = editor.CreateEditorKernel<EditorHostEmbedContext>();\n\n            var context = kernel.Get<IEmbedContext>();\n\n            EditorGame game = null;\n\n            while (true)\n            {\n                Application.RunIteration();\n\n                if (window.GLWidget.WindowInfo != null && game == null)\n                {\n                    ((EditorHostEmbedContext)context).GraphicsContext = window.GLWidget.GraphicsContext;\n                    ((EditorHostEmbedContext)context).WindowInfo = window.GLWidget.WindowInfo;\n                    ((EditorHostEmbedContext)context).GLWidget = window.GLWidget;\n\n                    game = new EditorGame(kernel);\n                }\n\n                if (game != null)\n                {\n                    game.RunOneFrame();\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3708","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3708/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3708/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3708/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3708","id":66572871,"number":3708,"title":"Include
