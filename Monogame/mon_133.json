Added helper function in Texture2D called ConvertToRGBA\nto convert the pixel data.  Images now save as properly colored JPEGs.\n\nNote:  This function will block permanently if called from the Main/UI thread.  This happens because WriteableBitmap needs to be called from the UI thread and ManualResetEventSlim will pause the UI thread, called the dispatcher to invoke the UI thread when it ready...but the UI thread will never be ready because you just paused it!  Therefore, this function can currently only be called from a background thread. (It was setup this way when I found it, and I couldn't think of a better solution so I left it).  Also, this is my first commit to this project so if I did anything wrong/silly please let me know!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2029/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2028","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2028/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2028/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2028/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2028","id":20017773,"number":2028,"title":"[Linux]Cursor reappearing","user":{"login":"DrPandemic","id":3250155,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3250155?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrPandemic","html_url":"https://github.com/DrPandemic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrPandemic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrPandemic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrPandemic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrPandemic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrPandemic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrPandemic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrPandemic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrPandemic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrPandemic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-09-25T01:41:16Z","updated_at":"2017-04-30T01:32:56Z","closed_at":"2017-04-30T01:32:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When I'm on Linux (not on windows) and I hide the mouse cursor, it can't get out of the window frame (that's ok).

I have a question. In XNA, with VS2010 you can compile shaders right at visual studio in C#. Now, Microsoft is cutdown XNA. So, I like monogame, I like new versions of visual studio and I(not actually only me) ,want make shaders inside these versions(and push them to the Effect, of course). So my question is\n\n\"Will monogame team make a plugin which enable easy compilation/test shaders in VS/xamarin/mono ? VC++ is not a good way for this - its too hard and slowly(due slow vc++ compiler) to create a whole c++ project and test shaders in it. Monogame already can construct shaders from bytecode, why not implement MGFX tool as shader compiler and add shaders templates directly to VS C# ?\"\n\nThis will up creativity to new level for sure.\n\nOld programms like FXComposer is not a good things.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2005","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2005/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2005/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2005/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2005","id":19752807,"number":2005,"title":"Issue
