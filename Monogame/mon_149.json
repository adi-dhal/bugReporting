This feature does not exist in XNA, but actually fits in pretty elegantly into the API.\n- Added RenderTarget3D class with DX implementation.\n- Added GraphicsDevice.SetRenderTarget(RenderTarget3D, arraySlice).\n- Made RenderTargetBinding a little more generic to handle both cube and 3D textures.\n-  Fixed bug were Texture3D.Format was not set.\n\nThis should be portable to OpenGL desktop systems, but i'm not sure of OpenGL ES platforms.\n\nAlso this currently only works by selecting the depth layer to render into on the CPU side via `GraphicsDevice.SetRenderTarget`.  Eventually when we support geometry shaders in MGFX we can also do this on the GPU.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1548","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1548/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1548/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1548/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1548","id":12089296,"number":1548,"title":"Fix

allot of the samples are broken or not implemented for many of the platforms. \n\nThe Samples are hosted at https://github.com/CartBlanche/MonoGame-Samples.\n\nTo work on the Samples you should fork the master on that repo and submit pull requests to that repository.  \n\nNote there is a SamplesContentBuilder project in the Samples repo to build the required .xnb files for Fonts, Textures , Effects etc, this builds the data to the CompiledContent directory. you will find .xnb files for each platform in that directory. When updating a sample, if the font/ texture/ Effect does not exist in the Content Builder it should be added and compiled for each platform. The resulting .xnb file should be added to git and commited along with you other changes.If possible use existing fonts and assets for the sample. The ContentBuilder is dependent on having the 3.0.x release installed.\n\nOnce the .xnb is in place, you can then link to the file from the project as normal. Please when you add it to the project make sure you \"add as link\" so it does not copy the file locally, we are trying to pull all the assets in the one place.\n\nOnce you have a sample working for a platform, please update the following wiki entry\n\nhttps://github.com/mono/MonoGame/wiki/Samples\n\nIMPORTANT : So we can keep track of when someone is working on a sample please put your initials in the relevant box for the sample and platform you are working on.

Because [according to the docs](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.assembly.getentryassembly.aspx) `GetEntryAssembly()` can return null when called from unmanaged code which I guess is what it does from VS.  Either way it seems safer to test and costs us nothing.\n\nSecond I replaced two places where `Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location` was being used.  The point of this code was to ensure the right path which can find the data files needed for running the tests.  When the \"executing assembly\" is a unit test runner like ReSharper it does not exist in the same folder as the test data.  `AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory` is the proper way to get the directory where execution started.\n\nFinally I removed an incorrect disposal of GraphicsDeviceManager in WinFormsGamePlatform.  Game already takes care of this for us.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1530/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1529","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1529/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1529/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1529/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1529","id":11859336,"number":1529,"title":"First overload of CreateBillboard returns incorrect results","user":{"login":"AdamDawes","id":2230300,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2230300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamDawes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":12,"created_at":"2013-03-10T23:08:50Z","updated_at":"2014-06-29T03:20:57Z","closed_at":"2014-06-29T03:20:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm converting my XNA billboard example projects to run in MonoGame and I think I have found a bug in one of the versions of the Matrix.CreateBillboard function. None of my billboard objects are visible at all in MonoGame, and after spending some time trying to figure out where the invisible scoundrels have gone, I think that Matrix.CreateBillboard looks like the culprit.\n\nI'm calling it with the following parameters:\n\n```\nMatrix result = Matrix.CreateBillboard(Vector3.Zero, new Vector3(0.0f, 0.7f, 2.0f), Vector3.Up, Vector3.Forward)\n```\n\nExecuting this against XNA 4.0 returns a Matrix with the following content:\n\n```\n{ {M11:-1 M12:0 M13:0 M14:0} {M21:0 M22:0.9438583 M23:-0.3303504 M24:0} {M31:0 M32:-0.3303504 M33:-0.9438583 M34:0} {M41:0 M42:0 M43:0 M44:1} }\n    Backward: {X:0 Y:-0.3303504 Z:-0.9438583}\n    Down: {X:0 Y:-0.9438583 Z:0.3303504}\n    Forward: {X:0 Y:0.3303504 Z:0.9438583}\n    Left: {X:1 Y:0 Z:0}\n    M11: -1.0\n    M12: 0.0\n    M13: 0.0\n    M14: 0.0\n    M21: 0.0\n    M22: 0.9438583\n    M23: -0.3303504\n    M24: 0.0\n    M31: 0.0\n    M32: -0.3303504\n    M33: -0.9438583\n    M34: 0.0\n    M41: 0.0\n    M42: 0.0\n    M43: 0.0\n    M44: 1.0\n    Right: {X:-1 Y:0 Z:0}\n    Translation: {X:0 Y:0 Z:0}\n    Up: {X:0 Y:0.9438583 Z:-0.3303504}\n```\n\nExecuting the same call in MonoGame (3.0.0.0 release binaries) returns the following Matrix:\n\n```\n{M11:0.9438583 M12:0 M13:0 M14:0} {M21:0 M22:1 M23:0 M24:0} {M31:0 M32:-0.3303504 M33:-0.9438583 M34:0} {M41:0 M42:0 M43:0 M44:1}\n    Backward: {X:0 Y:-0.3303504 Z:-0.9438583}\n    Down: {X:0 Y:-1 Z:0}\n    Forward: {X:0 Y:0.3303504 Z:0.9438583}\n    Left: {X:-0.9438583 Y:0 Z:0}\n    M11: 0.9438583\n    M12: 0.0\n    M13: 0.0\n    M14: 0.0\n    M21: 0.0\n    M22: 1.0\n    M23: 0.0\n    M24: 0.0\n    M31: 0.0\n    M32: -0.3303504\n    M33: -0.9438583\n    M34: 0.0\n    M41: 0.0\n    M42: 0.0\n    M43: 0.0\n    M44: 1.0\n    Right: {X:0.9438583 Y:0 Z:0}\n    Translation: {X:0 Y:0 Z:0}\n    Up: {X:0 Y:1 Z:0}\n```\n\nNote in particular that the Left and Right vectors are not normalised in MonoGame and are pointing in the opposite directions to the corresponding vectors in XNA.\n\nI looked at the current code in MonoGame's Matrix.cs file and found the two overloads of CreateBillboard. The first of these has a small piece of code that creates an identity matrix and then manipulates its Forward, Left, Up and Translation vectors. After this is a much larger piece of code that has been commented out with no explanation. This is the overload that is returning the wrong matrix.\n\nThe second overload (that return the Matrix via an \"out Matrix result\" parameter) has only the code that has been commented out in the first overload, and appears to be returning the correct value. If I switch my project to use this (much less convenient) second overload, all the particles reappear as expected.\n\nIt looks therefore like the current code in the first overload simply needs to be replaced with the commented out code. If I had the faintest idea how to create a pull request then I'd make the change and submit it, but I don't have the free time to figure that out at the moment so I'm hoping someone else can deal with this for me.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1529/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1528","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1528/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1528/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1528/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1528","id":11858856,"number":1528,"title":"OpenTK Future","user":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":27759082,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/Maintenance","name":"Maintenance","color":"000000","default":false},{"id":27755158,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/OpenGL","name":"OpenGL","color":"02e10c","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":45,"created_at":"2013-03-10T22:33:04Z","updated_at":"2014-04-05T07:31:52Z","closed_at":"2014-03-03T00:39:39Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"We need to decide how we want to handle OpenTK moving forward.\n\nThe official state of OpenTK is unknown as the sole maintainer has gone MIA, [Is OpenTK Dead?](http://www.opentk.com/node/3217), but that itself is a pretty bad sign of things.\n\nIn particular we have a need to fix bugs more than anything else.
