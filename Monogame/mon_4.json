A piece of code:\r\n```\r\nprotected override void LoadContent()\r\n{\r\n            spriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(GraphicsDevice);\r\n            AudioManager.LoadContent(Content);\r\n            SceneManager.LoadScenesContent(Content);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSo, usually, just for a moment (like a half second) I can see my splash graphic, then black screen (for about 4 seconds), and then my main menu. \r\n\r\nI'm fighting with this issue really long time, started digging in Monogame source code but could not help myself. This is critical issue for me. What could lead to such a behavior ? Can I expect cool Monogame team to fix this ?\r\n\r\nVerified on Nexus 5 with Android 6\r\n\r\n**EDIT:**\r\nIn logcat I can see: Skipped 127 frames ! The application may be doing too much work on its main thread.\r\n\r\nEven when I cutted off loading almost of all the assets - left only loading for main menu (some background, buttons, sounds and fonts) ..

reproduce: In Xamarin Studio, create new MonoGame iPhone/iPad application and click build.\r\n\r\nI'm on macOS Sierra running mono version 5.2.0.215. Before installing the new development build, everything worked just fine.\r\n\r\nDo you have any idea of what might be the issue?

Build the `MonoGame.Framework.MsBuildTasks` project, and then put the `MonoGame.Framework.MsBuildTasks` dll in `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MSBuild\\MonoGame\\v3.0\\Tools\\` folder.\r\n2.

trying to build my MonoGame project on Travis (under Linux) and run my unit tests. I'm stuck on the step where I bootstrap MonoGame.\r\n\r\nAs of MonoGame 3.6 (I think 3.4 worked at some point), running `monogame-sdk.run` requires user intervention; after checking and listing pre-requisites, there's a prompt that says `Continue (Y, n):` and doesn't proceed unless there's a human present to enter input.\r\n\r\nI tried piping input several ways, but nothing seems to work. I also looked for any command-line arguments that I can use (including editing the source shell script part) but didn't find anything.\r\n\r\nPlease provide some way for the installation to proceed without human intervention, and please also tell me if there's a work-around for this in the meanwhile. (I tried extracting the contents but the prompt comes from `postinstall.sh` and there doesn't seem to be a way around it.)\r\n\r\nI tried opening a PR for this myself, but couldn't figure out how to check the command-line arguments properly. It looks like `makeshelf` sends in two parameters already, and I'm not clear how to build the `makeshelf` file to test my changes.\r\n\r\nNB: I reported this issue forst on [makeshelf, here](https://github.com/megastep/makeself/issues/113) and through that, figured out that it really is the MonoGame installer script that's prompting for input.  This is also something of a duplicate of [my community post](http://community.monogame.net/t/running-monogame-sdk-run-on-linux-without-confirmation-travis-ci/9567), albeit I documented my work-around there (use a custom `postinstall.sh` that doesn't prompt for confirmation).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5878","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5878/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5878/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5878/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5878","id":250669208,"number":5878,"title":"ViewPort remains at 800x600 regardless of backbuffer size","user":{"login":"DDReaper","id":1793042,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1793042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper","html_url":"https://github.com/DDReaper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DDReaper/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-08-16T15:31:29Z","updated_at":"2017-08-16T15:31:29Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Tested in both existing and new projects.

am building a sample application in Xamarin Mac OSX (Xamarin.Mac Project) which need to use a Monogame Framework api Version 3.2.\r\n\r\nScenario 1 : When I simply build the Xamarin sample application (Xamarin.Mac)(without any additional implementation of Monogame funtionality) then the application gets compile without any error and shows the output.\r\n\r\nScenario 2 : When I build the application with additional implementation of Monogame,  the application gets compile without any error for Monogame version 3.6. (referencing Monogame.Framework.dll 3.6 version - from the nugget package).\r\n\r\nScenario 3 : Here now I am using compiled version of Monogame Framework 3.6 Source Code. When  I build my sample application with additional implementation of Monogame, the application gives error which is mentioned in title \r\n(The assembly \"XamMac.dll\" is not compatible with the tool or profile (MM1402)). \r\n -- (referencing Monogame.Framework.dll 3.6 version dll  by compiling the Monogame Framework Source Code in Visual Studio 2017 Community - 7.0.1 Build 24).\r\n\r\n3.A. The Monogame Framework Library Project is Migrated to the Xamarin Mac project by the Visual Studio before compilation.\r\n3.B. The monogame Framework Library project is compiled without Migration.\r\n\r\nIn scenario 3.A. It gives me an error.. \r\n - The assembly \"XamMac.dll\" is not compatible with the tool or profile (MM1402).\r\n\r\nIn Scenario 3.B it gives me an error..\r\n- The assembly \"MonoMac.dll\" is not compatible with the tool or profile (MM1402). \r\n\r\nI reproduced the similar issue for the nugget package manager Monogame Framework.dll 3.2,3.3 version as well Monogame Framework source code compiled version 3.2,3.3.\r\n\r\nBut there is a dependency of XamMac even after migration of the Monogame Framework Source Code to Xamarin.Mac.\r\n\r\nI tried to migrate the Monogame Framework Library Project to unified version by following the given steps here - \r\nhttps://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/macios/unified/updating-mac-apps/\r\nBut I am not able to port the app to Xamarin.Mac by removing XamMac.dll dependency in app.\r\n\r\nAfter removal of warnings I was just able to see the option of \"Migration to Xamarin.Mac\" under project option.\r\nI did the migration to Xamarin.Mac .Net Framework 4.5 and then in project references I was able to see the Xamarin.Mac dll instead of XamMac.dll (which is good).\r\n\r\nBut after migration and compilation I am getting many errors (165) out of which I am able to resolve the ones are in Using directives but It’s difficult to resolve other missing reference errors.\r\nI also tried it to migrate to Xamarin.Mac Mobile Framework but similar 163 errors I am getting after compilation.\r\n\r\nFor my MacOS Xamarin sample app project say “ABC” (which is a unified Xamarin.Mac app) I am using reference of this compiled library project (Monogame.Framework.dll). And for that this Library project should not be XamMac.dll dependent but should be Xamarin.Mac migrated api.\r\n\r\nSome more findings and details for your reference.\r\n\r\n1. I need this Monogame Framework Library project dll 3.2 version because it has some old implementation which is actually supporting my Sample App ABC.\r\n\r\n2. If I do compile Monogame Framework 3.6 latest version library project, I get same issue with compilation because of XamMac.dll and migration.\r\n\r\n3. Monogame framework 3.6 version dll from nugget packet works well when I reference it in my sample app ABC without XamMac.dll error as in title \r\n(No idea how it has built/compiled after migration and how the Monogame team has resolved those 165 errors after Migration to XamarinMac unified API)).\r\n\r\n4. Standalone 3.2 version dll from nugget packet doesn’t work well and gives the same error in title.\r\n\r\n5. I need Monogame framework 3.2 version to build/compile after migration to XamarinMac Unified API.\r\n\r\nKindly Let me know if you have any thoughts or workaround.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5875/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5874","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5874/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5874/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5874/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5874","id":250357394,"number":5874,"title":"Improved performance of SpriteFont.MeasureString() & SpriteBatch.DrawString()","user":{"login":"nkast","id":3018589,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3018589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast","html_url":"https://github.com/nkast","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/11","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestone/11","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/11/labels","id":1647175,"number":11,"title":"3.7 Release","description":"","creator":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":91,"closed_issues":85,"state":"open","created_at":"2016-03-16T04:39:49Z","updated_at":"2017-10-04T20:19:23Z","due_on":"2017-06-06T07:00:00Z","closed_at":null},"comments":7,"created_at":"2017-08-15T15:54:58Z","updated_at":"2017-08-28T04:58:04Z","closed_at":"2017-08-28T00:04:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/5874","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5874","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5874.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5874.patch"},"body":"* Glyph lookup\r\nReplace Dictionary<char, Glyph> with a Glyph[] array and a custom CharacterRegion struct.
