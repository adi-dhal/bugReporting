just verified it, using a older open gl version template i know worked.\nThe below image the window is shrunk far further with no bugs.\nThe data chunks scale straight to the window no matter how i resize it correctly.\n\nthe current windows dx version is bugged im on win7 vs 2013.\n\n_Note the fps text in white here is not scaled and gets cut off as i shrink the window properly.\nThe exact same code in a older gl version the manually scaled images work normally_\n**GL older version**\n<img

started this subjet on twitter : https://twitter.com/oldteen_tt/status/729763421240098816\n\nBrief history of my case:\n- I am trying to make a game based on FNA\n- I want to try android/ios/xbox one support, so I compile my code with monogame 3.6\n- And I see these ram conssumption for my game running in debug mode : with FNA +- 100MB and with monogame +-200MB\n\nAfter make some tests, monogame memory consumption follow the backbuffer size. In 4k my game eat more than 300MB with monogame and stay at 100MB with FNA. (the others values was in 1080p)\n\nI've made a new test with the code output by monogame template, just change the backbuffer size\n**4k**\nfna : 50MB\nMG : 150 MB\n**1080p**\nfna : 50MB\nMG : 93 MB\n**640x360**\nfna : 50MB\nMG : 65 MB\n\nDid I forget something ? a parameter ?\nI know that 3.6 is not a finished version, but I am curious, maybe too much ;)\n\nI hope these informations can help or I hope that I've made a mistake.\n\nEdit: I use DesktopGL

found out that MonoGame just passes the value to DirectX without modification and DirectX applies it as a factor to a very small number that is calculated based on the depth buffer format.\n\nMy theory now is that XNA does some math with the DepthBias value to make it easier for the developer to deal with it.\n\nIn my case (24bit depth buffer) the following formula gives exactly the same visual result as -0.0004f in XNA:\n`state.DepthBias = (float)(-0.0004f / (1 / Math.Pow(2,

you have to initialize a bunch of colors the current setters and constructors are inefficient.  They all do internal math to scale or clamp values to back to a byte then pack them.  Often this math isn't needed but is there just in case someone passes an out of range value.\n\nI suggest extending the API to support two additional constructors directly taking a packed value and channel bytes:\n\n```\npublic Color(uint packedValue)\n{\n...\n}\n\npublic Color(byte red, byte green, byte blue, byte alpha)\n{\n...\n}\n```\n\nThese would be the most efficient constructors one could use.\n\nWe should also document the packed format in the reference docs on the new ctor and the packed value getter/setter.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4824/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4823","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4823/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4823/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4823/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4823","id":153302239,"number":4823,"title":"Tests
