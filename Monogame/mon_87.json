Platform specific code should always remain in a Platform project (like iOS), where as all common \"core\" code should be used in the PCL.\n\nQuestion is now how to provide this framework back in to the MonoGame project so it can be run in an automated fashion.  In the branch above (using Protobuild as a template) I've created a new ThirdParty folder for Piranah and put the runtime exe and Dll's in there.\nThere is a commandline file to generate the project manually for test at the moment (need both the WindowsGL project built and an output folder in MonoGame.Framework/bin/PCL created first)\n\nI've also started on a new MonoGame.Portable NuGet package, which is still a work in progress.

would be nice if there was a quick download that included the pipeline tool\nthe 3.2 official download doesn't have it, nor do the dev or nightly builds include it\nthat's fine if you dont want to use fx files or models but most people do\n\nso then the zip download for the source has the folder. but...\nwhen you dl it, then run protobuild... you get solutions   but .... vs wont compile it\nit will give tons of errors instead, im guessing this is because dependancy's are missing\nbut you find that out after the fact with no instructions or warning\n\nif a new guy feels corralled into using github \nbecause of constantly failing to get monogame working,  then he must now\nlearn how to use github and git... before ... installing monogme\nthe problem with this is he is probably new or solo (xna was for indies) \nadditionally he isn't clicking something called\n\"learn how to use git so you can learn how to install monogame\"\n\nbasically unlike xna, \nthis amounts to jumping thru hoops non stop to load fx files or a model\nworse finding the particular instructions is horrible because \nthere are so many on the net and here, most are incomplete (missing steps) confusing (leave out requisite steps) or worse simply don't apply or work\n\nmost people will simply just give up long before this and go download unity or something else\nseriously nothing is worse \nthen downloading something that you need to sift thru a unorganized confusing 10 page \ninstallation instruction manual just to get it to fully install\nit makes it very hard to recommend monogame to anyone who wants to do 3d stuff\nwhen you have to tell them there is a bunch of stuff you have to read to install it\n\nso again point is... it would be nice if there was a install download that included the pipeline
