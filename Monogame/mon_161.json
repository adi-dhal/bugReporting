Create a default game for Android and load a single texture that is smaller than the screen size into a `Texture2D tex` member. Then add the following drawing code.

pull request fixes an offset bug on OpenGL platforms when changing the viewport size.\n\nThe OpenGL version of MonoGame uses an uniform named \"posFixup\" to offset any rendering by a fraction of the

The flushing in SpriteBatch generate significant amount of garbage. Since SpriteBatch flushes every single time a resource (texture) is changed, even inside Begin/End pair, changing a texture contributes to increase in allocations in the heap.\n\nAs little as a dozen of textures in a test project already causes the garbage collector to run every 1 - 3 seconds (with latency depending on hardware). On the PC, this doesn't becomes problematic until much much later (perhaps hundreds of textures) when other areas of the code become bottlenecks too. But on the ARM (Surface RT specifically), which is much more sensitive to garbage collection, the effect is devastating.\n\nIn my test code, I continued to push the number of textures, that on a PC causes not issues whatsoever, but on the Surface RT, cause spikes (and severe drop in FPS) every second or so.\n\nI haven't investigated far enough to figure out whether this happens somewhere in Flush or deep enough all the way in SharpDX's DrawUserPrimitives.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1172/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1171","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1171/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1171/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1171/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1171","id":9861977,"number":1171,"title":"Ouya - Gamepad always returns true for isConnected","user":{"login":"chaosnhatred","id":1500273,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1500273?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaosnhatred","html_url":"https://github.com/chaosnhatred","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaosnhatred/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaosnhatred/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaosnhatred/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaosnhatred/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaosnhatred/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaosnhatred/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaosnhatred/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaosnhatred/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaosnhatred/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2013-01-10T22:09:07Z","updated_at":"2017-04-24T21:03:42Z","closed_at":"2017-04-24T21:03:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In this issue https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/issues/1170\nit was noted that Android will always return true for isConnected for the Gamepad.\n\nAs Ouya heavily relies on controllers, this may need to change for that platform as to implement the Gamepad API for its detection.\n\nAs i am aware the Gamepad API is not Needed, but for this issue it might need to be implemented anyway.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1170","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1170/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1170/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1170/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1170","id":9860372,"number":1170,"title":"GamePad.IsConnected is true on android but false on WP7","user":{"login":"totallyeviljake","id":2798768,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2798768?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/totallyeviljake","html_url":"https://github.com/totallyeviljake","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/totallyeviljake/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/totallyeviljake/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/totallyeviljake/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/totallyeviljake/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/totallyeviljake/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/totallyeviljake/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/totallyeviljake/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/totallyeviljake/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/totallyeviljake/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2013-01-10T21:24:50Z","updated_at":"2017-05-02T20:13:38Z","closed_at":"2017-05-02T20:13:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The following code returns false on a Windows Phone 7 device:\n\n```\n        if (GamePad.GetState(PlayerIndex.One).IsConnected)\n```\n\nThe same code reports true on Android.\n\nOn WP7 all player indices report false.

The expected behaviour is for anything drawn to the render target to be anti-aliased using MSAA, the resolved sample count and the standard multi-sample pattern. Note that the standard XNA behaviour for the resolved sample count may not be equal to the preferred sample count passed into the RenderTarget2D constructor depending on device support - you can specify 16 on a card that only supports 8 and you should receive an 8x MSAA render target.\n\nI have tried this using the Windows Phone 8 and Metro builds.\n\nSome more information from my comment on https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/issues/358:\n\nI created a RenderTarget2D (in my game code) with a multisample count of 8, surface format of Color and DepthFormat of None, then drew that to the screen with a SpriteBatch. I validated the approach in my Win32 build (by setting the back buffer multisampling off) and the result was as you'd expect - multi-sampled goodness.\n\nI had a dig around and found that the Texture2D constructor was always setting SampleDescription to {1, 0} - so I added a parameter to the internal constructor to pass down the preferredMultiSampleCount from the RenderTarget2D constructor, and set up the sample description exactly as it is for the depth buffer in RenderTarget2D (preferredMultiSampleCount, SharpDX.Direct3D11.StandardMultisampleQualityLevels.StandardMultisamplePattern).\n\nNow on Windows Phone 8 that blew up - I couldn't find any combination of values for the SampleDescription that didn't result in a SharpDXException with 'The parameter is incorrect'.\n\nOn Windows 8 Metro it created the texture & render target just fine. However, it still wasn't multi-sampled. Using the debugger to look at the 'Description' member of the _texture object for the suggested that the sample description was correct {8,-1}.\n\nPlease note that this MSDN article (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/jj681697(v=vs.105).aspx) suggests that it should be possible for Windows Phone 8, at least.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1161","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1161/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1161/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1161/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1161","id":9732538,"number":1161,"title":"Updated
