my Game class, I use the Initialize method to set up my lighting, including setting my effect object's DirectionalLight0 properties. I set the DirectionalLight0.DiffuseColor and .SpecularColor both to White, and these colours are applied to the objects that I render in my game.\n\nThen I add a call to Content.Load<Model> in my LoadContent method. Just by doing this, all the lights go out, and everything in the game appears as a black silhouette. If I query the DirectionalLight0.DiffuseColor and .SpecularColor after calling Content.Load, they both still report themselves as being white, but if I then actually assign white to them again, the lights switch back on.\n\nI've worked around this for now by adding the following code to the end of my LoadContent method:\n\n```\n_effect.DirectionalLight0.DiffuseColor = _effect.DirectionalLight0.DiffuseColor;\n_effect.DirectionalLight0.SpecularColor = _effect.DirectionalLight0.SpecularColor;\n```\n\ni.e., setting the light colours to be their existing values. This resolves the problem. I'm not sure why loading a model is causing my lights to stop working, but it'd be great if they didn't do this.\n\nAn example of this can be seen in the example project here: http://adamdawes.com/private/MonoGameXFile.zip . The code as provided displays the model as a totally black silhouette. By adding the lines of code shown above to the end of the LoadContent method (after the call to Content.Load), the lighting begins to work again. (Ignore the fact that the texture doesn't appear and there's a hole in the house model, those are separate issues.)\n\nTested against MonoGame 3.0.0.0 in Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1515","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1515/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1515/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1515/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1515","id":11784656,"number":1515,"title":"GraphicsDevice.SamplerStates[0] defaults to null, whereas in XNA it defaults to SamplerState.LinearWrap","user":{"login":"AdamDawes","id":2230300,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2230300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamDawes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamDawes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2013-03-07T23:28:38Z","updated_at":"2013-03-15T19:15:50Z","closed_at":"2013-03-15T19:15:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"As I have documented at great length at http://monogame.codeplex.com/discussions/435349 I have spent several days battling to get textures to display on a model loaded using Content.Load<Model>. I eventually tracked this down to the default state of the GraphicsDevice.SamplerStates array.\n\nIn XNA 4.0, GraphicsDevice.SamplerStates[0] is set to SamplerState.LinearWrap by the time the Game class's Initialize method is called. I have an old set of MonoGame source code on my hard drive which also defaults SamplerStates[0] to the same value.\n\nIn the current MonoGame source code (retrieved from GitHub a few days ago), SamplerStates[0] is null when Initialize is called. This is the same for the v3.0.0.0 binaries. As a result, my model textures (which are not in the range of 0..1 on either axis) were being clamped and not rendered properly.\n\nNow that I understand the problem, I can simply configure SamplerStates[0] myself in my Initialize method, but as this is not the same behaviour as XNA itself, I would like to propose that this be changed to default to a LinearWrap state. This has had me tearing my hair out for several days, it may well affect others too.

It took me quite a while to figure out why our game wasn't working anymore.\n\nThis PR fixes a bug found in the reflective reader. It turns out that there's some odd behavior in .NET when it comes to using Type.GetAllProperties() with an abstract class, causing inherited properties to be pulled in anyway.\n\nSuppose you have the following two classes:\n\n```\n    public class DerivedClass : BaseClass\n    {\n        public override string NameOfProperty { get; set; }\n    }\n\n    public abstract class BaseClass\n    {\n        public abstract string NameOfProperty { get; set; }\n    }\n```\n\nFor whatever reason, you override a property and didn't change it's implementation. Calling \n\n```\ntypeof(DerivedClass).GetAllProperties(BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Public | BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.DeclaredOnly);\n```\n\nWill still return NameOfProperty as one of it's properties (Even with the DeclaredOnly binding flag). Because of this, an extra check is needed to make sure we the ContentReader isn't attempting to read in the same property twice. I ran this against our game on Windows 8 and iOS, seeing the problem fixed without any adverse affects.\n\nI've also tested this against stock .NET to make sure I wasn't going crazy. But the setup above will still return the inherited property.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1502","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1502/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1502/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1502/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1502","id":11696938,"number":1502,"title":"Added

Any help would be greatly appreciated. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1496/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1495","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1495/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1495/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1495/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1495","id":11638428,"number":1495,"title":"[WindowsGL] Everything using shaders draws red only","user":{"login":"Oblivion165","id":598131,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/598131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oblivion165","html_url":"https://github.com/Oblivion165","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oblivion165/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oblivion165/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oblivion165/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oblivion165/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oblivion165/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oblivion165/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oblivion165/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oblivion165/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oblivion165/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":14,"created_at":"2013-03-04T20:53:30Z","updated_at":"2013-08-30T16:17:58Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm using some simple bloom shaders and on one of my 4 PC's, everything is drawn red.
