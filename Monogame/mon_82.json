If you switched between multiple effects, but didn't explicitly call `textureParameter.SetValue` each time, textures wouldn't be re-applied. I think this probably caused #3549.\n- If you are using a custom effect with `SpriteBatch`, and that custom effect uses a couple of textures, then XNA always sets the texture you specify in `spriteBatch.Draw` into the first texture slot, even if you have explicitly set that texture to something else in your effect parameters. This was the part I didn't understand before - but I've added a test for it now. Because of this, I can remove the `stateKey` stuff from `EffectPass`.\n\nSo this PR changes the logic to: **always use the textures specified in effect parameters (`null` or otherwise), but if you're using `SpriteBatch` then ensure `Textures[0]` is set to the texture you passed to `spriteBatch.Draw`, regardless of what the effect parameter values are.**\n\nOnce again, I'd appreciate feedback on this one. Especially after I got it wrong last time :) But if it looks good, then we should merge it as soon as possible, given that it (hopefully) fixes quite a big bug.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3554/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3553","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3553/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3553/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3553/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3553","id":58281117,"number":3553,"title":"Sporadic draw call timings","user":{"login":"xposure","id":6292318,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6292318?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xposure","html_url":"https://github.com/xposure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xposure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xposure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xposure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xposure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xposure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xposure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xposure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xposure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xposure/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2015-02-19T22:32:51Z","updated_at":"2015-02-24T18:50:18Z","closed_at":"2015-02-24T18:50:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have put together a small piece of code to reproduce the problem that can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/xposure/bff23116b9e8a2e00644) along with my log output and dxdiag.\n\nThe problem is that with a default game window and nothing running on my machine, I get draw calls at a steady 16ms as I would expect.

parameter validation for:\n- `DrawPrimitives`\n- `DrawIndexedPrimitives`\n- `DrawUserPrimitives`\n- `DrawUserIndexedPrimitives`\n\nI don't know if this is controversial - we have parameter validation elsewhere in MG, but until now the `Draw*` methods didn't have it. Obviously there is a (tiny) performance overhead. As @tomspilman has said elsewhere, it's a pity that VS doesn't make it easy to switch between debug / release assemblies, which would be the best of both worlds.\n\nI don't think `Debug.Assert` is a viable replacement, since (I assume) very few developers build MG from source (or at least, that will be true once there are more frequent MG releases), and so very few developers are using the debug assemblies.\n\n**EDIT** Forgot to say that #3125 was the trigger for this PR. However, from what I've found, XNA doesn't actually throw an exception when the `VertexDeclaration` size doesn't match the vertex data size in `DrawUser[Indexed]Primitives`. That's verified in a unit test.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3541","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3541/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3541/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3541/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3541","id":57876278,"number":3541,"title":"Performance issues calling Threading.EnsureUIThread","user":{"login":"prollin","id":502478,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/502478?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin","html_url":"https://github.com/prollin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2015-02-17T02:31:21Z","updated_at":"2015-02-17T08:03:08Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Below is an Instrument trace (30sec) from our app on an iPad Air (1st gen).
