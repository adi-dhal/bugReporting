\n/intermediateDir:\"C:\\OuyaTest\\Content\\obj\\Ouya\" \n/quiet\" exited with code -1.`\n\nI think that the problem is that there is no 'Ouya' platform in the content pipeline to build with.\nWhen I open the content file in the content pipeline and try to select a platform only these show up:\n- Android\n- DesktopGL\n- iOS\n- MacOSX\n- NativeClient\n- Playstation4\n- PlaystationMobile\n- RaspberryPi\n- Windows\n- WindowsPhone\n- WindowsPhone8\n- WindowsStoreApp\n- Xbox360\n\nAs you can see there is no 'Ouya' platform and the command does try to use it.\nIs there maybe a way to alter the command that gets run so that I could build for the 'Android' platform instead of the 'Ouya' one.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4722/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4721","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4721/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4721/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4721/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4721","id":145609725,"number":4721,"title":"Validate

#4700. This PR adds `DynamicSoundEffectInstance` implementations on XAudio and OpenAL and some unit tests which also run against XNA. I've tested the code on Windows and really quickly on Android. I also hooked it into the iOS platform, but I'm not able to test it at all.\n\nSome issues:\n- Thread safety. I've left out any locks etc., but they should be easy to add. I think this code will generate some 1-in-10000 race conditions in multithreaded code.\n- Garbage generation. For example #1982 recycled sound buffers, whereas this implementation does not. Should be easy to measure and fix.\n- Disposal. I'm able to run the tests without any finalizer/`Dispose()` crashes, but I'm confident that there are issues left.\n- ~~I used `nameof`, which is a C# 6 feature. Which language version are we using? Going back to explicit parameter names is a one-minute fix, if we want to support older compiler versions.~~\n- ~~OpenAL implementation uses the `DynamicSoundEffectInstanceManager` helper class, which has some issues:~~ (Now shared with all implementations.)\n  - ~~It depends on `GamePlatform` calling it. Plugging it into `FrameworkDispatcher` introduced in #4675 would solve that dependency.~~ (Now called by `Game`.)\n  - ~~The great SDL change will move things all around the place.~~ (Didn't thanks to above.)\n  - ~~It keeps a reference to the playing sound, which has side-effects if the user neither stops nor disposes the sound.~~ (Now holds a `WeakReference`.)\n- ~~I know nothing about the Mac side, so I haven't touched it beyond the OpenTK version.~~ (The common SDL path hopefully clears things)\n- The tests cannot confirm that the playback actually works, but rather test `PendingBufferCount`.\n- And quite possibly many others, which will hopefully be found now that this is up here!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4715/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4714","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4714/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4714/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4714/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4714","id":145460113,"number":4714,"title":"Consistant

up from #2651 with the changes requested.\n\nCurrently when MonoGame is using a fixed time step, it won't ever render faster than 60FPS, despite the GPUs capability to do so.\n\nThis modifies the tick so that if `RenderMultipleFramesPerStep` is on, it will continue to render frames until the time is used up (instead of sleeping).\n\nThis is useful for diagnosing whether rendering is responsible for causing slow frames by giving an accurate representation of how fast the current frame can be rendered.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4710/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4709","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4709/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4709/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4709/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4709","id":145411098,"number":4709,"title":"The

Maybe if we used a debug build with optimization enabled it would improve the run time significantly.\n\nThis likely would require building the code a second time specifically for unit testing.  But building the code is literally less than 10 seconds.  It also solves to other issues:\n- Smaller build artifact sizes.\n- Code coverage will be able to find source code again.\n- The test build steps can run in parallel with the code build steps.\n\nThis

months.  I wrote specific issues for a few major holes:\n- [Add Unit Tests for Model Classes](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/issues/4699)\n- [Add Unit Tests for Effect Classes](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/issues/4698)\n- [Add Ordering Tests For PackedVector](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/issues/4685)\n- [Add Unit Tests for Input Classes](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/issues/4744)\n\nStill there are more areas to cover like audio.  Look thru the \"Last successful Windows Unit Tests\" link above to see which classes are totally untested.\n\nNow code coverage metrics are tricky...  you can get 100% coverage, but do that with crappy tests.  \nFor example look at this:\n\n https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop/Test/Framework/PackedVectorTest.cs#L85\n\nI wrote most of these tests, but @Tzenchor correctly pointed out in https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/pull/4683 that while I tested for values `<= 0x0` and `>= 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF` I totally missed testing packing order.  So while we had coverage of these areas...  the coverage didn't fully test the feature.\n\nWe need to keep this in mind while striving to improve our unit tests.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4702/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4701","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4701/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4701/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4701/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4701","id":145339452,"number":4701,"title":"What are Pipeline.app and MGCB.app?","user":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":185445795,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/Help%20Wanted","name":"Help Wanted","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/11","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestone/11","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/11/labels","id":1647175,"number":11,"title":"3.7 Release","description":"","creator":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":91,"closed_issues":85,"state":"open","created_at":"2016-03-16T04:39:49Z","updated_at":"2017-10-04T20:19:23Z","due_on":"2017-06-06T07:00:00Z","closed_at":null},"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-04-02T05:46:45Z","updated_at":"2017-03-09T08:23:00Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"In the output folders for the Pipeline tool and MGCB I see a Pipeline.app folder and a MGCB.app folder.

If not how do we keep them from being generated in the first place?\n\nIf we do use them... then do we need the first copy of the binaries in the root of the Release folder?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4700","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4700/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4700/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4700/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4700","id":145333744,"number":4700,"title":"Implement DynamicSoundEffectInstance and Tests","user":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":12913841,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/Feature%20Request","name":"Feature Request","color":"000000","default":false},{"id":185445795,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/Help%20Wanted","name":"Help Wanted","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/9","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestone/9","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/9/labels","id":1441958,"number":9,"title":"3.6 Release","description":"More unit tests, running unit tests on Mac and Linux, SDL2 replacing OpenTK.","creator":{"login":"dellis1972","id":810617,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/810617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972","html_url":"https://github.com/dellis1972","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dellis1972/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":148,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-12-03T11:17:13Z","updated_at":"2017-08-21T16:42:53Z","due_on":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2017-03-09T08:22:27Z"},"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-04-02T04:20:12Z","updated_at":"2016-07-22T21:30:08Z","closed_at":"2016-07-22T21:30:08Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"We need to once and for all implement `DynamicSoundEffectInstance` across all platforms.\n\nThere was an effort 3 years ago that we were too dumb to get merged:  https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/pull/1982\n\nWe should use the ideas from it to help implement the feature for OpenAL and give the skeleton of the feature for XAudio platforms.\n\nNote how the unit tests were written for this.
