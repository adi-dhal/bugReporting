The bug is explained in that issue too, but I'll summarize here.\r\n\r\nIt comes down to that for OpenGL we cache vertex shader attributes based on a hash of the vertex shader, but when an attribute is not used in the current shader program the compiler will optimize it out and asking the location of that attribute will return -1. That value will be cached however and when another technique with the same vertex shader is later applied, the cached value of the location of that attribute will be fetched even though it might be used and does not actually have location -1. The fix I applied, as suggested by @ed022, is to hash based on the current program, i.e. a hash based on the hash of the vertex and pixel shader. I used the same hash that's used for caching shader programs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5385/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5384","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5384/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5384/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5384/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5384","id":198560246,"number":5384,"title":"Idea

However, I ran into problems with the Net namespace. In particular, issue #2211 and the realization that supporting multiple local gamers would be problematic caused me to rewrite the code from scratch.\r\n\r\nIn addition to implementing everything XNA supported (except host migration), I wrote a simple Master Server to support NetworkSessionType.PlayerMatch and NetworkSessionType.Ranked (ie. online modes).\r\n\r\nMy kart racer is not quire ready yet, so in order to demonstrate the code I compiled the NetRumble sample (provided to me by @dellis1972) using my Net implementation. I also deployed a master server (referencing the GUID of the NetRumble project) to an Azure VM so that we can play online with each other. Just notify me on the gitter chat if you want to play and I will join. Here is the executable: https://www.dropbox.com/s/u103ci1qosm1nd0/NetRumble.zip?dl=0\r\n\r\nThe master server is the only thing that is not standard XNA. The server itself is just a simple console application:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic static void Main(string[] args)\r\n{\r\n    NetworkSessionMasterServer server = new NetworkSessionMasterServer();\r\n\r\n    server.Start(\"e3ba2560-9fb5-4085-9c3a-b73fb4257f0e\");\r\n\r\n    while (!Console.KeyAvailable || Console.ReadKey().Key != ConsoleKey.Escape)\r\n    {\r\n        server.Update();\r\n\r\n        Thread.Sleep(10);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    server.Shutdown();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the NetRumble sample is modified so that it knows about the master server in the following way:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic static void Main (string[] args)\r\n{\r\n    // Set master server address before creating a NetworkSession:\r\n    NetworkSessionSettings.MasterServerAddress = \"13.81.113.129\";\r\n\r\n\tusing (var game = new NetRumbleGame ()) {\r\n\t\tgame.Run ();\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI updated the README to describe my fork but I don't know how to exclude it from this PR. Other than that, everything should be included in the PR.\r\n\r\nSo, what do you think? Here are my notes from the README:\r\n\r\n**This Fork**\r\n\r\nMy fork of MonoGame implements the Net namespace in order to compile networked games/apps that were built for XNA on any platform. I wanted to port my kart-racing game \"Seaside Racing\" to MonoGame and I decided to reimplement the Net namespace instead of rewriting the networking code in the game. The main reason to use the Net namespace for a new project is that the original API is very elegant, handles player management and lobby-to-game transitions. The implementation supports multiple backends and it should be straightforward to add support for new platforms. At the moment, the default backend uses the Lidgren library for low level networking tasks and the backend will work on any platform that supports standard .NET sockets.\r\n\r\n**Implementation details**\r\n\r\nSince a user can choose to use any network topology for their game, the internal implementation uses a peer-to-peer topology as it is the most general case. If the user wants a client/server topology, all traffic can be routed through the designated host or any other peer. This is inline with the original XNA implementation.\r\n\r\nThe peer that starts a game using the NetworkSession.Create() method becomes the host of the game. The host of the game broadcasts its existence to the master server (if NetworkSessionType is PlayerMatch or Ranked as opposed to Local or SystemLink) and responds to discovery requests. Any peer that connects to a host using the NetworkSession.Join() method becomes an ordinary peer. In the future, host migration could make it possible for ordinary peers to become hosts, but it is not implemented yet.\r\n\r\nThe master server is responsible for introducing (ie. finding the endpoint and performing NAT punchthrough) a peer to a host of an online game. Once connected to a host, the peer is introduced to the other peers already in the game by the host. Peers only allow introductions/connections from other peers whose endpoints are specified in an allowlist and only allow changes to the allowlist from the host. Once fully connected, the signed in gamers of the peer are able to join. This procedure ensures that all peers in a game are fully connected to each other in order to support a true peer-to-peer topology.\r\n\r\nThe session state is synchronized across all peers. Each signed in gamer that enters a game gets its own unique id that is synchronized across all peers. Incoming messages from unknown gamers are delayed until the gamer in question joins the game on the local machine, which is important because user messages do not need to be ordered and may arrive before the internal gamer join message.\r\n\r\nOverall, there are 2 caveats of the implementation that users must be aware of:\r\n\r\n* A peer cannot be behind the same router as the master server since the master server must know the external endpoint of the peer\r\n* A peer cannot be behind the same router as the host since the host must know the external endpoint of the peer\r\n\r\nIn practice, the only problem is that gamers behind the same router will not be able to connect to each other if any of them are designated the host.\r\n\r\n**Future work (Not implemented)**\r\n\r\n* Clean up responsibility of internal messages vs Session\r\n* Host migration\r\n* Cheat

After adding the lock, I could no longer reproduce this crash.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5375","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5375/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5375/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5375/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5375","id":197196485,"number":5375,"title":"Update ThirdParty/Dependencies to latest.","user":{"login":"KonajuGames","id":694943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/694943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames","html_url":"https://github.com/KonajuGames","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-12-22T15:17:16Z","updated_at":"2016-12-22T18:00:08Z","closed_at":"2016-12-22T18:00:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/5375","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5375","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5375.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/5375.patch"},"body":"Fixes a revert of the SDL version in a recent merge.\r\n\r\nFixes #5374","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5375/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5374","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5374/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5374/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5374/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5374","id":197147653,"number":5374,"title":"this.Window.AllowUserResizing = true; just got borked","user":{"login":"willmotil","id":7495196,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7495196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmotil","html_url":"https://github.com/willmotil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmotil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmotil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmotil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmotil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmotil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmotil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmotil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmotil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmotil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-12-22T10:51:10Z","updated_at":"2016-12-22T18:00:08Z","closed_at":"2016-12-22T18:00:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Just downloaded the nightly.

I tried enabling this feature on my machine, but when I did it actually showed 2715x1527 as an available mode.
