I've struggled with this for like 4 years now, and it seems that people on the web have hundreds of hacky work arounds to make this all work.\n\nI was wondering if you would consider an addition like this which would greatly simplify making editors and other monogame embedded applications.  Given the small changes, it makes it possible for me to do use a Custom User Control and have Monogame render to that instead of to the hard coded WinFormsGameForm.  Controls will still work, mouse and everything.  Sample code below.\n\n```\n        private void Control_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)\n        {\n            if (this.DesignMode == false)\n            {\n                WindowsDeviceConfig.UseForm = false;\n                WindowsDeviceConfig.ControlToUse = this;\n\n                MyGame game = new MyGame();\n                game.IsFixedTimeStep = false;\n\n                Thread t = new Thread(new ThreadStart(() =>\n                {\n                    while (true)\n                    {\n                        this.Invoke(new MethodInvoker(() =>\n

For example, things like SpriteEffects are functional in the rewrite, in addition to origin/rotation:\n\nhttp://flibitijibibo.com/images/spriteFontFlip.png\n\nThere are probably various little things that can be improved (pixel-perfect character placement using the cropping/kerning info may be one?), but what's keeping this from going into our mainline, primarily, is the CPU-bound performance... I describe it in a bit more detail in the issue, but the TL;DR is that the additional accuracy we provide probably shouldn't be making certain operations almost twice as slow.\n\nI don't know how useful this will be for MonoGame as a whole, as I don't know what limitations there might be for every target (for instance, whether or not every target can use VertexBuffer/IndexBuffer), but I thought some of it might be of some use to this project as well.

I'll issue a separate PR for switching `MacGamePlatform` to `OpenTKGamePlatform`, as that is much more invasive change and should be reviewed separately.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2842/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2841","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2841/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2841/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2841/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2841","id":38375584,"number":2841,"title":"non-static GraphicsCapabilities","user":{"login":"nkast","id":3018589,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3018589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast","html_url":"https://github.com/nkast","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2014-07-22T07:31:47Z","updated_at":"2014-07-31T15:52:11Z","closed_at":"2014-07-31T00:32:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/2841","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2841","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2841.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2841.patch"},"body":"Each GraphicsDevice have it's own instance of GraphicsCapabilities.
