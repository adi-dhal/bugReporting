This worked absolutely fine under DirectX, but when running under OpenGL (on Mac, Linux or Android), I got seemingly random graphics corruption, like the following (but it could be much worse, with the back-buffer just containing random parts of the desktop):\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/504826/12111520/1031e684-b3ea-11e5-8c8a-2d9671bd0aa1.png)\n\nThis stumped me for ages, before someone suggested that the depth buffer was not being cleared.  In hindsight this makes sense - without the depth buffer being cleared, then OpenGL will leave it containing random garbage until it's written to after the back-buffer is initialized.  But nothing will pass the depth test to write to it because it's never been cleared.\n\nDirectX does this by default and implicitly for you; the original code works fine on Windows.  However, I had to add right at the very start of my Draw loop, code like this:\n\n``` csharp\nrenderContext.GraphicsDevice.Clear(\n    ClearOptions.DepthBuffer, \n    Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Color.Transparent, \n    renderContext.GraphicsDevice.Viewport.MaxDepth,\n    0);\n```\n\nOnce I did that, OpenGL started working across all platforms again:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/504826/12111584/8a28e2a8-b3ea-11e5-86eb-606efcd383c9.png)\n\nI believe for correctness sake, and for the purpose of making things work more correctly cross-platform out-of-the-box, MonoGame should implicitly perform this call for the developer.\n\nWhat I'm not sure yet is whether this is just something we should do after initializing the back-buffer, or whether we need to do every frame.  I'd prefer a solution that was just the former in case the developer does want to preserve the depth buffer across frames (but obviously their game won't work under DirectX in that case).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4386/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4385","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4385/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4385/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4385/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4385","id":124924545,"number":4385,"title":"Fixes
