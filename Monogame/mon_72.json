I twice checked it and decided that is bug in monogame. Bug in setting textures to sampler states.\nThis bugs are already described in monogame issues. You wrote that you are fixed them, but some people still have them occuring.\nI tried to reduce my pixel shader code to somehow help identify this bug.\nFor example:\n\n```\ntexture Texture;\nsampler SecondSampler = sampler_state\n{\n    Texture = (Texture);\n};\n\nsampler TextureSampler : register(s0);\n\nfloat4 main(float4 position : SV_POSITION0, float4 color : COLOR0, float2 texCoord : TEXCOORD0) : COLOR0\n{\n    return tex2D(SecondSampler, texCoord) * 0.5f + tex2D(TextureSampler, texCoord) * 0.5f;\n}\n\ntechnique ShaderTechnique\n{\n    pass DefaultPass\n    {\n        PixelShader = compile ps_4_0_level_9_1 main();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSo I doing this\n\n``` C#\neffect.Parameters[\"Texture\"].SetValue(secondTexture);\nspriteBatch.Begin(SpriteSortMode.BackToFront, BlendState.AlphaBlend, SamplerState.PointWrap, null, null, effect);\n            {\n                spriteBatch.Draw(firstTexture, position, Color.White);\n            }\nspriteBatch.End();\n```\n\nAs I expect, this should draw both textures half-transparent on same place, both textures must be visible. But only firstTexture are visible half-transparent, secondTexture is not drawn at all.\nButi if I write in shader not this\n\n```\nreturn tex2D(SecondSampler, texCoord) * 0.5f + tex2D(TextureSampler, texCoord) * 0.5f;\n```\n\nbut this\n\n```\nreturn tex2D(TextureSampler, texCoord) * 0.5f +  tex2D(SecondSampler, texCoord) * 0.5f;\n```\n\nthen it works as I expected.\nMaybe I don't understand something, and (a+b) != (b+a) for float4 types, but I hope this can be helpful for fixing bug.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3854","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3854/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3854/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3854/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3854","id":76783884,"number":3854,"title":"Add GraphicsCapabilities.SupportsVertexTextures","user":{"login":"tgjones","id":102049,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/102049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones","html_url":"https://github.com/tgjones","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-05-15T16:43:10Z","updated_at":"2016-01-19T15:32:46Z","closed_at":"2015-05-16T21:56:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/3854","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3854","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3854.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3854.patch"},"body":"and use it to guard against applying vertex textures on devices that don't support them.

few points:\n- I'm using MonoGame 3.4\n- My keyboard layout is AZERTY\n- I have checked my language and keyboard settings on my computer and everything is correct\n\nThe problem I'm having is that the OpenGL versions of MonoGame seems to ignore the keyboard layout.\n\nI created a little piece of testing code which is:\n\n``` C#\n/// <summary>\n/// This is called when the game should draw itself.\n/// </summary>\n/// <param name=\"gameTime\">Provides a snapshot of timing values.</param>\nprotected override void Draw(GameTime gameTime)\n{\n    // Testing fields\n    Color clearColor = Color.MonoGameOrange;\n    KeyboardState keyboardState = Keyboard.GetState();\n\n    if (keyboardState.IsKeyDown(Keys.Escape))\n        Exit();\n\n    // Testing code\n    if (keyboardState.IsKeyDown(Keys.A))\n        clearColor = Color.Black;\n    else if (keyboardState.IsKeyDown(Keys.Q))\n        clearColor = Color.White;\n\n    // Show the clearColor\n    GraphicsDevice.Clear(clearColor);\n\n    base.Draw(gameTime);\n}\n```\n\nWhen I'm pressing the A key the screen turns white and when I'm pressing the Q key the screen turns black. It should be inversed. \nWhen debugging I saw that MonoGame thinks I have a QWERTY keyboard when in fact I have an AZERTY keyboard. But the GameWindow.TextInput event does not suffer from this error. It gives the correct characters.\nWhen testing this piece of code on the WindowsDX version everything worked just as it should, no problems.\n\nThankyou for the work you guys are doing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3835","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3835/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3835/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3835/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3835","id":75240907,"number":3835,"title":"Merge
