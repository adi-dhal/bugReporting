PR fixes the XAct volume implementation.\n- XAct sounds are no longer affected by `SoundEffect.MasterVolume`.\n- XAct sounds can have a volume greater than 1.0.\n- XAct sounds better obey the `AudioCategory.Volume`.\n\nTo do this I had to remove support for XAudio2 using the mastering voice to set the `SoundEffect.MasterVolume`.  Instead it works like all the other platforms and updates the volume on each `SoundEffectInstance` when the `SoundEffect.MasterVolume` changes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2890/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2889","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2889/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2889/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2889/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2889","id":39564996,"number":2889,"title":"MGFX v5 Compatibility","user":{"login":"flibitijibibo","id":1396814,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1396814?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo","html_url":"https://github.com/flibitijibibo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flibitijibibo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-08-05T21:03:10Z","updated_at":"2016-01-29T23:28:45Z","closed_at":"2016-01-29T23:28:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"To keep compatibility with the old shaders in my ports, I added this block of code...\n\nhttps://github.com/flibitijibibo/MonoGame/commit/8932d4ab6435b6e67c5818f3cf98e880de5f212d\n\n... but was not sure if this was something the original project wanted (I'm only doing this to put off extra work before I rewrite the Effect subsystem for FNA, to be honest).

How this could be made fool-proof? The problem is how we detect overlap, we need an event to mark the point of data no longer in use, maybe inside `Update()`, assuming that nobody is storing past `GetState()` results between frames.\n\nWe can encapsulate this buffer into a new class, say `CircularBuffer<T>():IList<T>` to make the code clear. This list will check for overlap and resize it's buffer when necessary. Allow a limited set of Stack/Queue-like operations like Add()/Remove() last, and random access GetAt()/this[].  \nThis list can have a `Clear()` method that returns a `ReadOnlyCircularBuffer<T>()` struct. The returned read only list will have the content so far while the list now is moved to a new offset.\nThe read only list will be used to populate the `TouchCollection`, which can be revert mostly back to it's original form.\n\nIn the long run, we can replace `_touchState` with this new list. Methods that manipulate the list need to be rewritten. For example, `AgeTouches()` will receive the Read-Only copy of touchLocations and the Cleared list. Instead of Removing elements from `touchState` it will Add elements to the output list by moving them from the Read-Only input list. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2876/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2875","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2875/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2875/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2875/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2875","id":39392452,"number":2875,"title":"Unit Test Image Comparision Improvements","user":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-08-04T05:53:31Z","updated_at":"2014-08-04T21:01:47Z","closed_at":"2014-08-04T06:07:51Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/2875","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2875","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2875.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2875.patch"},"body":"This PR improves the image comparison we use in the unit tests to be a little more forgiving.
