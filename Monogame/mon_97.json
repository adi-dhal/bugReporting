Using XNA this resulted in a strange color bugs. E.g. pixel (381,631) which has rgba(14,9,7,23) in the png had rgba(11,11,11,23) in the texture. I tried Monogame's OpenGL Windows implementation and got the same results.\n\nAfter looking deeper into this i found that there seems to be a problem in the ImageEx.RGBToBGR method. I have no idea why, but not using RGBToBGR and instead exchanging red and blue manually in the data-array (Texture2D.OpenGL.cs line #348) did the trick.\n\nHere is my workaround. Starting line #330 in Texture2D.OpenGL.cs:\n\n``` c#\n#if WINDOWS || LINUX || ANGLE\nBitmap image = (Bitmap)Bitmap.FromStream(stream);\ntry\n{\n    // Fix up the Image to match the expected format\n    image = (Bitmap)image.RGBToBGR();\n    var data = new byte[image.Width * image.Height * 4];\n    BitmapData bitmapData = image.LockBits(new System.Drawing.Rectangle(0, 0, image.Width, image.Height),\n    ImageLockMode.ReadOnly, System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat.Format32bppArgb);\n    if (bitmapData.Stride != image.Width * 4)\n    throw new NotImplementedException();\n    Marshal.Copy(bitmapData.Scan0, data, 0, data.Length);\n    image.UnlockBits(bitmapData);\n    Texture2D texture = null;\n    texture = new Texture2D(graphicsDevice, image.Width, image.Height);\n    for (int i = 0; i < data.Length; i+=4)\n    {\n        byte temp = data[i+0];\n        data[i + 0] = data[i + 2];\n        data[i + 2] = temp;\n    }\n    texture.SetData(data);\n    return texture;\n}\nfinally\n{\n    image.Dispose();\n}\n#endif\n```\n\nCheers, Martin\n\nSee also: http://community.monogame.net/t/texture2d-fromsteam-strange-behaviour-when-loading-png/1326\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3107/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3106","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3106/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3106/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3106/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3106","id":46230672,"number":3106,"title":"Orientation Issue on Kindle Fire HD 6","user":{"login":"jakepoz","id":392417,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/392417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakepoz","html_url":"https://github.com/jakepoz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakepoz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakepoz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakepoz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakepoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakepoz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakepoz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakepoz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakepoz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakepoz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-10-20T04:29:02Z","updated_at":"2014-10-20T04:38:17Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We are seeing an issue on the Kindle Fire HD 6, where a Monogame based game is not performing orientation changes correctly.

I have set the game orientation to sensor landscape. While it first appeared fine, I noticed that if I press the home button and then re-enter the app, the draw area gets squashed into about half the length of the screen. The 'fix' was to flip around the phone so to refresh the orientation which caused the game to render correctly again, but this didn't always work and sometimes it would just remain stuck like that (screenshot attached). Any ideas how to fix this?\n\nIn Activity1.cs\n\nLaunchMode = Android.Content.PM.LaunchMode.SingleTask\nScreenOrientation = ScreenOrientation.SensorLandscape\n\nAnd in Game1.cs\n\n_graphics.SupportedOrientations = DisplayOrientation.LandscapeLeft | DisplayOrientation.LandscapeRight;\n\nI am guessing that MonoGame has made the game turn into portrait mode since as you can see in the screenshot, many UI elements are not visible and the wide play button is squashed. The visible part is the bottom half of the UI and the upper is offscreen. So basically this is portrait orientation in a sideways fashion...\n\n![564815171c_669x500](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3251763/4690632/baaa8136-56f1-11e4-8ce8-8273b3d0becc.JPG)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3099","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3099/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3099/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3099/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3099","id":46122116,"number":3099,"title":"Remove GC.Collect() when receiving memory warnings","user":{"login":"prollin","id":502478,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/502478?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin","html_url":"https://github.com/prollin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-10-17T17:12:43Z","updated_at":"2014-10-18T05:53:17Z","closed_at":"2014-10-17T18:07:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/3099","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3099","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3099.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3099.patch"},"body":"As stated in the comment, this is not MonoGame's job.

seems to be a problem that was addressed at some point, because there are discussions about it dating back to 2012, but is still prominent.\n\nWhenever the player presses the home button, the game cannot be resumed.  More technically, any time the game goes through OnPause() and OnResume(), a blank screen is left. \nThis interferes with App Switching, trying to show interstitial ads, and In-App Purchases.\n\nI have created a GitHup repo illustrating this issue that can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/mrEmo/ProblemGame/tree/master\n\nI have also posted on StackOverflow since I do not know how to solve this problem. The question is here:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/26370468/monogame-android-cant-resume-game-blank-screen\n\nAlso, in the community forums:\nhttp://community.monogame.net/t/monogame-onresume-bug-cant-resume-properly-gl-invalid-operation/1298\n\nIf there is anything I can do, let me know.
