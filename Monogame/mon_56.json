guys.\n\nI was just wondering if a PR for adding the `<MonoGamePlatform>` and `<Import>` elements to the project files automatically is something that I could do? Each time I install MonoGame into a new project, I have to manually edit the files and add it. Not too hard, but very annoying. We can do this automatically without any strange scripts and things. \n\nBasically, according to the [docs](http://docs.nuget.org/create/Creating-and-Publishing-a-Package#import-msbuild-targets-and-props-files-into-project), we can add a `.props` file that adds the `<MonoGamePlatform>` element based on the NuGet installed. As each NuGet has a single platform, there will be no confusion. Then, we just add the `.targets` file to the NuGet and it will automatically be referenced.\n\nI have done this with several projects, and is very useful. It works in Visual Studio, Xamarin Studio/MonoDevelop. If anything fails, such as some random IDE, it can still be added manually.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4315","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4315/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4315/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4315/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4315","id":121845387,"number":4315,"title":"EffectParameter.Setvalue(int[]) not implemented","user":{"login":"JustinKerbice","id":6765559,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6765559?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinKerbice","html_url":"https://github.com/JustinKerbice","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinKerbice/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinKerbice/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinKerbice/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinKerbice/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinKerbice/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinKerbice/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinKerbice/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinKerbice/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JustinKerbice/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-12-12T09:36:32Z","updated_at":"2015-12-14T16:00:28Z","closed_at":"2015-12-14T16:00:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The [method](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb198903%28v=xnagamestudio.40%29.aspx) from XNA 4.0 is not yet implemented in MonoGame.\n(instead there  is thecommented block:\n`/*\n        public void SetValue (int[] value)\n        {\n            throw new NotImplementedException();\n        }\n        */` )\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4315/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4314","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4314/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4314/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4314/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4314","id":121821946,"number":4314,"title":"Windows GL gives Song not a wave file error.","user":{"login":"lionelthomas","id":16195508,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/16195508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lionelthomas","html_url":"https://github.com/lionelthomas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lionelthomas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lionelthomas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lionelthomas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lionelthomas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lionelthomas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lionelthomas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lionelthomas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lionelthomas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lionelthomas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2015-12-12T01:03:29Z","updated_at":"2015-12-18T20:20:32Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"This code works in Windows version:\n songs = new Dictionary<string, XSong>();\n for (int i = 0;

am proposing the full removal of the existing storage classes:\n- [StorageContainer.cs](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/Storage/StorageContainer.cs)\n- [StorageDevice.cs](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/Storage/StorageDevice.cs)\n- [StorageDeviceHelper.cs](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/Storage/StorageDeviceHelper.cs)\n\nBack in https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/issues/2389 I was suggesting redesign, but really after seeing more console SDKs and how each one uses a different method for storage (as well as different TRC requirements)...  it seems better to just drop support for this old API entirely.\n\nThen at a later date if we can work out something that works in all cases we can talk about adding a new API.\n\nSo is anyone using this functionality?  Would it be missed at all?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4310","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4310/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4310/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4310/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4310","id":121219241,"number":4310,"title":"Default SetConstantBuffers","user":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-12-09T11:48:22Z","updated_at":"2015-12-09T13:42:49Z","closed_at":"2015-12-09T13:42:49Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/4310","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4310","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4310.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4310.patch"},"body":"Fixed `SetConstantBuffers` to have a default path without any extra arguments.
