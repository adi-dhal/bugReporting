is a refactor of the dispose pattern across all the `GraphicsResource` objects.\n\nThe main change is the replacement of the `PlatformDispose()` with the normal virtual `Dispose(bool)` method.  This caused problems in heavily overloaded classes like Texture/Texture2D/RenderTarget2D where it was not possible for all three classes to have their own dispose implementations.  By only depending on `Dispose(bool)` any class can overload the disposal behavior.\n\nThe rest was just fixes to where dispose was not implemented under DirectX.  This included `ConstantBuffer`, `DepthStencilState`, `RasterizerState`, `SamplerState`.\n\nNote I fell into the old #2191 trap while working on this and backtracked to correct myself.  That is a separate issue that still needs to be addressed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2413","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2413/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2413/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2413/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2413","id":32120856,"number":2413,"title":"AllowAltF4 - bug fix","user":{"login":"Chaosus","id":3036176,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3036176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus","html_url":"https://github.com/Chaosus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaosus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-04-24T05:13:53Z","updated_at":"2014-07-10T22:42:52Z","closed_at":"2014-04-24T08:22:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/2413","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2413","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2413.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2413.patch"},"body":"AllowAltF4 seems not worked completely correctly on WindowsDX platform - this would fix it and will equate its behaviour to WindowsGL version.

It also implements support for `PresentInterval`.\n\nThe involves two changes:\n1. Context construction (foreground and background) is moved from `OpenTKGameWindow` to `GraphicsDevice.OpenGL`. This is required because:\n   - `GraphicsDevice.PresentationParameters` are not yet available when the `GameWindow` is initialized \n   - both foreground and background contexts must have the same pixel format, or context sharing will fail\n   - it is a good idea in general, because context construction is an extremely heavy operation (e.g. up to 1sec on my rmbp because it has to power up the discrete GPU) - non-graphical applications should not pay this cost.\n2. The desired `PresentationParameters` are translated to OpenGL attributes and passed to the context constructor.\n\n`PresentInterval.Immediate`, `One` and `Two` are mapped to OpenGL swap intervals of 0, 1 and 2, respectively (see [EXT_swap_control](http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/swap_control.txt)). `PresentInterval.Default` is mapped to OpenGL swap interval -1, which enables adaptive vsync if [EXT_swap_control_tear](http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/wgl_swap_control_tear.txt) is supported - if not, OpenTK falls back to regular vsync instead.\n\nNote that this PR is for the backbuffer only (aka default framebuffer).
