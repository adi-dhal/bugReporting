The process goes well and MonoGame looks very good but I have faced some issues. I will create 1 bug per issue.\n\nMonoGame 3.3.0.2238\n<b>Issue 1: ModelMesh.Tag ignored in ContentManager.Load<Model>()</b>\nI have custom model processor which uses Model.Tag, ModelMesh.Tag and ModelMeshPart.Tag properties to store custom data. In ContentMagager.Load<Model>(), Model.Tag and ModelMeshPart.Tag are loaded just fine but ModelMesh.Tag is simply ignored. Currently I use simple workaround storing ModelMesh.Tag data in the ModelMeshPart.Tag but honestly I do not see any point to ignore MedelMesh.Tag property and I think that is a bug.\n\nThere are \nmodelMeshPart.Tag = reader.ReadObject<object>();\nand\nmodel.Tag = reader.ReadObject<object>();\nassignments in the\nModelReader : ContentTypeReader\nclass but there is no such assignment for the ModelMesh.Tag property.\n\nThank you!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3648","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3648/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3648/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3648/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3648","id":63462704,"number":3648,"title":"Updated

We could throw an runtime exception if you try to use a comparison sampler. But I guess that is for the future - MG doesn't really use graphics profiles much yet, and whether it should or not is a whole separate discussion.\n\n(This will conflict with my other PR, #3626 -
