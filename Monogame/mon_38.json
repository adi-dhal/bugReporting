I recently started a thread on the forums here:\n\nhttp://community.monogame.net/t/custom-content-pipeline-serialization-issues-in-windows-10/7665/3\n\nI finally tracked the issue down to this line of code: https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/Content/ContentExtensions.cs#L37\n\nIt looks like it's trying to filter out properties on the object that have been hidden using the \"new\" keyword in C#. Unfortunately, the trick of checking if the GetMethods for the properties are reference equal doesn't seem to work using the .NET Native toolchain. In general, this doesn’t feel like a great way to make this check. The result is that most custom content loads up with blank or null values, which causes crashes elsewhere. \n\nFor my game, I just commented out that line and everything works fine. I don't do any property hiding, although I'm not sure if things would break outright even if I did. Regardless, I spent some time investigating fixes to the problem and it turns out .NET doesn't really have a great way to determine if one property is hiding another in a base class. Especially in the RT environment where reflection is limited. If possible, it seems like it might be best to not do this check at all. I’m not sure what, if anything, was actually breaking downstream before this check existed. Like I said, my project works fine without it. \n\nTo find out why this code exists in the first place, I tried to track down the original commit, but haven't had much luck. I think there have been some git history rewrite shenanigans going on. You can see that in this commit (https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/commit/560741319e82c396049def24e2fdaa32d39e58cf) the logic was moved from ReflectiveReader.cs to ContentExtensions.cs. \n\nBut if you go through the history of ReflectiveReader.cs, you won't see that commit. Also, I can't find any trace of the property hiding check ever having been in that file. Instead you can see the changed seems to have happened between this commit (https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/commit/b940c0d9a289f191e08a17137c06290ebb4a18a2) and this commit (https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/commit/c99103b5e435a15fa24b0ea89f9bf4b2261f35a9)\n\nTLDR; \nThe check for property hiding is sketchball and breaks .NET Native apps. .NET doesn’t provide a great way to check for this at all. Maybe you should kill it altogether. \n\nPS: The GetAllProperties() and GetAllFields() functions are misnamed. They both get very restrictive sets of properties/fields.

In that case, the stencil test would not be reset to its original state (the one before the rendertarget gets resolved).\n\nThe fix is very simple and explicit: it tests the value of the last **applied** stencil state and only disable it if necessary, and reenable it right after if it was previously enabled.\n\nDespite being the original author of the multisampling code, I have no idea why it wasn't done this way in the first place. Apologies if this sneaky bug caused you as much pain as it did for us :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4862","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4862/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4862/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4862/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4862","id":155709890,"number":4862,"title":"Testing Texture2D.SetData","user":{"login":"Tzenchor","id":11319966,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/11319966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tzenchor","html_url":"https://github.com/Tzenchor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tzenchor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tzenchor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tzenchor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tzenchor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tzenchor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tzenchor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tzenchor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tzenchor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tzenchor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2016-05-19T11:01:12Z","updated_at":"2016-09-05T15:26:30Z","closed_at":"2016-07-02T15:07:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/4862","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4862","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4862.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4862.patch"},"body":"Related to #1455.\nAt this time I have implemented some tests for `Texture2D.SetData()` with 1 and 3 parameters, the other overloads will come later.
