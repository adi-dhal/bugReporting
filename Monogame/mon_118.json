With arguments as to why below them.\n\n1) A overload that takes a starting and ending character position, for the DrawString method specifically the one that takes a StringBuilder.\n\n2) GetMaxFontCharacterLineHeight ( with a scaling parameter as well)\n   (this would relate to a character with the largest pixel height in a spritefont\n    im unsure and its not clear that a measure string will return this )\n\n3) Couple overloads for MeasureString that allows you to pass a scaling factor \n    and or specify a part of a stringbuilder to measure.\n\n**why**\n\nThis should be there because when drawing scaled text. \nYou cannot measure properly, the scaled text you will be drawing with a Drawstring call...\nThat makes use of the scaling parameter.\nAt least not without basically re-doing everything mono-game just did ...yourself.\n\nEven the basic recalculation of the pixel width height from a scaling requires a few steps. That is very hard for a new person to figure out. \nIt is also inefficient and difficult to do so effectively from outside the inner-working's of mono game itself. Which basically goe's thru all the required steps anyways, in Spritefont and Spritebatch.\nSo i think it should be part of the inner workings of mono-game in either case.\n\n_i was going to petition shawn hargraves about this for xna 5 but you know how that goes.._\n\nTo add to this i will offer some scenario's, general and specific towards the implementation bonus's.\n\n**possible scenario's case's that could then easily be created by programers using mono game**\n\nText That need not have a new or altered string or StringBuilder Instance for a drawn effect like scrolling and is efficient \n(strings resizing operations being one of the worst gc collection case senario's)\nRescaling text to fit a rectangular area.\nText rectangles drawn over image rectangles, (user made buttons with effects)\nText that scrolls up down as well as left right (though it maybe more work). \nDelimiting text to user designated text area's such as scalable text boxes, chat boxes ect.\nMeasurement of text for proportional screen scaling, \nindependent of the screen resolution i.e.  ...\n(text could be made to maintain proportion to a percentage of the screen under virtual coordinates if so desired)\n\n**possible scenarios for extension's or extra's using the above**\n\nThe user wishes to create a overloaded drawstring, that takes a rectangle instead of a vector2 \nThe rectangle will delimit the text so that the text will not draw characters that will exceed the width and height in pixels of the rectangle area.\n\nthe user wishes to have data in a small box when he move's his mouse over it ,... it expands to the full text this can then be done by simply using one drawstring call or the other and a collision box\n\nim sure their are more. these are only some i have considered.\ni can elaborate on the steps if desired\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2479/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2478","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2478/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2478/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2478/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2478","id":32857606,"number":2478,"title":"MGCB

A cursor left or above the window has negative coordinates.\n2. Mouse coordinates are reported in integer pixels. The resolution of the mouse is limited by the resolution of the monitor (typically 96dpi.)\n3. Pointer ballistics are always applied. There is no option to disable mouse acceleration. \n4. The mouse is not restricted to the `GameWindow`. Users can freely move the cursor outside the window and focus different applications. The state of the cursor can be queried even if the `GameWindow` does not have focus.\n5. The mouse is restricted by the desktop rectangle. Once the mouse reaches a desktop edge, it will no longer report movement in that direction. Infinite (relative) motion can only be achieved by calling `Mouse.SetPosition` to reset the mouse position.\n6. By default, the mouse cursor is invisible inside the `GameWindow`. This can be changed by setting `Game.IsCursorVisible` to true. Using a custom mouse cursor is _not_ supported.\n7. `Mouse.SetPosition` does not appear to move the actual cursor, only change its logical position. If the `GameWindow` has focus, `SetPosition` works everywhere on screen. Otherwise, it only works if the cursor lies within the `GameWindow` bounds.\n\nJudging from the above, it appears that `Mouse.GetState` is a thin wrapper around the `GetCursorPos` Windows API. I must admit I find this somewhat surprising, as points 2 and 3 are usually considered a deal-breaker for specific kinds of games, notably first-person shooters.\n\nPoint 3 has the additional disadvantage that pointer ballistics differ significantly between operating systems. A mouse control scheme tuned to work on Windows will feel awkward on Mac OS X and vice versa.\n\nEdit: users can set `Mouse.WindowHandle` to a different window in order to change the origin of the coordinate system. It is unlikely that this can be implemented in a cross-platform fashion, so I am ignoring this property in my tests.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2463","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2463/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2463/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2463/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2463","id":32677564,"number":2463,"title":"(RFC) Add a progress bar to asset reloading","user":{"login":"KakCAT","id":2372854,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2372854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT","html_url":"https://github.com/KakCAT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KakCAT/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2014-05-02T09:02:22Z","updated_at":"2016-04-02T13:39:50Z","closed_at":"2016-04-02T13:39:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi!\n\nreloading assets can take a lot of time on some android devices, so to avoid the user thinking that the reloading screen is frozen, I tried to add a progress bar.\n\nHowever I'm not good at following other people's style and my API design knowledge stinks :) Here is my approach:\n\nhttp://pastebin.com/Kzy48Aqr\n\nfirst two blocks are new code, and ReloadGraphicAssets is slightly modified to set and increment the variables.\n\nAny suggestions?
