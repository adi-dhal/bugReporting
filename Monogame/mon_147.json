I don't think having one folder per-platform is clean up or will simplify management in any way.\n Fair enough this just seemed to make sense but if you don't like it (as I did with @slygamer 's comments I can change it. It's not a big thing, just moving the .csproj files which are currently the only files in those folders back into their original location\n\n2: Build folders in central location\n Again if you feel this is a step too far, I can roll it back not a big deal\n\n3: with regards to the effect files these are NOT new, they were effect resource files which were located in the PSM folder, every other project has them in one location so it was simply tidied up. Again if you feel this is a separate PR to the core split they can be left back where they were.\n\n4: DataCOntract usage on other platforms, since the files using these are now using those classes from the PCL, it's the PCL that supports DataContract and not the platform. In all the platforms I could test on both in MonoGame and other projects this has never caused an issue.\n\n *Note only DataContract is supported in a PCL, serialisable is not.\n Again if you feel this is a step too far we can strip out all of those classes from core too.\n\n5: Assembly naming. before I make any further changes there can we agree on which assembly is going to get called what. Is the core going to be called \"MonoGame.Framework\" or \"MonoGame.Framework.Core\" and what about the project libs. Can we get a consensus from the core group before I change it again.\n\nAs i've said all along to @tomspilman and @dellis1972 , I have no agenda here other than to help\n\nAs for the Branch I was committing from, I think this was just a misunderstanding on my part from the instructions Tom, I was under the belief I had to merge changes in my own development branch and then merge with develop before submitting the pull request on my develop branch. I see now this was incorrect and will drop this pull request and resubmit a new one once the above clarifications have been worked out.\n\nUp to you guys, if you want one solution split and submitted with the agreed assembly naming, or all the projects that i've already split. Leaving the others later may cause issue as several commits have been pushed in to develop that changes the landscape of each of the projects that have to be reanalysed each time to check what is core and what is project.\n\nI'll be sure to make more discrete changes in the future beyond the split\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1601/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1600","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1600/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1600/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1600/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/1600","id":12642311,"number":1600,"title":"First pass at implementing GetData for PSM.
