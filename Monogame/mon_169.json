I'm getting the following error when I try and just run the basic XNA Windows Game application in the Android emulator.  If I just create a new vanilla OpenGL Android For Mono Application that works fine though.  So the steps I'm following are:\n\nCreate a new solution, starting with a XNA Game Studio 4.0 - Windows Game (4.0) project.  Don't change it at all; if I run it I just get a window with a blue background.\n\nI then add a new OpenGL Android For Mono Application and set it as the startup project.  To this project I add the Lidgren.Network.Android (v2011.3.12.0), MonoGame.Framework.Android (v2.0.0.0 from the new v3.0 Beta download), and Tao.Sdl (v1.2.13.0) references.  I then do an Add As Link on the WindowsGame1's Game1.cs file.\n## Next I change the Activity1.cs file to this:\n\nusing System;\n\nusing Android.App;\nusing Android.Content;\nusing Android.Runtime;\nusing Android.Views;\nusing Android.Widget;\nusing Android.OS;\n\nnamespace OpenGLApplication1\n{\n    [Activity(Label = \"OpenGLApplication1\", MainLauncher = true, Icon = \"@drawable/icon\")]\n    public class Activity1 : Microsoft.Xna.Framework.AndroidGameActivity\n    {\n        GLView1 view;\n\n```\n    protected override void OnCreate(Bundle bundle)\n    {\n        base.OnCreate(bundle);\n\n        WindowsGame1.Game1.Activity = this;\n        var game = new WindowsGame1.Game1();\n        SetContentView(game.Window);\n        game.Run();\n    }\n}\n```\n## }\n## When I try and run the application in the Android emulator (API v14) I get an exception when it loads, with the following output to the debug window:\n\n11-04 21:03:12.780 W/monodroid-gc(  681): GREF GC Threshold: 1800\nLoaded assembly: /data/data/OpenGLApplication1.OpenGLApplication1/files/.**override**/OpenGLApplication1.dll\nLoaded assembly: /data/data/OpenGLApplication1.OpenGLApplication1/files/.**override**/MonoGame.Framework.Android.dll\nLoaded assembly: /data/data/OpenGLApplication1.OpenGLApplication1/files/.**override**/Lidgren.Network.Android.dll\nLoaded assembly: /data/data/OpenGLApplication1.OpenGLApplication1/files/.**override**/Tao.Sdl.dll\nLoaded assembly: Mono.Android.dll [External]\nLoaded assembly: System.Core.dll [External]\nLoaded assembly: MonoDroidConstructors [External]\nLoaded assembly: OpenTK.dll [External]\nLoaded assembly: System.dll [External]\nThread started: \nThread started: \n11-04 21:03:18.960 D/MonoGame(  681): AndroidGameWindow.CreateFrameBuffer\n11-04 21:03:19.060 D/libEGL  (  681): Emulator without GPU support detected.

Tom, \n\nThere is a bug we are seeing with the previous location code for TouchLocations. I know you didn't want to see a full rewrite of the touch code, so I will describe the issue here:\n\nThe bug we are seeing is that the previous location for all TouchLocations is always the same as the current location. This is because within each update loop of the game, TouchLocations save off their previous location twice, resulting in it simply being equal to the current location.\n\nIn TouchPanel.RefreshState, the first time around we call touch.UpdateState which updates the previous location. This sets the stateChanged flag, which then means we will go through the RefreshState one more time because of the loop in TouchPanel.GetState. In this second pass, we have no more events for that touch point, so touchEvent is false, and touch.AsMovedState is called. This also contains code which also saves off the previous location.\n\nI believe the previous location saving should only be in one place or the other.\n\nThis was tested on the Surface RT Windows 8.\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/926","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/926/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/926/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/926/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/926","id":8045628,"number":926,"title":"Issue similar to #916 Loading Effect Windows8","user":{"login":"NemoKradXNA","id":2579338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2579338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemoKradXNA","html_url":"https://github.com/NemoKradXNA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemoKradXNA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemoKradXNA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemoKradXNA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemoKradXNA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemoKradXNA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemoKradXNA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemoKradXNA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemoKradXNA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemoKradXNA/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7430385,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/Windows%2010%20UWP","name":"Windows 10 UWP","color":"d7e102","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":63,"created_at":"2012-11-01T22:30:05Z","updated_at":"2013-03-15T09:25:45Z","closed_at":"2013-03-15T08:01:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"OK, I am in the middle of porting my engine to MonoGame for Windows8, I really have not been too bright and have made a tonne of mistakes, but I am almost there, my source and libs build for MonoGame and I have created a Content builder and content project with my shaders in it and building those for Windows8 too, but I am getting the same issue as [SaintGimp](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/issues/916) when loading my shaders.\n\nMy engine uses deferred lighting and the first shader it's failing to load is using the following fxh file\n\n```\n#define MaxBones 59\n\nfloat2 halfPixel;\n\nstruct VertexShaderOutputToPS\n{\n    float4 Position : Position0;\n    float4 color : COLOR0;\n    float2 texCoord : TEXCOORD0;\n    float4 ScreenPosition : TEXCOORD1;\n};\n\nstruct PixelShaderOutput\n{\n    float4 Color    : COLOR0;
