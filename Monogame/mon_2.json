While the game runs fine, VideoPlayer lags to the point where the video is not only out of sync but often missable due to how many frames are dropped.\r\n\r\nNot sure what the issue is though, I did notice CPU usage going up a bit, memory seems to be going up constantly each time the video runs (sometimes crashing after a few times) and this happens on both desktop and laptop. My game normally sits around 100mb - 150mb range max but letting a video (even if it is the same one) play over and over again can increase the memory usage to around 1gb after a minute of testing.\r\n\r\nThis is being tested on a Windows DX project, both testing platforms running Windows 10.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5937/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5936","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5936/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5936/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5936/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5936","id":257527214,"number":5936,"title":"[Android] Black screen after splash screen and before game","user":{"login":"mrhelmut","id":3427451,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3427451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut","html_url":"https://github.com/mrhelmut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-09-13T21:29:11Z","updated_at":"2017-09-23T16:21:03Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Another one since #5410 :)\r\n\r\nThere is a black screen appearing after the splash screen and before the game runs.\r\n\r\nI haven't looked into this one yet.\r\n\r\n@dellis1972 @roponator ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5935","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5935/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5935/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5935/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/5935","id":257525566,"number":5935,"title":"[Android] Viewport size issues","user":{"login":"mrhelmut","id":3427451,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3427451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut","html_url":"https://github.com/mrhelmut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-09-13T21:22:37Z","updated_at":"2017-10-04T17:47:37Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Since #5410, I am running into ```GraphicsDevice.Viewport``` issues when using fullscreen or immersive mode.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the viewport is too small and offset'd by the size of the action bar.\r\n\r\nThis is because the initial ```Viewport``` size is based on ```CurrentDisplayMode```, which uses ```AndroidGameView.GameView.Width``` / ```Height```, while ```PreferredBackbufferWidth``` / ```Height``` gets their value from ```ClientBounds``` (set from ```Context.Resources.DisplayMetrics```).\r\n\r\nOn my device, ```AndroidGameView.GameView``` is 600x1024 while ```Context.Resources.DisplayMetrics``` is 600x976.\r\n\r\nI believe this is due to ```MonoAndroidGameView``` being created after the ```Context``` is queried for the display size and then returns values for non-fullscreen mode.
