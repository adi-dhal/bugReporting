If you have a windowed game and your cursor leaves the window it stops updating its relative coordinates.\n\nMouse state behaves different in MonoGame than XNA 4. I quickly checked that XNA it will happily provide you with relative coordinates that track your cursor outside of the window.  After digging through the source I believe this is because of WinFormsGameForm's method of handling mouse events. The events delegated through the Form's control's event handlers.  This leads to MouseMove not firing when the mouse is not over the control.\n\n[WinFormsGameWindow.cs](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/Windows/WinFormsGameWindow.cs#L184)\n\nThis could be solved by updating the [Mouse.GetState](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/Input/Mouse.cs#L128) to grab the real mouse location and translate it back into the relative position. \n\nI'll happily go create a separate feature branch to tackle that. Regardless being able to leverage the Form's cursor clip logic directly is heavily preferable than readjust the cursor back in bounds with a update loop's worth of delay.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2778/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2777","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2777/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2777/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2777/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2777","id":37129517,"number":2777,"title":"Support PSM SDK 2.0","user":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-07-03T22:31:16Z","updated_at":"2015-03-24T11:48:43Z","closed_at":"2015-03-24T11:48:43Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"We need to update the PSM platform to take advantage of PSM SDK 2.0 targeting PS Vita and PlayStation TV.

Which is where we move all the core render state and commands:\n\n```\npublic class GraphicsContext : IDisposable\n{\n   public RasterizerState RasterizerState;\n   public BlendState BlendState;\n   public DepthStencilState DepthStencilState;\n   public Rectangle ScissorRectangle;\n   public Viewport Viewport;\n\n   public void SetRenderTarget(...);\n   public void SetVertexBuffer(...);\n   public void SetIndexBuffer(...);\n\n   internal Shader VertexShader;\n   internal Shader PixelShader;\n\n   public void Clear(...);\n\n   public void DrawPrimitives(...);\n   public void DrawIndexedPrimitives(...);\n   public void DrawUserPrimitives(...);        \n}\n```\n\nThen we change `GraphicsDevice` to only have the per-device stuff and inherit from `GraphicsContext`...\n\n```\n    public class GraphicsDevice : GraphicsContext\n    {\n       public DisplayMode DisplayMode;\n       public PresentationParameters PresentationParameters;\n       public GraphicsProfile GraphicsProfile;\n\n       // Creates a deferred context for building command lists in parallel.\n       public GraphicsContext CreateContext();\n\n       // Submit commands from another context to be rendered by the GPU.\n       public void DrawContext(GraphicsContext context);\n\n       public void Present();\n    }\n```\n\nThis way to most users the MonoGame drawing API remains pretty identical to XNA4 except for this extra `GraphicsContext` base class in there.\n\nNext is what to do with all the `GraphicsResource` classes like `VertexBuffer`, `Texture2D`, `BlendState`, etc.  These all hold on to a `GraphicsDevice` internally for various reasons.\n\nIn the cases where they need to create resources on the \"GPU\" they should be using `GraphicsDevice` and this path either is or should be fixed to be thread safe.\n\nBut in the cases of actual rendering they need to know what `GraphicsContext` to apply themselves to.  Luckily most of the resources are applied to the device/context like so:\n\n```\ndeviceOrContext.BlendState = myBlendState;\ndeviceOrContext.SetVertexBuffer(myVertexBuffer);\ndeviceOrContext.Textures[0] = myTexture;\n```\n\nWe just need to fix the internal APIs to pass both the `GraphicsDevice` (for creating resources) and `GraphicsContext` (for state/rendering) ...  which in most cases could be the same object.\n\nThe bigger problem would be `Effect` which just does this:\n\n```\nmyEffect.CurrentTechnique.Passes[0].Apply();\n```\n\nIt internally sets the shaders, constant buffers, textures, samplers, and render states on to the `GraphicsDevice` it was passed at construction.  To fix this we will need a new overloaded method in `EffectPass`:\n\n```\npublic void Apply()\n{\n   Apply(GraphicsDevice);\n}\n\npublic void Apply(GraphicsContext context)\n{\n    context.VertextShader = _vertexShader;\n    context.PixelShader = _pixelShader;\n    context.RasterizerState = _rasterizerState;\n    context.BlendState = _blendState;\n    context.DepthStencilState = _depthStencilState;\n\n    // etc!\n}\n```\n\nThis then would require anyone using the multithreaded rendering features to be sure to call `EffectPass.Apply(GraphicsContext)`.\n\nThoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2772/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2771","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2771/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2771/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2771/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2771","id":36940824,"number":2771,"title":"Fixed

So it always calls a DeviceReset  and attempts to load the assets again. With the latest Xamarin.Android the bug that caused this issue is fixed. Two new methods have been introduced OnContextLost OnContextSet. \n\nOnContextLost is only called if the GL context is actually broken, when this method is called the context is dead completely. \n\nOnContextSet is only called when a context is created, this occurs on startup and only after the Context is actually lost. It is at this point what a valid context is available for loading textures and shaders. the normal Loaded method is called after this one.  \n\nThese changes set the Resuming flag in the OnContextLost method so we can reload the assets on startup. This will happen very rarely since the original bug where the context was lost when a app was paused is fixed in the Xamarin.Android OpenTK 0.9.9.3 and 1.0.0.0. With this fix android apps should resume without the need to reload textures or shaders.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2769/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2768","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2768/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2768/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2768/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2768","id":36880172,"number":2768,"title":"GetCue from SoundBank for a Cue that contains a Sound with multiple Tracks fails","user":{"login":"wldevries","id":1745610,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1745610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wldevries","html_url":"https://github.com/wldevries","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wldevries/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wldevries/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wldevries/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wldevries/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wldevries/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wldevries/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wldevries/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wldevries/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wldevries/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-07-01T10:31:36Z","updated_at":"2017-05-03T10:50:55Z","closed_at":"2017-05-02T19:46:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Create a `Sound` and add several `Wave`s to it.

For example:\n\n```\n    public static Vector2 operator /(Vector2 value1, float divider)\n    {\n        float factor = 1 / divider;\n        value1.X *= factor;\n        value1.Y *= factor;\n        return value1;\n    }\n```\n\nThis will modify value1 itself, since X and Y are public fields and thus are mutable. This is not just a bad programming practice. This is also very different from XNA, where same operator will return a new instance for result without changing the arguments.\n\nFor example in 'a = b / c' MonoGame will change b as well, but it should not!\n\nI don't feel entitled at all, but I am very, very surprised this is implemented like that. Could it please be changed to match XNA? I am fairly certain this is causing subtle bugs for a lot of people. The way I noticed it is when I was comparing \"before\" and \"after\" screenshots in my little physics engine. If you are using Farseer, then don't be surprised when something feels \"different\" after switching to MonoGame.\n\nI hope I am being stupid and misreading / misunderstanding something, please prove me wrong...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2751","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2751/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2751/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2751/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2751","id":36610156,"number":2751,"title":"Pipeline Docs","user":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-06-26T20:09:20Z","updated_at":"2014-07-11T04:36:37Z","closed_at":"2014-06-27T21:42:19Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/2751","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2751","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2751.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2751.patch"},"body":"Starting to add documentation for the Pipeline Tool.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2750","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2750/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2750/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/2750/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2750","id":36592130,"number":2750,"title":"openal-soft implementation for Android","user":{"login":"KonajuGames","id":694943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/694943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames","html_url":"https://github.com/KonajuGames","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonajuGames/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":30,"created_at":"2014-06-26T16:30:19Z","updated_at":"2014-08-21T05:35:58Z","closed_at":"2014-07-02T21:58:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/2750","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2750","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2750.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/2750.patch"},"body":"Uses the same OpenAL code as most other supported MonoGame platforms.\nSupports low latency sound on Android v4.2 and above.
