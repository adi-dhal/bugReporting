Couldn't this be better handled by examining which objects are IDisposable in the LoadedAssets dictionary before it is cleared in Unload()?\n\nIn general I think the ContentManager could stand to have some improvements in functionality. If I were using XNA I'd be in a pickle since it's not really compatible with my simple case where assets need to be independently loaded and garbage collected rather than being managed by a ContentManager.

I think i've discovered a \"strange\" bug.

The problem occours only when your texture \"ends\" with opaque white color (it works with black, haven't tried with other colors) I attach a simple image that cause the error.  This error could be related on how the Pipeline editor creates xnbs OR it is an Android BUG: For eg. If I add .xnb file extension into the \"Leave the following resource extensions uncompressed\" option, all works fine!\n\nFailing Texture Example with Compression Enabled (DXT)\n![back_21112](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7510826/5840687/b90f235e-a197-11e4-916d-0c76ff090d57.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3450","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3450/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3450/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3450/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3450","id":55033220,"number":3450,"title":"Fix for #3447","user":{"login":"cra0zy","id":6773302,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6773302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy","html_url":"https://github.com/cra0zy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":12,"created_at":"2015-01-21T15:28:30Z","updated_at":"2015-01-22T19:52:13Z","closed_at":"2015-01-22T18:00:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/3450","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3450","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3450.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3450.patch"},"body":"Fix for #3447\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3450/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3449","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3449/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3449/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3449/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3449","id":55026090,"number":3449,"title":"Request: remove effects from Effect.EffectCache when effect is disposed","user":{"login":"tgjones","id":102049,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/102049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones","html_url":"https://github.com/tgjones","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgjones/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2015-01-21T14:34:51Z","updated_at":"2015-02-13T14:01:24Z","closed_at":"2015-02-13T14:01:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Effects are cached in a private static field in `Effect.EffectCache`. But the only code that calls the internal `Effect.FlushCache()` is `Game.Dispose()`.\n\nIt took me a while to figure out that this is the root cause of why some of my visual tests are failing. I'm not using a `Game` object - I'm just creating lower-level objects like `GraphicsDevice` directly. But because I'm disposing the `GraphicsDevice` and other graphics resources after each test, any effects left in the cache are unusable. Any subsequent tests that use the same `Effect` don't work.\n\nI'm not sure what the best solution is - it seems like cached effects should be removed when the `GraphicsDevice` used to create them (rather than the `Game`) is disposed? Or at least, when the `Effect` itself is disposed (I think `GraphicsDevice.Dispose` already calls `Dispose` on `GraphicsResource` objects, so that may be enough).\n\nFor now, I've worked around it with this, but it's not pretty:\n\n``` csharp\ntypeof(Effect).GetMethod(\"FlushCache\", BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Static).Invoke(null, null);\n```\n\n**EDIT**: I've just run into a similar issue with state objects - I get exceptions because they are associated with a different graphics device. Basically, I think I need to be able to [what Game is doing here](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/Game.cs#L120) (or even better, have it happen implicitly when `GraphicsDevice` is disposed):\n\n``` csharp\nif (_graphicsDeviceManager != null)\n{\n    Effect.FlushCache();\n    BlendState.ResetStates();\n    DepthStencilState.ResetStates();\n    RasterizerState.ResetStates();\n    SamplerState.ResetStates();\n\n    ...\n}\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3449/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3448","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3448/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3448/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3448/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3448","id":55019038,"number":3448,"title":"Pipeline Indicator Fix","user":{"login":"cra0zy","id":6773302,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6773302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy","html_url":"https://github.com/cra0zy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cra0zy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-01-21T13:37:21Z","updated_at":"2015-01-21T20:31:20Z","closed_at":"2015-01-21T20:29:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/3448","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3448","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3448.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3448.patch"},"body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3447","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3447/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3447/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3447/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3447","id":55015633,"number":3447,"title":"Linux SpriteFont Processor doesn't use family names","user":{"login":"CallumDev","id":10167247,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10167247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallumDev","html_url":"https://github.com/CallumDev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallumDev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallumDev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallumDev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallumDev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallumDev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallumDev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallumDev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallumDev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallumDev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-01-21T13:05:01Z","updated_at":"2015-01-22T20:11:56Z","closed_at":"2015-01-22T20:11:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When building a spritefont file in Pipeline on Linux, mgcb searches for the font by filename, but not by family name.
