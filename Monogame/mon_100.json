This was originally developed to address https://github.com/hach-que/Protobuild/issues/33, although I didn't have time then to update MonoGame or cocas2d-xna to support the new functionality.\n\nPrimarily this functionality separates the idea of a platform (which encapsulates platform-specific code and platform-specific project structures) and the idea of different APIs (or backends) as services.\n\nFor example, on Windows, you have the option of using 3 different graphics implementations:\n- DirectX\n- OpenGL\n- Angle\n\nThese are currently exposed as Windows, WindowsGL and Angle respectively.  However, this setup does not work for consumers of MonoGame (who consume it as a Protobuild library).  The most direct example is that if someone wanted to include platform-specific code in their game, but use the Angle graphics API in MonoGame, they currently have no way of doing so when using MonoGame as a submodule.\n\nLonger term, this also allows MonoGame to have multiple graphics APIs on mobile platforms; currently if you were to create an `iOSMetal` platform, it wouldn't be treated as iOS in terms of the project format generated.  Service dependencies keep these two concerns separate, so that a (potential) Metal-based graphics API could be enabled with `--enable MetalGraphics` when generating the projects.\n\nTo this end, the graphics and audio APIs have been exposed as services, such as `OpenGLGraphics`.  `WindowsGL` and `Angle` platforms have appropriate settings such that they work as they do currently.  Now when consuming MonoGame as a Protobuild submodule, and wanting to use an alternate graphics API, users can add the following to their game project:\n\n```\n<Dependencies>\n  <Uses Name=\"MonoGame.Framework/OpenGLGraphics\">\n    <Platforms>Windows</Platforms>\n  </Uses>\n</Dependencies>\n```\n\nAnd the OpenGL API will be used by MonoGame when the user generates their projects for `Windows` (without using the `WindowsGL` platform).\n\n(I've also removed the `Protobuild.sh` and `Protobuild.command` files as per discussion in https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/pull/2966; the appropriate way to start Protobuild from the graphical UI on non-Windows platforms is to associate the `.exe` file type in your OS with Mono)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3011","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3011/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3011/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3011/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3011","id":43589576,"number":3011,"title":"[WP8] fix memory leak when Resume game","user":{"login":"nkast","id":3018589,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3018589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast","html_url":"https://github.com/nkast","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkast/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-09-23T04:17:45Z","updated_at":"2015-04-12T14:31:08Z","closed_at":"2015-03-15T00:51:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/3011","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3011","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3011.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3011.patch"},"body":"ContentManager & ContentReaders was creating new instances during\nAssetReload.
