something weird.\n- There is a thick white border around the display area... might be why I am not getting a 1080p back buffer.\n- For some reason XB1 doesn't like how our static VBs and IBs are created... it fails to copy data into them, however dynamic buffers work fine.\n\nThe first two i'm told are new features that MS added to make apps seamlessly work on TVs within the safe area.   There are APIs to disable these things which I think we would want to do at the platform level...  games deal with the safe area on their own.\n\nThe last one i'm still trying to figure out.  We don't have issues with static VBs or IBs on any other UWP platform...  Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile, or even Rasberry Pi 2/3.  So either we're doing something wrong that all the other platforms are tolerant of and let slip by...  or the XB1 Win10 OS has a bug in this area.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4696","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4696/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4696/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4696/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4696","id":145198114,"number":4696,"title":"Fixing and cleaning AL source management","user":{"login":"mrhelmut","id":3427451,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3427451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut","html_url":"https://github.com/mrhelmut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":14,"created_at":"2016-04-01T14:40:12Z","updated_at":"2016-04-21T10:43:13Z","closed_at":"2016-04-18T13:06:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/4696","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4696","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4696.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4696.patch"},"body":"Fixes #4672 \nFixes #4660\n\nThis PR fixes an issue where a `SoundEffectInstance` could share its AL source with another `SoundEffectInstance` or even `Song`.

Press Z or X to play a sound.\n\nThe game crashes because the SoundEffect.SoundBuffer (in SoundEffect.OpenAL.cs) is not set\nTheres only one assignment anywhere and it's in SoundEffect.PlatformInitialize but this is only ever called from one of the two SoundEffect constructors.

One thing I'd like to see is the ability for games (and in particular, engines written on top of MonoGame) to be able to initialize the Shader class and Effect class without requiring them to write out shaders in the MGFX format.\n\nIn particular, I want to be able to support geometry shaders before the file format is updated to support it (I really don't like touching the file format because when it gets changed everyone has to recompile their assets).\n\nMy proposal here is to replace the BinaryReader on Shader and Effect, with an interface like `IShaderReader` and `IEffectReader`.  `IShaderReader` would look like:\n\n``` csharp\nnamespace Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics\n{\n    public interface IShaderReader\n    {\n        ShaderStage GetStage();\n\n        byte[] GetBytecode();\n\n        int GetSamplerCount();\n\n        SamplerType GetSamplerType(int samplerIndex);\n\n        int GetSamplerTextureSlot(int samplerIndex);\n\n        int GetSamplerSamplerSlot(int samplerIndex);\n\n        SamplerState GetSamplerState(int samplerIndex);\n\n        string GetSamplerName(int samplerIndex);\n\n        int GetSamplerParameter(int samplerIndex);\n\n        int GetConstantBufferCount();\n\n        int GetConstantBufferValue(int constantBufferIndex);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nInternally MonoGame can use a BinaryReader-based version of this for MGFX files, while other engines can load shaders and effects through their own systems.  This also raises the possibility of having backwards compatibility in the MGFX format because you can swap out the implementation of the interface based on the version number in the MGFX file.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4677","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4677/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4677/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/4677/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/4677","id":143744397,"number":4677,"title":"Fix

At first I thought that I was putting to much pressure on the OpenAL command buffer, but even adding locks to have a max of 10 AL calls per second doesn't change anything, and the problem can happen in moments when absolutely no `SoundEffect` is playing for several seconds.\n\nAny
