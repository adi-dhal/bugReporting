These properties need to be added to the iOS and Android projects somehow.\n\nWe will also need a way to specify in the IDE where the content builder is installed and\nsome way of allowing the developer to set a list of directories which can be used to resolve content processors and importers, this information can be written out to the content builder. This might be at the IDE level or at the project level, but more likely at the IDE level to start with.\n\nWe also need a way to populate a dropdown list of Processors and Importers so they can be easily selected. There can be defaults which will be used for known types so a .png when flagged as a MonoGameContent item will automatically get a Importer of TextureImporter and a processor of TextureProcessor.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1211","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1211/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1211/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1211/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1211","id":10199985,"number":1211,"title":"Add Command File To MGCB Tool","user":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":13477514,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/ContentPipeline","name":"ContentPipeline","color":"ededed","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tomspilman","id":103522,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomspilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomspilman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/6","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestone/6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/milestones/6/labels","id":171829,"number":6,"title":"Content Pipleline Release","description":"This milestone will be used to track Content Pipeline related issues.
