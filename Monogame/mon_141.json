all,\n\nso i've been battling issues with rendertargets in iOS (https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/issues/1641), and i'm stuck and unable to push an update for my game. i finally tried refactoring my game to draw shapes without rendertargets. unfortunately, after the refactor, i have run into a new issue (or the source of the other). i am trying to use a BasicEffect with a texture to draw my shapes.\n\nit looks fine in XNA Windows, but it draws solid white shapes in iOS. it looks like the call to GraphicsDevice.DrawUserPrimitives() is drawing the correct shapes, but the texture is not being applied, it's just drawing white.\n\ninitally i set up the effect like so.\n\n``` C#\n_WallEffect.World = Matrix.Identity;\n_WallEffect.View = Matrix.CreateLookAt(new Vector3(0, 0, 1), Vector3.Zero, Vector3.Up) * _Camera.SimView;\n_WallEffect.Projection = _Camera.SimProjection;\n_WallEffect.TextureEnabled = true;\n_WallEffect.Texture = _WallTexture;\n_WallEffect.VertexColorEnabled = true;\n```\n\nthen later i do some drawing:\n\n``` C#\n_Effect.Techniques[0].Passes[0].Apply();\n\ngraphicsDevice.DrawUserPrimitives(PrimitiveType.TriangleList, verticesFill, 0, verticesFill.Length / 3);\n```\n\nany help is appreciated, i'm stuck\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1770/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1769","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1769/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1769/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1769/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/1769","id":15133927,"number":1769,"title":"[Linux]
