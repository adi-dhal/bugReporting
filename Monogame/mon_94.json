been working on package management functionality in Protobuild for the last month or so, and after some previous discussion, I've been developing it further to better suit MonoGame.\n\nProtobuild's package management is designed to support both cross-platform libraries and cross-platform project templates.  For libraries, the binary packages it supports are LZMA compressed, deduplicated and can be swapped in-place for source code (and vice-versa).  For project templates, it provides an easier mechanism to start a Protobuild-based project using cross-platform libraries.\n\nAs a demonstration, [download the latest version of Protobuild](https://github.com/hach-que/Protobuild/raw/master/Protobuild.exe) into an empty directory, open a command prompt, and run:\n\n```\nProtobuild.exe --start http://protobuild.org/MonoGame/Template.2DPlatformer@develop MyNewPlatformer\n```\n\nThis works on all desktop platforms (although Mac OS is untested).  For this demonstration you'll need Git in your path because there's no binary package present yet for the project template itself, and if you're running this on Mac OS or Linux, prefix the command with `mono`.  When the command completes, you should be able to open the solution in Visual Studio or Xamarin Studio and run the game.\n\nProtobuild's package management has several advantages over using NuGet:\n\n**Full support for cross-platform projects, in particular those that need to make native calls (such as P/Invoke)**\n\nProtobuild designates library packages by platform; the same platforms that are used for generation, and not framework API.\n\n**Automatic fallback to source code repositories if binary versions are not available for the platform**\n\nUsers can swap out binary packages for source versions and vice-versa transparently.  This makes it easier to diagnose issues and bugs.  To try that with the demonstration above, run:\n\n```\nProtobuild.exe --swap-to-source http://protobuild.org/MonoGame/MonoGame\nProtobuild.exe --generate\n```\n\nor try the reverse:\n\n```\nProtobuild.exe --swap-to-binary http://protobuild.org/MonoGame/MonoGame\nProtobuild.exe --generate\n```\n\n**Packages are LZMA compressed and deduplicated to significantly reduce their size**\n\nFor reference, the binary packages I've built are:\n- Windows + Content Pipeline: 24.4Mb\n- Linux + Content Pipeline: 15.7Mb\n- WindowsGL: 1.5Mb\n\nThe content pipeline includes all external tools and relevant binaries (e.g. ffmpeg + ffprobe for those platforms).\n\n**Support for module templates as packages**\n\nAs demonstrated above, this makes it very easy for people to start with MonoGame on any platform (not just Windows).  This requires no installation of MonoGame for developers to start using the engine.\n\n(This doesn't fix some of the issues with running the Content Pipeline on other platforms, but these exist independent on the method of using MonoGame)\n\n**Automatic package configuration**\n\nPartly the reason that #3179 was submitted; Protobuild can automatically package the MonoGame project for any platform after it's built, with no additional configuration required.  The following commands will produce a binary package suitable for uploading:\n\n```\nProtobuild.exe --generate Windows\nmsbuild\nProtobuild.exe --pack . package_Windows.tar.lzma Windows\n```\n\nTo upload it is:\n\n```\nProtobuild.exe --push <api_key> package_Windows.tar.lzma http://protobuild.org/MonoGame/MonoGame <git_hash> Windows <optional_branch_to_update>\n```\n## \n\nMore documentation on the package management feature can be found at [documentation](https://protobuild.readthedocs.org/en/latest/package_management_protobuild.html).  I have pretty much all of this work in a PR (which is not yet submitted, pending discussion on this issue), except for the package push commands which will require some build server configuration.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3193","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3193/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3193/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3193/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3193","id":49635380,"number":3193,"title":"Pipeline tool generates shifted sprite font from texture when starting char is 'space'","user":{"login":"mrhelmut","id":3427451,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3427451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut","html_url":"https://github.com/mrhelmut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrhelmut/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-11-21T00:01:15Z","updated_at":"2014-11-21T08:31:52Z","closed_at":"2014-11-21T08:31:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hello there,\n\nI've been experiencing an issue with the pipeline tool while trying to generate a sprite font from a texture.

It seems that it uses the character index 0 ('null') instead of the default index 32 ('space') as starting character.\n\nI tried generating the sprite font with the XNA Content Pipeline (and MonoGame sprite font processor) and the generated font is OK.\nThis makes me think that the problem comes from the Pipeline tool itself which trims the first character parameter (or basically anything?).\n\nSorry for not fixing this (probably) trivial issue myself, I'm not into Xwt and don't really where to look.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3192","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3192/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3192/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3192/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3192","id":49601997,"number":3192,"title":"Change OpenGL resources dispose behavior","user":{"login":"prollin","id":502478,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/502478?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin","html_url":"https://github.com/prollin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prollin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2014-11-20T18:44:06Z","updated_at":"2015-01-23T16:26:24Z","closed_at":"2014-12-31T00:33:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/3192","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3192","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3192.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3192.patch"},"body":"Simplified dispose behavior for opengl resources.

Here's a link to the original topic: http://community.monogame.net/t/soundeffects-distort-or-dont-play-after-a-while/1459\n\nI'm making a Defense game for the Windows Store in which you kill lots of enemies, and each time an enemy dies it plays a sound. It's not a problem at first, but once the player gets to around Level 38 in a single playthrough the sounds will distort or sometimes stop altogether. I'm playing sounds using SoundEffect.Play() and music with SoundEffectInstance. SoundEffect.Play() is always returning true, so there aren't too many instances being played at once.\n\nAn easy way to replicate this issue is to play the same sound 10 times in Update() for around 8-10 seconds. Then, any subsequent sounds will distort or simply not play.\n\nThere was a reported memory leak issue for SoundEffects here: http://community.monogame.net/t/soundeffect-loaded-via-contentmanager-causing-memory-leak-after-resume/1174\n\nUnfortunately it seems that the fix is not in place for the current build, and I suspect that either memory leak or failure to properly clean up SoundEffects after they finish playing is the cause of my problem. When the problem occurs and I check Task Manager, the game takes up roughly 30% of my CPU as opposed to 1-2% when the game starts.\n\nEDIT: Based on the comments below, it seems this is an actual issue with MonoGame as this problem doesn't seem to occur with XNA.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3180/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3179","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3179/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3179/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/3179/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3179","id":49189781,"number":3179,"title":"Migrate Lidgren.Network to Protobuild","user":{"login":"hach-que","id":504826,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/504826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que","html_url":"https://github.com/hach-que","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hach-que/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-11-18T07:21:20Z","updated_at":"2014-11-25T22:40:17Z","closed_at":"2014-11-25T22:40:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/pulls/3179","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3179","diff_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3179.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/3179.patch"},"body":"This change migrates Lidgren.Network to Protobuild, which is the last C# project remaining.\n\nTested on Linux and could build Linux, Windows and WindowsGL platforms.
