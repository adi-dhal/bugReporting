I realise this is cutting it fine for the 3.0 code freeze, so I'll leave it up to the other devs to decide if it's worth adding. \n- Implemented MasterVolume modulation. This just didn't work for Android before.\n- Getting the SoundState from SoundEffectInstance will now work for looping sounds a least. The underlying Andriod SoundPool API does not support this, so we rely on the stored state in SoundEffectInstance. One notable change here is that for non-looping sounds, we will always be reporting the state as Playing (even after it's finished) as opposed to always reporting Stopped (even when it's playing). I could change that back if people think it's better to keep previous behaviour for non-looping sounds.\n- Playing the same SoundEffect multiple times would result in both instances referencing the last played _streamId, meaning you could never stop the first one if it was looping. To fix this I refactored the _streamId out of the Andriod specific Sound.cs and into SoundEffectInstance.cs. This does make the code messier, but until we get OpenAL, I think it's worth it.\n- I also accidentally commited a couple of minor improvements to the ContentTypeReaderManager to this branch. I figured these are worth including though.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/778/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/777","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/777/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/777/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/777/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/pull/777","id":6925228,"number":777,"title":"Microsoft.Devices.Sensors

It works like this...\n\n```\nstatic void Main()\n{\n   var factory = new MonoGame.Framework.GameFrameworkViewSource<MyGameClass>();\n   Windows.ApplicationModel.Core.CoreApplication.Run(factory);\n}\n```\n\n... this works very similar to how initialization is done on XNA for Windows or Xbox.  The main trouble with this technique is it creates its own WinRT application framework which cannot host XAML content.\n### The Silverlight Method\n\nThis next method was created to get XAML support via mimicking how XNA+Silverlight apps work on WP7.  It is a more low level technique which has the user create a SharedGraphicsDeviceManager and GameTimer objects...\n\n```\n_manager = SharedGraphicsDeviceManager();\n_manager.PreferredBackBufferWidth = (int)((XamlSwapChainPanel.Width * (dpi / 96.0)) + 0.5);\n_manager.PreferredBackBufferHeight = (int)((XamlSwapChainPanel.Height * (dpi / 96.0)) + 0.5);\n_manager.SwapChainPanel = XamlSwapChainPanel;\n_manager.ApplyChanges();\n\n_timer = new GameTimer();\n_timer.UpdateInterval = TimeSpan.Zero;\n_timer.Update += (o, a) => Update(new GameTime(a.TotalTime, a.ElapsedTime));\n_timer.Draw += (o, a) => Draw(new GameTime(a.TotalTime, a.ElapsedTime));\n_timer.Start();\n```\n\nWhile this method is what some WP7 developers have used it suffers from one major flaw... you lose use of the Game and GameComponent classes.\n\nAt first this doesn't seem like a big loss... but soon you realize it is a huge one.  You will find all sorts of 3rd-party XNA libraries that depend on GameComponent or Game which you either need to modify or rewrite.  Worse the Game class provided major abstractions to platform specific events and state which becomes a huge burden when targeting multiple platforms.\n### XamlGame\n\nThis new method in this pull request offers the best of both techniques.  You get the Game classes as well as use of XAML.  The usage is very simple...\n\n```\n_game = XamlGame<MyGameClass>.Create(launchArguments, coreWindow, swapChainBackgroundPanel);\n```\n\n... this code typically goes into your App.xaml.cs or your main GamePanel classes.\n\nYou can freely call into your Game class from XAML code or have your Game class call XAML code itself.  You can use all the normal Game class features and events like Game.Window.ClientSizeChanged, Game.Content, Game.IsMouseVisible, etc.\n\nI stopped short of supporting more exoteric scenarios like multiple Game classes in one XAML app or changing the SwapChainBackgroundPanel during gameplay.  If we find users have a need for more flexibility we can add it in MonoGame 3.1.\n### The 3-Way\n\nWhile we should strive to keep down complexity i think for now i recommend keeping all 3 techniques.  Not only would be disruptive to people shipping games for Win8 launch to remove any of them, but really depending on your goals you might want one over another.  \n\nLater we should evaluate the usage of the different methods and either find ways to merge functionality or remove one or more of them.\n### To-dos\n\nThere are a few things we need to do related to these changes:\n- We need a document explaining the three methods and their trade offs (this pull message is a good start).\n- We need to implement VS2012 templates for all 3 methods.\n- Need to port some samples to use these techniques.\n\n... these are most likely tasks that will fall into other pull requests.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/772/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/771","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/771/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/771/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/771/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/771","id":6886427,"number":771,"title":"Attempting to reset the graphics device throws an exception","user":{"login":"vchelaru","id":729631,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/729631?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru","html_url":"https://github.com/vchelaru","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vchelaru/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":525783,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/iOS","name":"iOS","color":"3200fd","default":false},{"id":7430385,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MonoGame/MonoGame/labels/Windows%2010%20UWP","name":"Windows 10 UWP","color":"d7e102","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2012-09-14T20:31:47Z","updated_at":"2016-01-16T00:00:58Z","closed_at":"2016-01-16T00:00:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It's pretty obvious because it throws a NotImplementedException but I thought i'd bring it up because it causes problems on my current project.
