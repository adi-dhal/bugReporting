Create a \"Sprite\" asset\n2. Import a tiled sprite as the \"Texture\"\n3. Set the grid size of the sprite using the \"Setup\" button\n4. Create a new animation\n5. Set the first (left) number of the animation as 0 (= the first image of the first row)\n6. Increase the second (middle) number of the animation up to 6 (= the first image of the second row)\n\n**Expected behavior :**\nThe purple preview layer shown over the sprite should highlight the first row (6 images) and the first image of the second row, as they're the selected sprites for the created animation.\n\n**Encountered problem :**\nThe purple preview layer exeeds the first row on its right and highlights a 7th non-existent image. The animation preview at the bottom of the editor still works and understands that we want the images of the tiled sprite between indexes 0 and 6.\n\nHere is a visual representation of the issue, I've added the sprites index myself for more clarity.\n![01-29-2016 14-14-33](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1526969/12676469/cd3257fe-c692-11e5-97fd-b1338a36f13d.png)\n\nAnd here's the sprite configuration for reference.\n![01-29-2016 14-15-38](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1526969/12676471/d0a07164-c692-11e5-8cd0-5c5c26178c94.png)\n\nIt's my first issue report so I hope it's understandable enough. :smile:

sparklinlabs guys,\n\nAwesome job you did with superpowers!\n\nI'm trying to launch superpowers as a server on a Raspberry Pi, but I get the following error :\n`Cannot GET /index.view`\n\nYet the server logs looks normal to me: \n`node server start`\n`2016-01-28 10:41:19 - Using data from /home/wassim/.local/share/Superpowers.`\n`2016-01-28 10:41:19 - Server v0.19.0 starting...`\n`2016-01-28

feels like something is missing on http://docs.superpowers-html5.com/en/getting-started/setting-up-superpowers\n\nI downloaded the 64-bit linux version, unzipped, and then I double-clicked the

At this point the docs say: \" You'll be asked to choose a username. This is not yet linked to your Superpowers account but you probably want to use the same.\"\n\nSo I tried some random username, but it just stays on that screen. There are no usernames listed in ~/.local/share/Superpowers/config.json   (just two ports, a blank password (which is for other people to login to your server, I assume), and `maxRecentBuilds:10`)\n\nAha, while typing this issue, I tried \"guest\" and that worked!\n\nSo: the docs need to say something like:\n   Give \"guest\" as the username, when prompted.
