It is heavily inspired by and based on the amazing Twine software: http://twinery.org/\n\nIt can output a simple json file which can then be parsed as dialogue/logic in games - that is interactive.\n\nYarn is in html5, so it is possible to add it to superpowers and give it the superpower to be collaborative! \ntry online: http://infiniteammo.com/yarn/\n\nHaving a yarn parser API in superpowers will make it easy to create adventure/rpg style games that rely heavily on story.\nCurrently there is a parser written in C#:\nhttps://github.com/thesecretlab/YarnSpinner\nit works on unity, since the games that yarn was used it run on unity. This is needed in order to be able to actually use yarn created dialogue/logic in your game.\n\nSo having Yarn in Superpowers will actually improve yarn in two ways:\n- it will allow more than one user to simultaneously work on a Yarn file and together write their game's story.\n- It will allow the developer to use yarn and yarn created dialogue without leaving the game engine - yarn editor being embedded in the game editor would allow that.\n\nHaving Yarn in superpowers would improve superpowers too:\n- It will make it a more viable choice to make adventure style games in - as it will make it much easier to develop such type of games\n- It could also potentially be used as a state machine - yarn's c# parser for example can take yarn json commands and parse them to trigger executing a function, changing a variable and all sorts of different things. Yarn dialogue boxes can also have a set of conditions in order to be triggered.\n  Paired with the interface of yarn editor - one can easily see it as a state machine editor, just as much as an interactive dialogue editor. Yarn syntax is very easy to understand:\n  https://github.com/thesecretlab/YarnSpinner/blob/master/Documentation/Usage.md\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/119/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/118","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/118/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/118/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/118/events","html_url":"https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/118","id":138502734,"number":118,"title":"Add scrollbars on Tilesets / Tilemaps previews","user":{"login":"nicoco59","id":3075241,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3075241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoco59","html_url":"https://github.com/nicoco59","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoco59/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoco59/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoco59/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoco59/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoco59/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoco59/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoco59/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoco59/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicoco59/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-03-04T15:28:31Z","updated_at":"2016-03-08T14:51:13Z","closed_at":"2016-03-08T14:51:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\n\nIt would be interesting to add scrollbars on the \"preview part\" on the right, for Tilesets / Tilemaps because for now I have to zoom / unzoom on some areas to focus on the part I want to add / edit.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/117","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/117/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/117/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/117/events","html_url":"https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/117","id":136973094,"number":117,"title":"Headless server not connecting","user":{"login":"Vynlar","id":920212,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/920212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vynlar","html_url":"https://github.com/Vynlar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vynlar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vynlar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vynlar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vynlar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vynlar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vynlar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vynlar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vynlar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vynlar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-02-27T21:53:08Z","updated_at":"2017-03-02T01:41:05Z","closed_at":"2016-07-29T00:48:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### What I've Done\n\nI downloaded the 64-bit linux version of Superpowers, extracted it on my 14.04 Ubuntu server and followed the directions at the bottom of [this page](http://docs.superpowers-html5.com/en/getting-started/setting-up-superpowers).
