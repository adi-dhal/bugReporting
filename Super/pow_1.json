running into a really weird error, which I think may possibly be a bug in the core code.\n\nI'm detecting when an actor goes a certain distance off screen, and when they do, I want to reset their position to a point on screen. However, when doing this, the actor is only for a brief moment set to the specified position, and after that will continue to descend from the point they previously were; as if the position had never been reset.\n\nI have created a small example, based off the platformer demo, to illustrate the issue. The demo project can be downloaded from: http://static.rastating.com/superpowers/arcade-body-bug.zip\n\nAlternatively, if you'd rather paste the example code into a project yourself - create a new project using the platformer sample, create a gap in the tile map for the character to fall through, and then paste this code into the top of the `update` method of the character behavior:\n\n``` javascript\n    // Log to the console the current Y position of the actor - keep your eye on this when debugging.\n    Sup.log(this.actor.getY());\n\n    // If we fall below -200, then disable the arcadeBody so we can see from the log above that the Y position\n    // does indeed get reset to zero.\n    if (this.actor.getY() < -200) {\n      this.actor.arcadeBody2D.setEnabled(false);\n      this.actor.setPosition(-3.868, 0);\n    }\n\n    // After verifying the Y position has been reset to zero as per above, click the P key, and you'll see\n    // that once  the arcadeBody is re-enabled it will instantly pick up from the same Y position prior\n    // to it being reset to zero.\n    if (Sup.Input.isKeyDown(\"P\")) {\n      this.actor.arcadeBody2D.setEnabled(true);\n    }\n```\n\nAs per the comments in the code, once the character has fallen below -200, it will disable the arcadeBody and set the position back above the platform, at this point, we'll see in the console output that the Y position isn't budging from zero at all. However... should you then press the P key, you'll see it will start reporting that we're descending from the same Y position that we were previously.\n\nExample output from my console:\n\n```\n-188.6999969482422\n-191.4199981689453\n-194.16000366210938\n-196.9199981689453\n-199.6999969482422\n-202.5\n0\n205.32000732421875\n208.16000366210938\n211.02000427246094\n213.89999389648438\n216.8000030517578\n219.72000122070312\n0\n```\n\nAs you can see, it doesn't start descending from 0 once P is pressed, it just jumps straight back to 205.\n\nHopefully this will be enough information, if anymore is needed though please let me know :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/153","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/153/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/153/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/153/events","html_url":"https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-core/pull/153","id":185458424,"number":153,"title":"Supclient: fetch: workaround for ie11.","user":{"login":"Ikalou","id":3008001,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3008001?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ikalou","html_url":"https://github.com/Ikalou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ikalou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ikalou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ikalou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ikalou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ikalou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ikalou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ikalou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ikalou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ikalou/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-10-26T17:26:36Z","updated_at":"2016-10-29T12:09:56Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/pulls/153","html_url":"https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-core/pull/153","diff_url":"https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-core/pull/153.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-core/pull/153.patch"},"body":"Add a workaround for IE11 in SupClient/src/fetch.ts.\n\nIE11 doesn't automatically parse the XHR response as JSON even though \"responseType\" is set to \"JSON\" (it gives a string back instead).

As part of my current research, I'm studying the implications of open-sourcing a proprietary software, for instance, if the project succeed in attracting newcomers. However, I observed that some projects, like _superpowers-core_, deleted their software history when transitioning to open-source.\n\nhttps://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-core/commit/027ed12b46e6eb8bcc3cf1464ddbe9c8e914f540\n\nKnowing that software history is indispensable for developers (e.g., developers need to refer to history several times a day), I would like to ask superpowers-core developers the following four brief questions:\n1. Why did you decide to not keep the software history?\n2. Do the core developers faced any kind of problems, when trying to refer to the old history? If so, how did they solve these problems?\n3. Do the newcomers faced any kind of problems, when trying to refer to the old history? If so, how did they solve these problems?\n4. How does the lack of history impacted on software evolution? Does it placed any burden in understanding and evolving the software?\n\nThanks in advance for your collaboration,\n\nGustavo Pinto,

using version 0.22.0-dev and I've used both electron 1.1.1 and Google Chrome to try to edit projects. In both cases, (Even though Chrome was better) the script editor got extremely laggy. On Chrome, it seemed to get worse over time over time. In electron, it was slow from the start. Typing a single character would freeze the screen for a good few seconds while it attempts to detect errors. It's even worse when trying to do a multi-line comment, as it becomes almost impossible to close the comment because of the freeze checking the rest of the lines that were unintentionally commented. This makes superpowers almost completely unusable.\n\nI'm on a lower-end laptop, but it should be able to handle a code editor, right?\n\n[Here is a gif](http://imgur.com/6Iynj8G). It's kinda painful to watch :p.\nSince it's hard to tell, this is what is going on:\n1. I opened the script asset. Notice the long loading time. During this loading time, I attempted to change the cursor position and scroll down.\n2. When the scrolling finally worked, I scrolled to the bottom and added 2 new lines.\n3. After that, I typed some words at a normal typing speed. They didn't appear until much later.\n4. After they did appear, there was yet another delay as the editor attempted to find errors. During this time,  I attempted to change the cursor position a few times and select something.\n5. Finally, I commented what I wrote. It froze again and took a while to realize that there were no more errors.\n\nThis doesn't happen in the latest stable release (0.19.0). This is probably a critical issue
