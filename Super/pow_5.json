! First, congrats for the open-sourcing ! That's an awesome project :)\n\nI have a question regarding plugins and package management :\nCurrently the plugins used by a system are stored (and versioned) in the `plugins/` directory under different namespaces. Some plugins are used in different systems (`common`) and are fetched using git submodules.\n\nAs every plugin has a `package.json` in superpowers, why not just using npm to resolve plugins dependencies ? (and, potentially, to use systems as superpowers dependencies ?)\n\nThis may bring many benefits: maintainability, installing and updating plugins from cli/ui, nested dependencies...\n\nI made [some quick tests](https://github.com/risq/superpowers/commit/8f41df58d71542630f04c3b3c2a3c151e108628d) if you are interested. This is just a proof of concept (a quick hack on the system loader).\n\nIf you want to test it, just clone the repo (`git@github.com:risq/superpowers.git`), checkout on `externalized-plugins`, clone the official `superpowers-game` into `./systems`. \n\nThen manually delete `plugins/default/font` and build superpowers. Add the external font plugin (https://github.com/risq/superpowers-game-sparklinlabs-font-plugin) dependency with `npm i risq/superpowers-game-sparklinlabs-font-plugin --save`. Run the server, you should see the fonts plugin properly loaded.\n\nTell me what you think about this, and thanks for your great work !\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/15/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/14","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/14/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/14/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/14/events","html_url":"https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/14","id":125629823,"number":14,"title":"Use `const` whenever possible","user":{"login":"elisee","id":446986,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/446986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elisee","html_url":"https://github.com/elisee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elisee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elisee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elisee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elisee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elisee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elisee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elisee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elisee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elisee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":308688196,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/labels/good%20first%20bug","name":"good first bug","color":"5319e7","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-01-08T15:14:18Z","updated_at":"2016-01-15T19:16:10Z","closed_at":"2016-01-15T19:16:10Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"We've been using `let` for declaring variables almost everywhere. This is a good thing, as it is better-behaved than `var` (yay for block-scoping!).\n\nBut ES6 / TypeScript actually comes with [`const` keyword](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const). As a general rule, we should use it whenever possible, that is, whenever the variable identifier isn't meant to be reassigned.\n\n**Rationale:** It will make variable identifiers that are meant to be reassigned easier to locate, and will reduce the likelihood of accidental reassignements.\n\n> The const declaration creates a read-only reference to a value. It does not mean the value it holds is immutable, just that the variable identifier cannot be reassigned.\n\nDoing this in the whole codebase all at once might be a pain, so feel free to submit a pull request that just takes care of a file or two. Over time, we'll get there.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/14/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/13","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/13/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/13/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/13/events","html_url":"https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/13","id":125620133,"number":13,"title":"new ImageData error chromium","user":{"login":"DavidMeagher1","id":9757623,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/9757623?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidMeagher1","html_url":"https://github.com/DavidMeagher1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidMeagher1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidMeagher1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidMeagher1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidMeagher1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidMeagher1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidMeagher1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidMeagher1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidMeagher1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidMeagher1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-01-08T14:14:30Z","updated_at":"2016-01-08T19:53:41Z","closed_at":"2016-01-08T19:53:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"runtime.js:1394 Uncaught TypeError: Failed to construct 'ImageData': Illegal constructor\n\nvar imageData = new ImageData(new Uint8ClampedArray(map), data.textureWidth, data.textureHeight);\n\nI am using node-webkit to run a simple test game, after publishing it it won't run. seems to work fine in the editor though i haven't taken a look. but i thought i would put this here for now\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/13/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/12","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/12/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/12/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/12/events","html_url":"https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-core/issues/12","id":125489673,"number":12,"title":"launcher: Translation for \"Cancel\" is missing","user":{"login":"Peekmo","id":3881523,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3881523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peekmo","html_url":"https://github.com/Peekmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peekmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peekmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peekmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peekmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peekmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peekmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peekmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peekmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peekmo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-01-07T21:36:27Z","updated_at":"2016-02-05T14:30:41Z","closed_at":"2016-02-05T14:30:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello,\n\nI just downloaded your first release for linux 64, and there's a problem for the translation of the \"cancel\" button when I click on \"Add Server\" (see screenshot)\n\n![Screenshot of error](http://i.imgur.com/hGKE2B4.png)\n\nI looked into \"locales\" in your repo, there's the translation.
