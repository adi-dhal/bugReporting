on a project of mine, I noticed that not all bullet shapes implemented the TypeWritable API for serialization on bam file. So I implemented serialization for those who lacked. In particular:\n- made serializable the following shapes: BulletHeightfieldShape, BulletCapsuleShape, BulletConeShape, BulletCylinderShape, BulletConvexPointCloudShape, BulletMinkowskiSumShape, BulletMultiSphereShape\n- corrected the serialized parameters for BulletBoxShape (the old version led to a growth of the box size during restoring)\n- also added the linear and angular velocity as serialized data for BulletRigidBodyNode, so that also the dynamic state of the rigid body could be restored.\n\nAs far as possible I tried to follow the original author's programming style (enn0x), but I had to add some variables only used for serialization, as bullet, sometimes, changes the original creation parameters, and therefore hardly obtainable by bullet underlying structures.\nI attached a test script: the scene is saved on exit on 'scene.bam' file, and put this file as argument to restore
