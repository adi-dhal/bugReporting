E.g. pressing \"Ctrl+\\\" emits neither a 'keydown' nor a 'textinput' event for libRocket.  \n\nlibRocket calls several punctuation keys \"OEM\" in its KeyIdentifier enum, so I assume those were overlooked.  This patch fills those in from Panda's side, assuming a US English keyboard, like libRocket's comments say.  Better that than losing the events entirely...?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/panda3d/panda3d/issues/31/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/panda3d/panda3d/issues/30","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/panda3d/panda3d","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/panda3d/panda3d/issues/30/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/panda3d/panda3d/issues/30/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/panda3d/panda3d/issues/30/events","html_url":"https://github.com/panda3d/panda3d/pull/30","id":77850187,"number":30,"title":"change drive of largeblobsenderconsts","user":{"login":"muschter","id":10735958,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10735958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muschter","html_url":"https://github.com/muschter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muschter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muschter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muschter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muschter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muschter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muschter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muschter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muschter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muschter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-05-18T23:29:12Z","updated_at":"2015-10-28T22:52:39Z","closed_at":"2015-10-28T22:52:39Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/panda3d/panda3d/pulls/30","html_url":"https://github.com/panda3d/panda3d/pull/30","diff_url":"https://github.com/panda3d/panda3d/pull/30.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/panda3d/panda3d/pull/30.patch"},"body":"probably wont get merged but it's worth a shot\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/panda3d/panda3d/issues/30/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/panda3d/panda3d/issues/29","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/panda3d/panda3d","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/panda3d/panda3d/issues/29/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/panda3d/panda3d/issues/29/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/panda3d/panda3d/issues/29/events","html_url":"https://github.com/panda3d/panda3d/pull/29","id":76819888,"number":29,"title":"Fix invalid assumptions in GravityWalker","user":{"login":"jjkoletar","id":735098,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/735098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjkoletar","html_url":"https://github.com/jjkoletar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjkoletar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjkoletar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjkoletar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjkoletar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjkoletar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjkoletar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjkoletar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjkoletar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjkoletar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-05-15T18:51:57Z","updated_at":"2015-07-17T18:39:59Z","closed_at":"2015-07-17T18:39:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/panda3d/panda3d/pulls/29","html_url":"https://github.com/panda3d/panda3d/pull/29","diff_url":"https://github.com/panda3d/panda3d/pull/29.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/panda3d/panda3d/pull/29.patch"},"body":"The setCollisionRayHeight method assumed that the 0th child on the\navatar would be the av's GeomNode, and again assumed that the 2nd child of\nthe GeomNode would be this Walker's cRayNode.
