have some issues when activating shadows after the last updates from the built 1144. They do not work as before. Previously they looked realistic and propperly calculated, while now, it seems like shadows are applied to objects just inside a radius, and actually, quite wrong. I have not changed the code, and installing back the built 1144 everything works fine again.

It allows to choose the compression level for writing out PNG images. Valid values are 0 (no compression), or 1 (best speed) to 9 (best compression). The default value is 6 and has been 6 when used in conjunction with libpng+zlib. PNG compression is lossless.\r\n\r\nThe resulting file size for PNG files could be optimized further by choosing \"filters\" intelligently as described on http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/book/chapter09.html and in http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/book/LCH-png-chapter.pdf . However, this is out of scope here and several programs like PNGCRUSH and OptiPNG exist that aim to accomplish this task.\r\n\r\nFor the future, a nice-to-have would be to be able to disable chroma

common concept of exponent calculation for quaternions appears to be missing from panda3d.core.LQuaternionf/panda3d.core.LRotationf.\r\n\r\nWhen interpreting a quaternion as a relative rotation (and not an orientation), you could e.g. want to apply only half or only 30% of a rotation. The computation of this appears to be commonly notated with q as base and e.g. 0.5 or 0.3 as exponent: `q ** 0.3` (as described here: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/162863/how-to-get-a-part-of-a-quaternion-e-g-get-half-of-the-rotation-of-a-quaternion/162892#162892 )\r\n\r\nHowever, on the panda3d API reference page http://www.panda3d.org/reference/devel/python/panda3d.core.LQuaternionf the only function even mentioning exponent returns LVecBase4f and not a Quaternion and seems to be inherited from LVecBase4f instead of doing something quaternion-specific.\r\n\r\nIs such a functionality implemented somewhere and I'm just missing it? Otherwise, it would be very useful if this could be added.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/panda3d/panda3d/issues/160/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/panda3d/panda3d/issues/159","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/panda3d/panda3d","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/panda3d/panda3d/issues/159/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/panda3d/panda3d/issues/159/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/panda3d/panda3d/issues/159/events","html_url":"https://github.com/panda3d/panda3d/issues/159","id":248396356,"number":159,"title":"man pages installed from .deb package have the wrong permissions","user":{"login":"kjcole","id":459840,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/459840?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjcole","html_url":"https://github.com/kjcole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjcole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjcole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjcole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjcole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjcole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjcole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjcole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjcole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjcole/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/panda3d/panda3d/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/panda3d/panda3d/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/panda3d/panda3d/milestones/1/labels","id":2742833,"number":1,"title":"1.9.5","description":"","creator":{"login":"rdb","id":194842,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/194842?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdb","html_url":"https://github.com/rdb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":1,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2017-09-04T11:08:38Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T13:13:04Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-08-07T12:30:53Z","updated_at":"2017-09-04T11:09:54Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"The package `panda3d1.9` installed from\r\n\r\n```\r\ndeb http://archive.panda3d.org/ubuntu xenial main\r\n```\r\n\r\nsets the permission of the man pages to 600.
