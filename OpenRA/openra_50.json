figured this trait must have simply not been thought of to add to OpenRA yet since you guys are likely focusing on bigger things so here it is.\r\n\r\nGarrisonCapture Trait: this allows a player to garrison a structure or unit and change the side/faction of said unit/structure to that of the side/faction of the units inside it.  I've seen this happen in the version of Red Alert and TS that came after the first versions where if you sent units into a building to garrison it the building would change to the side of those units with a few exceptions.  Like in the case of mind-controlled units where their faction/side on entry is used instead of their faction/side after once control over them has been returned to the original owner.\r\n\r\nI figured this trait could be very handy to players that like to mess with the code and it'd also help with someone is building a city map and wants players to be able to send their units to take it over to slow down their enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso a side note idea for those of you that know how to mess with the AI's main C# code why not tell the AI to locate any structures/units that have empty garrison/cargo slots for units and tell it to randomly select correct units to fill those slots.  In the case of transports there could also be a trait to tell the AI to auto deploy them when close enough to an enemy force.  In both these AI ideas it does add a couple more traits for the players to mess with to let them change things up a bit.\r\n\r\nAs for the main idea of a GarrisonCapture Trait this will help open up some doors you may have been scratching your heads as to how to open.

implements the next step towards #11813 and #12554 by adding plumbing to support externally developed mods:\r\n\r\n* The `Engine.DefaultMod` launch argument allows mods to override the hardcoded switch to the modchooser when a mod isn't available.\r\n* The `ModContent` section in mod.yaml is no longer required, and can now customize the behaviour when assets aren't available.\r\n* The `Engine.ModSearchPaths` launch argument allows mods to override where the engine looks for mods.\r\n\r\nThese are used by the new [pchote/OpenRAModTemplate](https://github.com/pchote/OpenRAModTemplate) repository (which i'll move to the OpenRA org once this has been merged) which sets up a development/runtime/(eventually) packaging environment for third party mods.\r\n\r\nDepends on #12600.

The attack traits can then check for this case and trigger a repath.\r\n\r\nFinding a cell to move too should be relatively easy:  follow the approach of `FindResources.ClosestHarvestablePos`, replacing the \"can harvest cell\" check with a \"can fire from\" check:\r\n* Use `BlocksProjectiles.AnyBlockingActorsBetween` for walls or other blocking actors.\r\n* Terrain (on heightmap enabled mods) is slightly trickier, but could be split into phases (are there any height changes? &rarr; does the line intercept with a bounding box defiend by `map.Height[cell]`? &rarr; check points on path
