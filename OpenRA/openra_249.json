have post that idea before but i came with an easyer way for the devs to add it\nwhat if we have an external \"server program\" (and a client program) that will act as a loby(with a global map with regions and attack options),then when the players start an (visual) invasion in the loby it will automaticly start a dedicated server placing the players in some predifinend positions (an spawn actor named lets say \"globspwan\" for example)\nif one side wins then the server will sent the data to the \"server program\" and change the color of the area\\region\\country to the wining side to blue or red allied\\soviets and change the owner side name of the region\nafter that the \"server program\" will sent the data to the client program with the changes(so the players plan ther next attack)\n\nextra info on the idea\nthe idea is that the \"server program\" will sent a command to the client program and force it to start the openra and force join the dedicated server and force the player to set team,side,and ready status.\n\nthe dedicated server must be some how hiden from the normal server list.\n\nwell what you think about it?\n\n<bountysource-plugin>\n\n---\n\nWant to back

`WithProducedOverlay` (or maybe expand `WithProductionOverlay` to define different sequences for producing vs produced), and then set a Z-offset of around 256, which should be enough to cover exiting units but not those in front.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6651/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6650","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6650/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6650/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6650/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/6650","id":44857209,"number":6650,"title":"Allow

general consensus from the online players of the CNC mod is that the Commandos have too much HP. The case is often a few Commandos are dropped in the base, gain instant experience level up by using a C4 on valuable structures and then becomes an unstoppable wave of destruction. Most of the time not even a direct hit from airstrike will kill one at base stats and now with flame tanks being nerfed they're more of a juggernaut than ever. More people are getting frustrated by the \"[expletive deleted] Commandos\" every day and even those who frequently use this unit agree that they're somewhat OP.\n\nSo easy change: 150HP is adequate. With the reduction, commandos can still take on a guard tower, they still get their instant-level up on destroying structures and surprise invasive attacks are an effective part of GDI's strategy; but this change should stop a 1000$ unit crawling through armies of tanks and soldiers to plant three more C4s than should be reasonable. For as things stand now, Commandos are more deadly than A-Bombs, and you can build as many as your income allows.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4751","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"89D8:572B:D784B8:1C7A982:59D6B5F1","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=250>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=405>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=248>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"c22c3b5bd7d87ea735b21e3851e498ab\"","status":"200 OK"}}
