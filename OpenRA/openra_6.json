sprites are not pixel exact. Look at the head of the infantry or the trousers of the engineer (compare with other pic). They are broader/wider in x-axis. Some vertical (pixel)lines are duplicated (sprites only - not background). These are scaling bugs that differ from the original game. I'm not talking about general resizing or relative size of the sprites. Its about bad rendering/representation/graphic engine issues.\r\n\r\nIs there any fix for this?\r\n\r\nIgnore the red circle.
