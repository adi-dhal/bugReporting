the new UI for Red-Alert was released , it took some time (as regular player) until ive made my peace with it ... but ... \nthere is one element , that still bothers me alot , and that is the game-timer .. sadly squished into the new 250x500 user-interface as 30x10 pixel graphic output ... which is almost a \"6x-sized-down\" version from our old timer ... here for comparison ( old one is left , and new one right ) :\n\n![timer](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9139965/5780224/205c39ea-9da9-11e4-89d4-865e03cde5e9.png)\n\nits not as easy to catch the timer in the new UI anymore ... but it should be easy ,  the game-timer is a important element in \"RTS-Multiplayer\"-games because ... time-management is essential for these type of games ... and should be easily and quick  \"accessible\" for a players eye \ni show you guys 2 more screenshots , the first one with the old UI ... and the 2nd with the new UI ... please check out the timer in both screenshots ... and think about , which one would suit better for a regular rts - player ...  \n\n![timer1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9139965/5780386/8e785dea-9daa-11e4-8653-8f0e40199c43.png)\n\n![timer2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9139965/5780391/976b8576-9daa-11e4-9f97-1358d6141be4.png)\n\nbzw.: ... in the replay-user-interface ... there is a ticker that constantly switches with the time ... showing a text that says what speed you are playing the replay ... and also when you pause the game ... unfortunately ... this ticker get faster with your chosen replay-speed ... which (on max) switches \"timer\" and \"text\" in every second ...  this is another concern \n\n**so , my suggestion / idea is ... to have (only) the timer back to its old behavior ... separated and centered with a proper size**
