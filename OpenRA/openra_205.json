warhead code is still a twisty mess, with a `DamageWarhead` class that contains a bunch of mod-specific concepts (like infantry prone and death types) hardcoded in the game assembly.\n\nWe can untangle these by defining a `Types` field that defines a list of tags (like we do for target types) that the `INotifyDamaged` consumers can query.\n\nFor example, a warhead that current defines `DeathType: 5` (fire) would define `Types: fire`, and `WithDeathAnimation` can define a dictionary of type &rarr; sequence (with a default defined on ^Infantry, so there's no gruntwork involved).  Prone modifiers can be similarly reversed: instead of the warhead saying \"I do 50% damage against prone actors\" the `TakesCover` trait can say \"I take 50% damage against types x,y,z while prone\".\n\nOnce this is done we should be able to implement a simple `IWarhead` interface to replace the `DamageWarhead` references in the engine code and finish the warhead decoupling that started with #6030.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7997/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7996","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7996/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7996/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7996/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7996","id":69587100,"number":7996,"title":"Fix
