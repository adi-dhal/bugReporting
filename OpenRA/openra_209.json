found that on one computer OpenRA was nearly unusable. Things i noticed:\n- the menu mouse pointer Y position is off. Mouseover and clicks correspond though.\n- the menu dropdown-fields scroll buttons are unresponsive (not even mouseover). Hence i cant select an AI to skirmish with.\n- there where horizontal line glitches. As if every ~30 pixels one line was missing. Especially noticeablewhen the menu shell map is scrolling, but also in the OpenRA logo.\n- when in Pseudo-Fullscreen / Fullscreen i saw a black bar at the top of the screen.\n\nI tried every combination of Pseudo-Fullscreen / Fullscreen / Windowed with Hardware Cursor and found no solution. With the latter the mouse Y offset varies though. \n\nSee attached screenshot: demonstrating most of the above:\n![openra screenshot 3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1420588/6997244/fc42386c-dbb4-11e4-9d68-876e2a111a45.png)\n_(the mouse actually was above Mods button, despite mouseover)_\n\nI was unable to screencapture fullscreen (i reported that to #5317), but i can say the mouse can enter black bar. I also suspect the black bar height corresponds with the number of horizontal line glitches, and it appears the mouse Y position is less off when near the bottom of the screen. It all seems interrelated.\n\nTested on release-20141029 and playtest-20150329. I cant remember seeing the problem before that.\nComputer specs: Windows Vista SP2 64bits, native resolution 1360x768, Geforce G210.\n\nPS. I am a programmer and willing to troubleshoot this myself, in case i might be the only one that can replicate this so far. Any insights welcome!\nI would like to play OpenRA while spending weekends with my in laws. :)\n\n_UPDATE: better screenshot and added indication_\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue?

yet another attempt to address people's issues with the \"Enemy units approaching\" notifications that both RA and D2k provide us with, deniz1a created some new notifications, which should be better suited for the task:\n\"Enemy units detected\" in D2k and\n\"Enemy detected\" in RA.\nNow, we may or may not want to go with \"Enemy units detected\" in RA as well, I'll leave that up for discussion.\nI converted the to .wav and uploaded here for easier testing:\n[Atreides](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ao4us7b20o6myf0/AI_ENEMY_DETECTED.wav)\n[Harkonnen](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yyb21agsfyoa8s5/HI_ENEMY_DETECTED.wav)\n[Ordos](https://www.dropbox.com/s/a5i8a3ddzmz7u0g/OI_ENEMY_DETECTED.wav)\n[RA](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r2357sht2902otc/enmydet.wav)\n\nAlso if anyone wants an easy way to hear the original files but doesn't have an appropriate tool, [this one](http://d2kplus.com/audioconverter.php) works pretty well.\n\nI will probably add a commit that actually makes use of these tomorrow.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7849/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4791","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"8689:572A:6FA4E9:FB61A9:59D6B556","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=210>;
