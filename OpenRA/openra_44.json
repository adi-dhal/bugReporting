Eventually they will compete for the same tiberium, resulting in harvesters being stuck and never continuing their harvesting, which will cause you to never increase your cash amount, if you are not paying attention to your harvesters.\r\n\r\nMaybe a potential fix would be to add some smarts to the harvester to recognize that something is in the way of its path, sort of like the minigunners that can avoid the tiberium, so that the harvester will move to a different tiberium tile instead of being

They are both just a location to provide to the unit to fire at. \r\n\r\nHaving the camo pillbox show up in the shroud is fine, because once you learn of the location of one, you make a mental note to pay close attention to it with artillery or v2's, even if it disappears or something later. But restricting the ability to force fire on it is absolute garbage.

Also other issues that are shared with general gameplay, like bogus dogs that make Soviet03 a gamble, or engies that change the balance on some missions where you have to capture stuff.\r\n\r\nThe issues I would like to adress/resolve now are:\r\n- [ ] Original tech tree vs. tech tree equivalent to skirmishes, unifying the experience and making things less confusing to new players. This would also need some rebalancing and altering the gameplay. Would flak trucks be allowed for Soviets? What about rocket soldiers for soviet side?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Undeploying the MCV is making things extremely easy for player, since the maps are usually made in such way that player has actively fight AI to gain control of new ore fields, while ATM he can basepush with small army group and cut off enemy, like in Soviet 05, where the central orefield is the only one for both AI and player.\r\n\r\n- [ ] I heard something about colors being slighty different, and about changing them a bit. We should agree on one color scheme and follow it from now on.\r\n\r\nNow for some specific issues:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Pending feedback from players, I think the sub activity in Allied06 is a bit..extreme, bordering ridiculous. You can just build wall of turrets or rocketsoldiers to deal with enemy. Maybe have AI patrol in several areas, and put a limit on subs, around 20ish at once on whole map?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Allied05, allowing Tanya to bomb half of enemy base including the only available ConYard is also a bit comical, but it was possible in original, too. Maybe release a pack of dogs/a tank on Tanya to make her retreat when she goes rampage on other things than SAMs?\r\n\r\nPlease, feel free to post about any other issue, balance or polish-wise you have with the campaign.\r\n\r\nPinging the main campaign contributors: @abcdefg30, @abc013, @Biofreak1987.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Please note that also [forum ](http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=82&p=300330#300330)entry was opened.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12806/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12805","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12805/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12805/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12805/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12805","id":208720495,"number":12805,"title":"Gather all official maps onto one account on the resource center.","user":{"login":"SoScared","id":2715583,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2715583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared","html_url":"https://github.com/SoScared","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-02-19T14:23:36Z","updated_at":"2017-02-19T14:26:54Z","closed_at":"2017-02-19T14:26:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Some of the official RA maps have been deleted, I'm sure I did at some point, now displayed on http://www.openra.net/games/ as 'Unknown Map'.\r\n\r\nThis can be fixed by re-uploading the maps right now but for the future, all the official maps could be collected through just 1 account, or better, if possible an \"official\" account to witch maps per protocol are uploaded to shortly after merging PRs.
