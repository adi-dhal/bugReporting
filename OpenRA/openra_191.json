I started with conversion of the Soviet 5th mission from the original campaign, however after recreating map and actors, I seem to be unable to do the scripting. I knew how to do it in RAED, but Lua is just too confusing for me, sorry. To complete it, I either need someone willing to do it or someone willing to answer my (probably dumb) questions. I did look at the wiki and all the tutorials, but for example I couldn't force the three guys at the start to even move. I tried to do ActorName.ScriptedMove (x,y), ActorName.ScriptedMove (waypointname.Location), and so on, but it never worked, log said he can't convert 0 to CPos. I tried to define CPos by using waypoint or raw coordinates, but in vain.\n\nI can send you the files if you tell me where,I cut the crashing lua from it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8413","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8413/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8413/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8413/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8413","id":85808408,"number":8413,"title":"launch-dedicated.sh:

bug happens when a second (or third, fourth etc.) Conyard deploys while a building is placed from the first Conyard.\n\nThe `WithMakeAnimation` running on the second CY uses `Animation::PlayThen` to call `Building::Unlock` in a delegate.\n\n`WithBuildingPlacedAnimation::BuildingPlaced` runs when a building placed and replaces the delegate from `WithMakeAnimation` with its own before it has a chance to run, and so the new Conyard never gets unlocked.\n\nThe fix is then to simply not run `BuildingPlaced` on conyards that haven't completed the make animation yet.\n\nFixes #8041.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8401","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8401/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8401/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8401/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8401","id":85746959,"number":8401,"title":"Fixed
