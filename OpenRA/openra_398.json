This is the case in all modern C&C games.\n\nWhen a player is disconnected for some reason, all of their assets should also go to an ally. There should be an equation present however, to prevent a few issues with this.\n\nIf a player quits, and has allies, it should first look for an ally that is of the same side of him. If yes, it will transfer assets to one of those players, preferably the one that is the worse off. If not, it will transfer assets to a player that is worst off.\n\nWhen subfactions are implemented, there should be a way to say that that side is the same as another side. Say we have countries in the game. Then the allied countries will treat each other as \"allied\" instead of \"england\" or \"france.\" But of course, it will find the exact subfaction first, then the other subfactions of that faction.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2180","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2180/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2180/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2180/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2180","id":4769826,"number":2180,"title":"d2kmod brainfart: hover units","user":{"login":"bellator","id":1689563,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1689563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bellator","html_url":"https://github.com/bellator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bellator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bellator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bellator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bellator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bellator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bellator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bellator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bellator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bellator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":14,"created_at":"2012-05-27T07:01:38Z","updated_at":"2012-06-25T00:00:05Z","closed_at":"2012-06-25T00:00:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I write this here because this idea will probably take some coding. \n\nI was thinking about remaking House Ordos somewhat along the lines of Emperor: BFD. And to do this, they need a new unit type: hovering vehicles. \n\nThey would have these features:\n- They would hover off the ground. Functionally, they would look like low flying helicopters. Like aircraft, they'd cast an automatic shadow and they'd rock up and down slightly like helos do in OpenRa to create the appearance of flight.\n- d2k has rough ground features that either stop or slow down vehicles. A sand tileset exists that slows down tanks. In the rock terrain, a tileset with large rocks stop vehicles entirely, but is accessible to infantry. Ordos hover tanks would be able to move across both of these terrain types without slowing down at all. (cliffs and such would of course stop them, since they're not actually flying but that's obvious:)\n- the hover vehicles would not be able to squash infantry, but they wouldn't be stopped by them either. Instead, when infantry is flown over by hover vehicles, they are forced to go prone, but remain unharmed. The hover vehicles fly over enemy and friendly infantry alike.\n- although not relevant to d2k, they would also be able to move over water.\n- of course, this unit type could be used in other mods as well if people like it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2180/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2179","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2179/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2179/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2179/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2179","id":4768902,"number":2179,"title":"Crash:
