old \"move within range\" logic used by the attack code cached the target position at the time the order was issued, which caused units to move to the wrong cell if the target moves, but also meant that the units would continue moving to the target's position if the target is killed.\n\nThe rewrite in #5617 fixed units pathing to the wrong cell, but introduced a regression (#5968) where units would stop moving if the target is destroyed.\n\nThis fixes that regression by switching the target to a static cell if the original target becomes

fix to address the core issue (slow replay browser loading) behind the suggestion given in #5942.\n\nThis parallelizes the loading process and removes a few bottlenecks. An informal test with 1200 replays sees the \"Load Replays\" time reduced from 3527 ms to 1210 ms on my dual core machine. Machines with more cores might see even bigger improvements but eventually IO will take over as the bottleneck so things will plateau somewhere.\n\nThis doesn't actually implement any lazy or background loading as suggested in #5942. That would probably be worthwhile, particularly for when the replay files are not in the file cache and waiting on IO becomes the main issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5971/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5970","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5970/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5970/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5970/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5970","id":38017220,"number":5970,"title":"There's no way to select the CD location","user":{"login":"WhyNotHugo","id":730811,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/730811?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo","html_url":"https://github.com/WhyNotHugo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382407,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"02d7e1","default":false},{"id":189987383,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/OS:%20Linux","name":"OS: Linux","color":"5e9fe7","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2014-07-16T19:40:01Z","updated_at":"2016-06-26T18:44:13Z","closed_at":"2016-06-26T18:44:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The UI has an option to install music from the CD, however there's no way to select the location of an ISO file, or where the CD is mounted, making it impossible to select the source for the data.\nI also haven't had access to any devices with optical (cd) readers for years, and expecting users to have one is a bit unrealistic nowadays.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue?

interesting problems in front of me\n(13:35:13) pchote: the problem is that the new MoveWithinRange implementation returns as soon as the pathing fails\n(13:35:18) pchote: while the old implementation would wait and repath\n(13:35:39) pchote: the new implementation has a wrapper in the Follow activity that does this, but that really wants to move up a level into the implementation itself\n(13:36:04) pchote: or to change the things that use that interface to repath themselves\n(13:36:33) pchote: I expect that the worst offender for this bad behaviour will be attackmove\n```\n##
