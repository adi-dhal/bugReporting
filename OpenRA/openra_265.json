very top-most of the globally displayed countdown timers (GPS / Nuke) is hidden under the options and statistics buttons.\n\nIn this image: http://s10.postimg.org/rqn8wo915/Error01.png you can see Yellow has a nuke, but its countdown is displayed under the buttons.

That way it would be easy to create these minimodes for any map and have some extra fun with different settings.\n\nThe file could simply consist of lines such as:\n\n```\nMy funny minimod\nrifleman\nrocketman\nlighttank\nharvester\nbarracks\nrefinery\npowerplant\n```\n\nWhich is very easy to read and write by anyone, including machines and humans.\n\nFirst line = minimod name (visible in the game room for everyone). You could therefore save these minimod files into some folder and use them later on any map, and other players could be able to browse the list in game room to see which units are enabled so they can prepare for the game.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6190/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6189","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6189/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6189/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6189/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/6189","id":39598468,"number":6189,"title":"6066 Crate Prerequisites","user":{"login":"UberWaffe","id":2726355,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2726355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/UberWaffe","html_url":"https://github.com/UberWaffe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UberWaffe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UberWaffe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UberWaffe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UberWaffe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UberWaffe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UberWaffe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UberWaffe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UberWaffe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UberWaffe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-08-06T08:08:23Z","updated_at":"2014-08-09T17:39:00Z","closed_at":"2014-08-09T05:14:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/6189","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/6189","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/6189.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/6189.patch"},"body":"Closes  #6066, #2587.\n\nAlso updated crate yaml for affected mods (RA and D2K).\n\nAlso adds YamlException on a GiveUnitCrateAction if it does not define any units to give.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6188","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6188/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6188/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6188/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/6188","id":39588079,"number":6188,"title":"Log reason why a Lua script fails to parse","user":{"login":"cjshmyr","id":566742,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/566742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr","html_url":"https://github.com/cjshmyr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-08-06T04:06:05Z","updated_at":"2014-08-06T13:51:31Z","closed_at":"2014-08-06T07:39:27Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/6188","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/6188","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/6188.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/6188.patch"},"body":"Explains more why the script failed parsing.
