This functions also sets the Maximum value for the Progressbar. It is not required to use this function the default of maximum is 100. Thats important for things like Webclients (download progress). They doesnt need a calculation for the Steps otherwise the calculation will make problems.\n- This PR adds `CalculateOnePercentofMaximum(int maxValue)` to the ProgressbarWidget\n  Example of this function how you can use them:\n\n```\nvar onePercentofmaximum = CalculateOnePercentofMaximum(FilesToCopyList.Count() - 1)\n```\n- This Pr adds an maximum value to the ProgressBar (thats important for the following) non maybe understandable sense of this PR but i will try to explain what i mean: \n- When you have 12 files (maximum = 12)\n  While the function is called, the ProgressBar will get an maximum value like 12 (we have 12 files)\n  the ProgressbarSteps for one percent will be calculated. it will return 1 in this case. In addition the Progressbar rectangle which indicated the Progress will be devided into 12 parts to get the size for 1 step\n- when you have 100 files as maximum, the ProgressBar is unscaled as like in normal \n- This PR also touches the the scaling area of the ProgressBar this is also the reason why the maximum is and has to be 100 as maximum by default when we doesnt use the Function. In this case the ProgressBar can be used normaly.\n- Also this PR adds an Overflow protection which prevents the use of higher percentage values (120%) than the Maximum value is allowing. This overflow can happen when the calculation for one percent of the maximum is wrong.\n\nFor example when you specify as maximum 100 and the ProgressBar value is above or equal the maximum the ProgressBarWidget will return the maximum as value.\n\nIn real case: The Content installer is using the file count as maximum. BUT but the ProgressBar has not realy an maximum value!, so when we have 4 files, the value for each step without the function and the maximum value is `0,04`. The calculation hast to be done elsewhere in OpenRA outside the ProgressBarWidget class. such like in the Content installer. By using this example as like in the content installer.\n\n```\nvar onePercent = 100 / files.count(); \n```\n\nNow we can do a wrong calculation by recalculating the value for one percent again a few lines later in another `foreach`and we ends with values like while we have no maximum value and overflow protection.\n\nFor example:\nRA ends at 110%\nTS is instant 100%\nCNC ends at 130%\n\nor could the value can have 200% while we expect 100%\n\nIn this case when we have a wrong step calculation which is happening in the above named example. We will have in some cases only an half filled ProgressBar and have to cheat by doing a mode swicht to marquee.... or have an ProgressBar value visualisation which is larger than our Desktop resolution, like this:\n\nOversized:\n\n```\n[=========140%============]======================\n```\n\nor Undersized:\n\n```\n[=======100%                            ]\n\n```\n\nBut in this case the ProgressBar is oversized. and can be produce bad behavor. The result of this wrong scaling happens here: https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9136/files#diff-310eea0d75516e1a7e005d1919405287L51 (The rectangle is alsways devided by 100).\n\nWe have 4 files but dividing by 100 (which is hardcoded) so we will only can have 20 percent steps of 100 percent. While the Progressbar shows 2 as value can recalculate 1 percent of 100 files In another Line elswhere in the content installer and going to continue filling the progressBar. The result is 104% and so on.\n\nPart to reviewers:\n- Test all ProgressBars without this function. That Changes should not produce bugs any bad behavor is a bug!\n\nBecause this function is a addition to and should (but not have to) be merged before #9093

Tiberian Dawn, each production building has its own tab in production palette. It is cumbersome to switch between multiple tabs. And it is not possible to see all queues at once. How about replacing this with distributed queues?\n\nIt would work like this: There is a single production tab like in Red Alert. Let's say you have multiple weapons factories. When you build a vehicle, it is queued to the primary factory. When you click on its icon again while the first one is being built, it is queued to the next free factory. The progress clock of the second vehicle is overlaid on the same icon with a different color.\n\nThis would make building things a lot easier and you would have an overview of all queues.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9127","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9127/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9127/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9127/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9127","id":102521348,"number":9127,"title":"Chrono crash, explored terrain using crate","user":{"login":"xp65","id":6690499,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6690499?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xp65","html_url":"https://github.com/xp65","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xp65/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xp65/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xp65/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xp65/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xp65/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xp65/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xp65/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xp65/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xp65/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382357,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Crash","name":"Crash","color":"e10c02","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/15","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestone/15","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/15/labels","id":1127295,"number":15,"title":"release-20150919","description":"","creator":{"login":"obrakmann","id":4331210,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4331210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann","html_url":"https://github.com/obrakmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":96,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-05-24T08:30:48Z","updated_at":"2015-12-24T15:13:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2015-09-20T11:23:40Z"},"comments":6,"created_at":"2015-08-22T09:43:41Z","updated_at":"2015-08-23T20:17:31Z","closed_at":"2015-08-23T20:17:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"release-20150614\n\nThe game crashed after I used the chrono, but to a location I normally could not, but the terrain was already explored using a special crate.

`DeployToUpgrade` and make use of it for the TS Mobile Sensor Array.\n\nThis is split into nice small commits that explain what is happening and why.\nWhile reviewing by commits is not necessary here, it would likely be easier.\n\nFirst three commits set the scene, next 4 commits add the necessary logic to `DeployToUpgrade`, and finally we have a use-case for finally using this trait.\n(_[Awesomer Mobile Sensor Array](http://i.imgur.com/pBfXvvA.gif) is back!!_)\n\nNotes:\n- [x] The Mobile Sensor Array's deployed version (along with the deploy animation) has half a cell vertical offset. I noticed this after rebasing, and as shown in the gif, it wasn't an issue several months ago. Also not present in the normal `gadpsa`.\n- [x] The original has `RadarInvisible=yes` as shown [here](https://github.com/LipkeGu/TSIniFiles/blob/4cc5adac88b012e27a6a82ba7c93d182451d9d64/rules.ini#L2073), so I've [removed](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9124/files#diff-20162b6ff85d8da38c40f5095744bad2R152) the `AppearsOnRadar` trait. But do we actually want this?\n\nWhen this is all over I will remove the current mobile sensor array in favor of the new one (but keep the original name and tooltip, of course).\nAfter that Tick tanks and Nod Artilleries can be done as well, thanks to @reaperrr's efforts (and mine :P ) toward making the necessary traits upgradable. (Ofc RA2 GIs can also be done now.)\n\nCloses  #8932.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9124/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9123","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9123/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9123/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9123/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9123","id":102345545,"number":9123,"title":"add myself to AUTHORS","user":{"login":"clemty","id":10729559,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10729559?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemty","html_url":"https://github.com/clemty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemty/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-08-21T10:07:31Z","updated_at":"2015-09-05T13:34:14Z","closed_at":"2015-08-21T10:38:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/9123","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9123","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9123.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9123.patch"},"body":"as suggested in #8528\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9123/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9122","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9122/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9122/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9122/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9122","id":102275711,"number":9122,"title":"Show custom map rules in lobby","user":{"login":"deniz1a","id":6599106,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6599106?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a","html_url":"https://github.com/deniz1a","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382420,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Idea/Wishlist","name":"Idea/Wishlist","color":"e102d8","default":false},{"id":124120259,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/UI","name":"UI","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-08-21T01:39:39Z","updated_at":"2015-08-22T10:03:47Z","closed_at":"2015-08-22T10:03:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If a map has custom rules, there is a warning in lobby.

Although I can't remember if TS used this, the RA2 Flak weaponry was notorious of having around 0c300 inaccuracy even at point-blank range while being a Bullet weapon.\n- Modders might try to use high-burst inaccurate bullet-based weapons, which end up impossible to balance - perfect example is @DoGyAUT's Wolverine at http://media.moddb.com/images/mods/1/15/14166/wolverine.gif - resulting either being overpowered in close-range either underpowered at max range.\n\nThis PR adds a `ScaleInaccurancyWithRange` option to bullets and missiles, with a default value of `true`, while also brings an upgrade rule for missiles to not change their behaviour.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9114","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9114/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9114/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9114/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9114","id":102105399,"number":9114,"title":"CPU arch warnings on Win8.1 x64","user":{"login":"reaperrr","id":2857877,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2857877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperrr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":95766782,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Easy","name":"Easy","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":189987508,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/OS:%20Windows","name":"OS: Windows","color":"5e9fe7","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":23,"created_at":"2015-08-20T09:58:24Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T22:59:05Z","closed_at":"2016-05-27T17:44:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Presumably on Win10, too.\n\nOn newer x64 Windows versions, msbuild seems to default to AMD64 rather than x86, resulting in a total of 36 warnings.\n\nIt doesn't seem to cause any serious issues, but the warnings are still annoying, we should investigate whether `make.cmd/make.ps1` can be configured to silence them.\n\nEdit: The problem is that for some reason, sometimes the x86 reference assemblies for the targeted .NET version seem to be missing. One way to adress that, now that we use .NET 4.5:\n- Download and install https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42637\n- Go to `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Reference Assemblies\\Microsoft\\Framework\\.NETFramework`. Most likely, there will now be a folder named `v4.5.2`, but not a folder named `v4.5`.\n- Make a copy of the `v4.5.2` folder, and rename the copied folder to `v4.5`.\n- Done.\n##
