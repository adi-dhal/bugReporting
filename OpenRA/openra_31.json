current hardcoded behaviour of weapons with more than 1 Burst has two caveats that might be fine for our shipping mods (for the most part), but can get annoying for 3rd-party mods and prevent some balance-sensitive fixes to some weapons in our shipping mods, too (we could get rid of all these delayed warheads on the RA vulcan if these limitations were adressed).\r\n\r\nThose caveats are:\r\n- [ ] as soon as the original target is killed, the attacking actor either immediately fires any remaining bursts at the next available target(s), or immediately stops shooting (if no other target is present).\r\n- [ ] depleted bursts are not replenished until all remaining bursts have been fired.\r\n\r\nIdeally, it should be optionally possible to make weapons\r\n- fire any remaining bursts at the last position of the killed target and only switch to next target after that (would allow using `Burst: 5` instead of delayed warheads on RA vulcan, and \"feel more right\" for RA cruisers and TS Juggernauts, too)\r\n- make all depleted bursts replenish after a cooldown (Weapon.ReloadDelay after last burst was fired, normally) even if there were bursts remaining\r\n\r\nAlternatives:\r\n- somewhat hacky, but easy: if target was destroyed, set remaining bursts to zero and trigger reloading\r\n- Propose the use of `AmmoPool` to fix the 2nd caveat (although that still wouldn't adress the 1st).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13220/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13219","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13219/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13219/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13219/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13219","id":225428053,"number":13219,"title":"Fix

You get access to airstrikes in the third mission of the GDI campaign which is pretty much a tutorial mission since you're still learning how everything works.\r\n\r\nI know in cnc.net they had an option to turn on/off airstrikes from the menu before matches in case players wanted to have matches with them but, without superweapons.\r\nPlayers should be able to utilize them at any tech level that grants access to the Comm.

far, the new updates been working pretty well but, the AI's base building skills still needs some work.\r\nThe AI always builds Maginot Lines. \r\nIn layman's terms, it always builds defenses in a straight line along one side of the base's farthest boundaries and disregards building them inside their base or any other side of their base if the opponents set starting point isn't nearby that side of the base; along forces to easily flank them (given the terrain allows them to).\r\nAdditionally, the AI always packs its defenses next to each other in an almost modular layout with little to no space between them.\r\n \r\nWhile I'm not sure how programming AI works, I just thought I'd bring it to attention for the sake of players that play more offline than online. \r\n\r\nHere's some examples from Tiberian Dawn:\r\n![line defense](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25542788/25445701/0a710206-2a7d-11e7-81aa-0aeaefec3b67.png)\r\n\r\nThe GDI base in this image is directly south of the NOD base in the first image.\r\n![maginot gdi](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25542788/25446142/9642fec8-2a7e-11e7-827f-d5d647bfa483.png)\r\n\r\nHere's an example in RA on Path Beyond.\r\n![ra maginot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25542788/25446774/a4322de0-2a80-11e7-8a1b-7afdfad43526.png)\r\nTo clarify that neither of the bases are mine, I don't have a War Factory built yet so I don't have access to Tesla Coils yet. \r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure if it's scripted for the AI to instinctively build it's defenses in a straight line based on which direction it is in relation to enemy's starting point but, the method seems a bit too consistent. \r\n\r\nSeeing as neither OpenRA or OpenCNC use the original building system (build out as far as the terrain allows until it looks like you spilled paint on a map), I could recommend one possible way of fixing this for both the AI and base-centric players (like myself). Heck, if every player wasn't so set in Rush tactics, I'd build a base as elaborate as the one in the RA shellmap if I was given enough time to.\r\n(random note: I actually made a sandbox map just to showcase the examples below)\r\n\r\n![example 1 2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25542788/25447827/976461b0-2a84-11e7-85f3-6225edd1aff2.png)\r\n\r\nTo prevent AI and players from building their bases so far apart that they can't place defenses near base structures, give regular building their own \"build circle\" in which defense structures can be placed even if the circle reaches outside of the base's \"build circle\". That way the defenses aren't always outlining the base limits with vital structures being left uncomfortably close to No Man's Land (essentially everything outside of the build circle). \r\nI noticed this method sort of applies with walls but, maybe base defenses could use a similar mechanic since most of the time you'll end up with a maze of sandbags just outside of where all your base defenses are.\r\n\r\nBy implementing this, the could be less defense edging and instead, more diverse layouts.\r\n![example 1 3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25542788/25448339/197296e4-2a86-11e7-9cad-4b0d3b8df0c5.png)\r\n\r\nGoing back to how the old build system isn't present, since there's no way to build near captured buildings like in Red Alert 2, defense circles could be used for captureable structures as well. \r\nThat way, there isn't too much micromanagement with reinforcing defenseless buildings with infantry and tanks.\r\n\r\nBefore\r\n![field barn](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25542788/25451615/c424a6f4-2a90-11e7-9bfc-bc7fa02027d9.png)\r\nAfter\r\n![tech defense](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25542788/25448902/1066d6d0-2a88-11e7-8741-71573bea51ba.png)\r\n\r\nIn terms of actual habits that could be implemented for the AI, here's some ways to improve on it.\r\nI know the \"Turtle\" AI just spams defenses more that anything else but, maybe it could be given some techniques borrowed from Red Alert 2 like building fortified perimeters around vital structures and superweapons. \r\n\r\n![fortified buildings](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25542788/25449816/001f0c4a-2a8b-11e7-9733-d983bfdf4d7b.png)\r\n\r\nBack in Red Alert 2, the AI had a tendency to box-in their superweapons so they couldn't be sabotaged or immediately hit by tank rounds. In OpenRA it could be taken a step further by programming the AI to build a perimeter and even a small pocket of defenses around the superweapon to make Orca and Apache raids less cheap when playing offline.\r\n\r\n-----\r\nOne other thing I noticed is that the AI only builds enough power plants to support almost exactly the amount it needs and never any emergency backup power. I could be mistaken with this observation though because I tend to lose track of how many power plants I destroy. Just thought I'd mention this since it sort of affects the defenses.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAgain, I know nothing about programming outside of the bare minimum but, I just thought I'd share my idea to help the game grow even further. I'm still experimenting with the game's AI to see how much it's changed since the previous version and I can say the pathfinding has definitely improved because it doesn't get stuck at long cliff lines as often as it used to and the \"fast vehicle behind slow vehicle humping\" seems to have died down a bit (not sure if it was actually fixed but, it seems like something changed). What I'm trying to say is \"nice work on the update\". \r\n\r\nDo whatever you wish with my feedback. It's your game :)
