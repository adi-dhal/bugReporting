noticed several times that AI players will become completely ineffective after ore trucks stop harvesting. No amount of poking or prodding will help them \"get with the program.\" Sometimes this is drawn by scarcity of resource, but then ore regenerates and the collection should be initiated again. Perhaps a backoff timer to scan for nearby ore in discovered/monitored map space instead of a complete idle scenario would be better? There is nothing less satisfying than defeating an AI that has incapacitated itself for minutes on end with a ton of nearby resources and no good reason. From my observations, it can happen with any AI style. Even more of an issue with allies who slowly let themselves be killed off. I've seen them stall out despite infusion with cash trucks just for
