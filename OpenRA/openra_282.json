automatically by VS (it assumes these values by default, and these match the makefile).\n- The CrashDialog project can reuse the icon from the Game project as long as the path is set correctly.\n- Fix TS project so it builds (I know it's going but it's annoying that the project must be unloaded).\n\nI checked out this branch into a clean directory and rebuilt to ensure I didn't break anything this

it is====\nIt would be useful for us older folks if for the ProductionQueue trait (one that causes multiple build queues) had an associated 'global' queue, that when a production order is given through it, automatically assigns the production order to the next least busy queue (i.e. least amounts of ticks left before its production finishes).\n\n--Example--\nYou want to build 5 harvesters simultaneously. You have 5 idle war factories.\nCurrently you have to go to each queue, and click on harvester once in each.\nWith the multiplex UI queue you would see a queue 'G', which if you shift-click on harvester in it, will order each queue to build 1 harvester.\n\n--Example--\nYou want to build 3 harvesters simultaneously. You have 2 idle war factories.\nYou click once on harvester in the multiplex UI queue. It assigns a harvester to queue 1.\nYou click once on harvester in the multiplex UI queue. Queue 1 is already busy, so it checks queue 2. It assigns 1 harvester to queue 2.\nYou click once on harvester in the multiplex UI queue. Queue 1 is already busy and 1% done. Queue 2 is busy and 0% done. It assigns a harvester to queue 1.\n\n====Showing progress====\nThe multiplex queue would only show you the progress of the most completed production item, showing other queued items simply as numbers for queued up production as per normal.\nOnce production completes (and unit exits/player places building) the queue updates with the next most completed production, if any.\n\n--Example--\nYou have 2 construction yards. You are busy building both a refinery (99% done) and a war factory (70% done).\nThe refinery finishes and shows ready. The war factory still shows as a 1 in the queue, you cannot see its progress unless you go to the relevant build queue.\nYou place the refinery. The multiplex queue updates and shows the war factory is currently 75% done.\n\n--Example--\nYou have 5 construction yards. You shift-queued 5 silos. All 5 finish during the same tick.\nThe multiplex shows you a silo is ready, and 4 more are queued.\nYou place one. It immediately shows you another is ready, with 3 more queued.\nEtc.\n\n<bountysource-plugin>\n\n---\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Place a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/2711429-idea-multiplex-ui-for-productionqueue?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5661/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5660","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5660/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5660/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5660/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5660","id":35972276,"number":5660,"title":"Documented some order related traits","user":{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-06-18T10:32:44Z","updated_at":"2014-06-20T13:43:28Z","closed_at":"2014-06-20T13:27:11Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/5660","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5660","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5660.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5660.patch"},"body":"There are still some more that could need a descriptive line. https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Traits\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5660/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5659","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5659/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5659/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5659/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5659","id":35970445,"number":5659,"title":"Confused Capture System.","user":{"login":"AoAGeneral","id":7693928,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7693928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral","html_url":"https://github.com/AoAGeneral","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382400,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"d7e102","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-06-18T10:04:03Z","updated_at":"2014-06-18T10:33:30Z","closed_at":"2014-06-18T10:33:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You play as GDI.
