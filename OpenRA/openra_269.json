have no idea what real-world impact on performance the speed modifier has, but since I recently stumbled over an article which said that decimal is 128-bit pecision and purely done in software, and therefore about 15-20x as expensive in terms of performance as float, I started to wonder.\n\nI assume the higher precision over float is needed, otherwise there would have been no point in using it, but is the performance impact in practice low enough to leave it be or might it be worth investigating to use pure integer instead (for example setting absolute malus values for terrain speeds, harvester full speed, etc, and absolute bonus values for experience level ups, ScaredyCat etc.)?\n\nJust curious.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6076","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6076/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6076/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6076/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6076","id":38824149,"number":6076,"title":"Tesla

trying to make spectator team chat to fix #2062, I came across this limitation:\n\nThe variable disableTeamChat in IngameChatLogic.cs is set at the game start. But it needs to be adjustable according to the game state. For example, in an FFA game, a player that is dead should be able to team chat with other spectators or dead players. To do that, team chat has to be made available when player WinState changes. Or when other spectators disconnect and only one remains, team chat should be turned off. So team chat availability should be determined for every player at each tick. And the ingame chat window should also take this into account when team chat gets disabled while the chat window is

PR adds support for mission objectives.\n\nFixes #4541, #5499, #6081, #5501.\n\nMission objectives can be either primary or secondary objectives. The game is won when all primary objectives have been completed, or lost when any primary objective is failed. Secondary objectives do not influence the outcome of a game.\n\nThe decision whether an objective is completed or failed lies in the hands of map scripts (or the existing *VictoryConditions traits). The back-end only stores the information about the objectives. It **_does**_ however decide when a game is over.\n\nThe MissionObjectives trait can be configured to some degree to accommodate different game modes.  The defaults are suited for classic Skirmish multi-player games.\n- The _EarlyGameOver_ flag causes games to finish as soon as the first player has either failed or completed his objectives. If unset, the players would become observers instead to let the remaining players duke it out. You obviously want to have this set on single player missions.\n- The _Cooperative_ flag is meant for cooperative multi-player missions, and especially those where the players in a team have different sets of objectives. If set, this flag delays registering a win for a player that has completed his objectives until all of his team mates have also completed theirs. The reverse is true as well, where a single player that fails any of his primary objectives causes the whole team to lose. If used in conjunction with the _EarlyGameOver_ flag, the rules explained in the previous bullet point apply to the whole team, not individual players.\n\nAlong with the back-end comes a front-end GUI panel that is tied in to the in-game options menu.\nIt's a tabbed window that can show:\n- the map description and preview image, if any (as in: requires a preview image to be shown)\n- either a statistics tab (the existing one from TD, actually), or a tab with the list of objectives and their status.  Which one is shown depends on the value of the _PanelName_ property of the World's _ObjectivesPanel_ trait (see trait documentation).\n- the debugging options (still shortcut-accessible)\n\nAlso introduced with this PR is a new dialog that pops up when a game is over, sort of like a tally screen. It shows either the statistics or the objectives list mentioned above, or nothing if those aren't available (like in a replay, or when they are not configured). The dialog allows you to leave the game and exit to the main menu, and nothing else. It's not possible to return to the game.\n\nNotes:\n- Breaking change: maps using StrategicVictoryConditions must not use ConquestVictoryConditions any longer. I found only two KotH maps on the resource site, though, and both are currently already broken.\n- What's missing is a sound notification when a new objective is added. Currently, only the _Options_ button blinks in that case.\n\nOther stuff that fell out of these changes:\n- it is now possible to unregister event handlers using the Lua API.\n- the surrender button is now disabled instead of invisible when not applicable\n- it is now possible to surrender even in scripted maps\n- some ui logic cleanups\n- some additions to our Lua API, and a converted gdi01 as a test case, thanks to @Mailaender.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6059/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6058","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6058/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6058/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6058/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6058","id":38694559,"number":6058,"title":"Installing

#4682 added radar beacons for events such as harvesters being attacked or superweapons that can be jumped to by pressing spacebar. This could be expanded upon.\n\nRed Alert 2 features jumping to announced events without beacons attached such as units having their construction completed or being destroyed. As such, the spacebar is the counterpart to the voice announcer, allowing the player to quickly find out what in particular is the subject of the announcement. I propose adding non-radar event locations for announced events. In particular, the \"unit lost\" event is very useful for jumping to surprise attacks.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on
