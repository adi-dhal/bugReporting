Fixes #11073.\n\nAnother difference between this implementation and the old one is that the new one will keep repeating the warning (at the interval of the delay) until funds are available again.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11076/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11075","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11075/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11075/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11075/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11075","id":146985573,"number":11075,"title":"TD SAM Site and Advanced Guard Tower delay before building cost applies","user":{"login":"AidanTallon","id":14836442,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/14836442?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanTallon","html_url":"https://github.com/AidanTallon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanTallon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanTallon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanTallon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanTallon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanTallon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanTallon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanTallon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanTallon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AidanTallon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382400,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"d7e102","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-04-08T17:09:49Z","updated_at":"2016-06-29T20:27:06Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"When building these, the building process starts but money isn't taken from the player until construction is about 1/8th done.
