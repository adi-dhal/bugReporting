is back.\n\nSpeculative fix for #5116 by implementing IDisposable on Texture, FrameBuffer and VertexBuffer rather than relying on the finalizer to do the work since the non-determinism of finalization means these resources could be hanging around for an unbounded length of time before being released. I don't have any particular proof that this will fix the out-of-memory issue, it just seems like it could be a possible cause.\n\nTo verify, you can stick some console logging in the finalizers for these methods. On bleed you should notice a lot of activity as you load assets (loading, switching mods, choosing maps, starting & ending a game). This PR fixes all but one inconsequential leak as far as I can tell (the leak is the static SheetBuilder in SprintFont, but since the textures are needed forever it hardly matters).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6829","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6829/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6829/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6829/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6829","id":46756015,"number":6829,"title":"Per-Player handicap","user":{"login":"epicelite","id":2596563,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2596563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epicelite","html_url":"https://github.com/epicelite","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epicelite/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epicelite/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epicelite/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epicelite/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epicelite/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epicelite/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epicelite/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epicelite/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epicelite/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382420,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Idea/Wishlist","name":"Idea/Wishlist","color":"e102d8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-10-24T16:19:59Z","updated_at":"2015-04-26T05:45:46Z","closed_at":"2014-12-30T00:31:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Maybe players can choose a handicap for themselves for extra challenge against weaker opponents?\n\nMaybe they can set their tech level lower then the other players just for starters?\n\n<bountysource-plugin>\n\n---\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Place a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/5500714-idea-per-player-handicap?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4757","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"897F:572C:15DF51A:2B72879:59D6B5D9","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=244>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=405>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=242>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"e27cb009e99e63dfd34c1237e63a4fe5\"","status":"200 OK"}}
