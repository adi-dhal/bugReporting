As far as possible, make `Common` features that 3rd-party mods might want to modify overridable if they aren't already, so direct modifications of `Common` become unnecessary most of the time\n2. Introduce an additional `Unsupported` mod dll to OpenRA, where features not needed by TS and the shipping mods, but potentially useful for several external mods, can be added more easily\n\nThis new `Unsupported` dll would not be used by any of the official mods, with 'unsupported' meaning\n- features or default values can be changed, renamed or removed without repercussions or the need for upgrade rules if there's a solid reason (modders that use any of these features should be aware of its 'beta' and DIY nature)\n- generally more lenience when accepting new features to this dll (still requiring +2, adherance to StyleCop and no unresolved issues if possible, but not requiring upgrade rules or completely hack-free code)\n- could also be used as proving ground for features deemed potentially useful to the shipping mods, but too risky to accept into `Common` as-is\n- if a feature has been tested enough and is considered useful and 'safe', it could be moved down to `Common` later\n\nUltimately, the idea is to \n- lower the hurdle for less experienced external contributors to get their features merged\n- increase the pace and probability of new features being merged in general\n- increase sharing of work and ideas between makers of external mods, reducing the _\"everyone cooking their own soup\"_ effect\n- avoid regressions in the first-party mods without rejecting/blocking features for or in external mods\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11812","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11812/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11812/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11812/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11812","id":170868473,"number":11812,"title":"Fix
