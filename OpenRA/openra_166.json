noticed arbitrary lag spikes caused by projectiles.\n\nOn my notebook with i5-4210M (and presumably some throttling even in 'performance' mode) the `Bullet` effect (sometimes Missile, too, but less pronounced) occasionally eats up to 80 ms on RA's shellmap in performance mode (and much more, sometimes over 300(!)ms in balanced/power-saving mode).\n\nAnd while far less of an issue there, even on my i5-2500 main rig the projectiles cause occasional 10-20ms spikes.\nTheir appearance seems to be quite random, so I wonder whether it's only some specific part of the code that causes this.\n\nA while ago I tried to find the exact cause by disabling the ShouldExplode checks and some effects (contrail, trail) one by one, but none of those improved the situation significantly (if at all).\n\nThose hiccups can be quite annoying on slower systems, so it would be nice if someone managed to track down and get rid of the cause.\n\nEdit: It appears it's not the projectile itself, but the stuff happening on impact (warheads).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9142/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9141","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9141/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9141/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9141/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9141","id":102622140,"number":9141,"title":"Improve
