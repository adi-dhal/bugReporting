up on #11333)\n\nGood evening OpenRA developers,\n\nAs per obrakmann's request, I am submitting a new bug report with additional information about this problem.\n\nTo reiterate, when playing a skirmish battle in Dune 2000, the game crashes to desktop after about 30-45 minutes of gameplay.  \n\nAs it turns out, the game does not write any information to exception.log when this occurs.  Rather, the crash seems to be due to a .NET error, as two Application error logs are written into the Event Viewer after the crash occurs.\n\nThis instance of the crash occurred on a desktop computer running Windows XP Professional x64 with a GeForce GTX 280 (Driver Version 6.14.13.681, Driver Date 9/23/2012), but I have also encountered this same problem on a laptop computer running Windows 7 Professional x64 with a GeForce 9800M GTS (Driver Version 9.18.13.623, Driver Date 8/30/2012).\n\nI have attached screenshots of the battle setup I used for this particular battle and the .NET Application errors I found in my Event Viewer.\n\nOnce again, thank you in advance for any help you can provide!\n![openra d2k game setup](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19510851/15457675/8f18a784-205b-11e6-9b6c-b65e790811e6.PNG)\n![event viewer error 1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19510851/15457673/8f16bbf4-205b-11e6-931f-f51c817b4f33.PNG)\n![event viewer error 2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19510851/15457674/8f170690-205b-11e6-88b0-dd15e2bd5d9c.PNG)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11344","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11344/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11344/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11344/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11344","id":156181794,"number":11344,"title":"OpenRA.Utility.exe ra --extract does not work as described on linux","user":{"login":"nice-hat","id":19522439,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/19522439?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nice-hat","html_url":"https://github.com/nice-hat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nice-hat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nice-hat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nice-hat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nice-hat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nice-hat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nice-hat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nice-hat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nice-hat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nice-hat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382400,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"d7e102","default":false},{"id":32800462,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Utility","name":"Utility","color":"000000","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2016-05-23T00:22:42Z","updated_at":"2016-06-15T20:53:42Z","closed_at":"2016-06-15T20:53:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"OpenRA.Utility.exe ra --extract does not work as described here: https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Game-Content on a debian GNU/linux system.

from [various](http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=82&t=19498&start=75&postdays=0&postorder=asc&highlight=) RA balance [threads](#10437) there seems to be a consensus that the MiG and Longbow could do with some buffs. This PR does NOT introduce mig AA weaponry. I think @SoScared made [some very good points](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10437#issuecomment-171100185) about the possible balance affects of giving Migs AA.\n\nI am instead suggesting to balance these units by fixing some of the issues I have discovered through testing, which in turn should give them a better defined role in the game. With these changes, they should be pretty good investments for sniping mobile armour while matching their cheaper counterparts vs buildings.\n\n**Issue 1.** In the current release the longbow anti ground missile has one cell less range than the hind chaingun. Now both are equal. \n\n**Issue 2.** Missiles for both the MiG and the longbow would explode just after their max range. This made damaging moving targets nearly impossible without somewhat fiddly micro. This has now been fixed. Rangers are the only land unit fast enough to evade rockets fairly reliably while APCs can travel the furthest before being hit.\n\n**Issue 3.** A single hind and yak in the current release does more damage to _nearly every building in the game_ compared to a single Mig or LB. Now Migs and LBs do slightly more damage overall to most buildings compared to their cheaper counterparts and twice the damage to concrete walls as before.\n\n**Balance 1.** The longbow now fires in a volley of 4 rockets instead of 2, buts its cool-down between volleys has been increased by 40%. This is still an overall buff and makes the LB more useful for hit and run. This will hopefully make Allied late game a little more interesting.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11337/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11336","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11336/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11336/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11336/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11336","id":156146639,"number":11336,"title":"Fix mpspawn ownership","user":{"login":"obrakmann","id":4331210,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4331210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann","html_url":"https://github.com/obrakmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-05-22T10:59:30Z","updated_at":"2016-05-22T22:43:05Z","closed_at":"2016-05-22T22:38:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/11336","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11336","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11336.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11336.patch"},"body":"Fixes #11333.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11335","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11335/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11335/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11335/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11335","id":156133382,"number":11335,"title":"Spies Can Be Seen","user":{"login":"bratwiz","id":993120,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/993120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bratwiz","html_url":"https://github.com/bratwiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bratwiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bratwiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bratwiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bratwiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bratwiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bratwiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bratwiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bratwiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bratwiz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":95646850,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Question%20/%20Support","name":"Question / Support","color":"d4c5f9","default":false},{"id":21877809,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Red%20Alert","name":"Red Alert","color":"8B0000","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-05-22T03:53:21Z","updated_at":"2016-05-22T23:41:45Z","closed_at":"2016-05-22T12:30:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm playing the latest stable release 20160508 and apparently spies can be seen.
