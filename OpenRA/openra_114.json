It will increase the map size but it is easily compressed, maybe simple run length encoding will be enough.\n2) If the map starts with a destroyed bridge, you end up with separate domains which is good for performance (early rejection before heavier path finding). When the bridge is repaired it creates a permanent connection between the domains to not reject path finding across those domains but when it is destroyed again those connections are not removed so you lose that benefit and will do heavier path finding each time after.\n3) If the map starts with a bridge not destroyed it creates a single domain between both sides of the bridge, it loses out on the early rejection from #2 when the bridge is destroyed. It will do a heavier path search if there are no connection between both sides of the bridge.\n\nSo for #2 and #3, it would make sense that bridges are somehow ignored when building a domain index, separating both sides of a bridge into separate domains (unless there is a non-bridge connection between both sides of course). Bridge tiles getting their own domain value would probably work best for that and will also benefit in early rejecting trying to path to a destroyed bridge. And 'living' bridges would reference connections between domains, if a bridge is destroyed it dereferences the connection, and the connection is removed when there are zero references (zero bridges between domains).\n\nI'm thinking on working on this when I get some time, maybe do some profiling first, but I wanted to throw it on here first.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue?

The changes are partially aesthetic and some balance related. This may or may not give the map new life but in any case they will look much better in the map chooser and in-game. If we are to hold on to the classic maps, they should at least be up to par with competing maps on aesthetics and balance. I've done my best to preserve as much of the maps' original character with the recommended changes.\n\nSeparate issues will eventually be submitted for each map for a final review and chance for additional discussion. All maps have been thoroughly playtested and altered after feedback from players before being submitted individually.\n\nMap and author names should stay unchanged unless the map is altered a lot beyond it's original structure.\n\n**Map list:**\n\nScreenshots and comparisons are found on the altered maps' pages.\n\n[**Forest Path**](http://resource.openra.net/maps/7295/) (2 players)\nMove player spawns one cell away horizontally from the ore patches.\nChange layout of actors around secondary ore patches to equalize access for both spawns.\nSwitch out actors (trees) to vary the fauna.\n[Altered](http://resource.openra.net/maps/9138)\n**Playtested, submitted at #10928**\n\n[**Keep Off The Grass 2**](http://resource.openra.net/maps/7242/) (2 players)\nMove the first ore patch for both spawns to balance ore access.\n[Altered](http://resource.openra.net/maps/9542/) *updated to revision 5, March 29th\nalso see #10347 \n\n**Playtested, submitted at #10954**\n\n[**Man to Man**](http://resource.openra.net/maps/7196/) (2 players)\nRemove oil derricks -or- access them by bridge.\n[Altered](http://resource.openra.net/maps/9230/)\nalso see #10312\n**Playtested, submitted at #10953**\n\n[**Sidestep**](http://resource.openra.net/maps/8176/) (2 players)\nAdd edge ridges for more distinction.\nAdd more roads, actors and debris to make the map less blank.\n[Altered](http://resource.openra.net/maps/9353/)\n**Playtested, submitted at #10927**\n\n[**Singles**](http://resource.openra.net/maps/7353/) (2 players)\nMap structure overhaul. see #10301\nWork on balance and aesthetics.\n[Altered](http://resource.openra.net/maps/9487)\n**Playtested, submitted at #10987**\n\n[**Snowy Ridge**](http://resource.openra.net/maps/7996/) (3 players)\nMove the first ore patch for all spawns to balance ore access.\nMove horizontal ridge north to equalize size of north/south fields.\n[Altered](http://resource.openra.net/maps/9373/)\nalso see #10712\n**Playtested, submitted at #10952**\n\n[**Doubles**](http://resource.openra.net/maps/7153/) (4 players)\nMap structure overhaul. see #10303\nWork on balance and aesthetics.\n[Altered](http://resource.openra.net/maps/9489/)\n**Playtested, submitted at #10988**\n\n[**Chokepoint**](http://resource.openra.net/maps/7285/) (4 players)\nMake the corners' cliff and ore more symmetrical.\nNarrow the top water a little on it's west side so player A and D symmetrically has equal fields towards the chokes.\n[Altered](http://resource.openra.net/maps/8920/)\n**Playtested, submitted at #10833**\n\n[**East vs West**](http://resource.openra.net/maps/7583/) (4 players)\nAdd more detail scenery.\nTweak spawn spots so as making them distinguishable in the lobby.\n[Altered](http://resource.openra.net/maps/9367/)\n**Playtested, submitted at #10950**\n\n[**Temperal**](http://resource.openra.net/maps/7233/) (4 players)\nAdd actors and debris to out-of-reach and vacant areas.\nSlightly tweak the north players poor economic start position.\n[Altered](http://resource.openra.net/maps/9456/)\n**Playtested, submitted at #10980**\n\n[**Asymmetric Battle**](http://resource.openra.net/maps/6790/) (6 players)\nAdd actors (trees) to areas unlikely to be used for base-building and battle.\n[Altered](http://resource.openra.net/maps/9157/)\n**Playtested, submitted at #10951**\n\n[**Encounter**](http://resource.openra.net/maps/7290/) (6 players) \nMake the corner ridges more symmetrical.\nMake all ridges more distinctive.\nBalance east/west ore patches for corner player spawns.\n[Altered](http://resource.openra.net/maps/9516/)\n**Playtested, submitted at #10798**\n\n[**High & Low**](http://resource.openra.net/maps/7999/) - 8 players\nEast/west are uneven in build areas, distance to deploy site and the map is slightly offset from the middle.

Raraku is a monstrosity and is suggested for removal in #10708. Imo, Raraku looks hideous, the map itself and in the map chooser, but also has poor options for team play and FFA. Caffeinated on the other hand looks decent as a non-symmetrical map, has multiple options for team-play, even multiple 4v4 positions. Personally, the games I remember on this map was generally fun. The are numerous maps  in the map pool currently that should be dumped _way_ before Caffeinated.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/30615640-ra-the-official-map-pool-in-with-the-new?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10710/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10709","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10709/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10709/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10709/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10709","id":131916986,"number":10709,"title":"Default Game Speed doesn't change?","user":{"login":"Templarfreak","id":2140802,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2140802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Templarfreak","html_url":"https://github.com/Templarfreak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Templarfreak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Templarfreak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Templarfreak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Templarfreak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Templarfreak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Templarfreak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Templarfreak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Templarfreak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Templarfreak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382400,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"d7e102","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-02-07T00:50:03Z","updated_at":"2016-10-01T11:02:35Z","closed_at":"2016-10-01T11:02:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"So, I wanted to make the Fastest game speed the default.

unifies our handling of mod/package specific files with common code in the virtual file system.\n\nThere are three new/changed syntax elements for use in yaml:\n1. `explicit-name|file` specifies that `file` should be loaded from the package that has been explicitly named `explicit-name`.\n2. `package: explicit-name` in the `Packages:` section of `mod.yaml` defines an explicitly named package that can be referenced using the `|` syntax.\n3. `$mod` in the `Packages:` section of `mod.yaml` defines that the mod named `mod` should be mounted as a package.  Mods may be loaded from either the system or support dirs, and will eventually support both unpacked and oramods.\n\nAs a compromise based on the earlier discussions/arguments I have changed the explicit package operator from `:` to `|` and reverted the change for `MapFolders`.\n\nThis has the side-effect of making all our default mods portable between the system and support directories.\n\nSupersedes #10487.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10703/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10702","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10702/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10702/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10702/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10702","id":131882339,"number":10702,"title":"Fix Map.Contains for maps with height","user":{"login":"RoosterDragon","id":3399086,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3399086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon","html_url":"https://github.com/RoosterDragon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-02-06T18:05:00Z","updated_at":"2016-02-06T22:05:04Z","closed_at":"2016-02-06T22:02:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/10702","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10702","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10702.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10702.patch"},"body":"Fixes #10460.\nFixes #10698.\nFixes OpenRA/ra2#85.\n\nChanged the logic so a cell with no valid projected cells is now considered off the map -
