of the reasons for migrating all the code from `OpenRA.Mods.RA` to `OpenRA.Mods.Common` was that a mod should not depend on another mod in any way (for the official mods, at least).\nBut I see

./mods/d2k/OpenRA.Mods.D2k.dll\n\nOnce the migration to `Mods.Common` is complete each mod should reference only the common DLL and its own.\nPutting this here so I don't forget about it as
