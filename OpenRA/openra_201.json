with `Buildable.BuildLimit > 0` automatically provide their name as build prerequisite in a quite hacky manner, as seen

that as well, and that was considered (correctly) a hack.\nRelated to #5287.\n\nMy opinion is that someone should add an upgrade rule to add `ProvidesPrerequisite` to every actor that has `Buildable.BuildLimit > 0` and remove the code linked above, so prerequisite granting can finally be consistent and only explicit.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a

Before this fix, the idle dish animation would start at the wrong frame, so there would be a noticable misalignment between the end of the make animation and \"start\" of the idle overlay.\n\nThis is because before this fix, the idle overlay was just not drawn, but not actually stopped/disabled, so (assuming identical Tick rate) if the make anim was 15 frames, and the idle overlay 30 frames, the overlay would \"start\" at frame 16 once the make anim finished.\n\nWith this fix, the idle overlay is properly stopped/disabled until the build is complete/make anim finishes, and then starts with the first frame.\n\nFixes starting frame for all buildings with idle overlays (mostly affects TS).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8109/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8108","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8108/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8108/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8108/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8108","id":74325477,"number":8108,"title":"WithIdleOverlay

months ago, the D2k map importer was merged.\nShortly before it was, I took the screenshot found [here](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5875#issuecomment-67397799), ingame from a map I had imported with it. Notice how there are no obvious visual problems.\n![](http://i.imgur.com/BPfq1xA.png)\n\nToday I tried to import the same map using the latest bleed (commit a310411bcc70dce87d63d115862583a7b2af6265).\nThe result was:\n![](http://i.imgur.com/yXShwGU.png)\n\nI then checked out the branch that the map importer was merged from (commit 922af4d9cf0b99942f6b0823b16691782e8ddb33, 3 months ago) and reimported the map. The result was this:\n![](http://i.imgur.com/pGLEACb.png)\n\n**And finally, this is how the map _should_ look:**\n\n![](http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b215/pa-pa-pa/mapYYYY-12-DD_06-30-35.png)\n\nObviously even the originally imported map was not perfect, but it was much, much better than what bleed imported today.\n\n**EDIT:** The map importer was merged on 18.02. The 28.03 playtest produces the same results as current bleed, which means the situation regressed during the first 5 weeks after it was merged. This seriously cuts down on commits that need to be checked.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8089/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4799","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"8593:572C:15DA2B1:2B684EB:59D6B536","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=202>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=405>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=200>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"0da3ac4894169e37b94e5e382e7e8923\"","status":"200 OK"}}
