of the arguments for removing the runtime mod merging was that files of the shipping mods could be referenced to via mod.yaml.\n\nHowever, system.yaml is a file any larger mod will have to edit (to make AI use new units, for example), so any engine change that adds some trait under Player: or World: that would crash the game if missing makes life harder for modders when updating the engine.\n\nMy suggestion would be to put all engine stuff that just needs to be there but doesn't provide any changeable stuff to modders (Player: -> GpsWatcher, World: -> ActorMap etc.) in one file, and everything that modders might want to edit (production queue settings, HackyAI settings, resource settings, Crate settings etc.) into one or more separate file(s).\n\nThis may be less convenient for the devs, but would make life much easier for modders as they could always reference the RA system.yaml (maybe it could even be moved under 'common') with all the required engine stuff and only have to update their own yaml(s) with AI and resource stuff if there have been significant changes/additions to these particular parts of the
