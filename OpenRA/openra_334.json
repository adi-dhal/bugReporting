Example of possible colors: \n- http://www.dotnetperls.com/color-table\n- http://msdn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/library/vstudio/system.drawing.color%28v=vs.110%29.aspx\n\nHere are some choices:\n![516979colors](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1732773/1509093/6bebba46-4a32-11e3-9ccd-492cb84cd0c8.png)\n\nBut instead of modifying this line, Mailaender suggested with due the idea of drawing this separator like the rest of the UI to make it skinnable (because, this separator is currently shared with other mods).\n\nI think it's a good idea to add this separator into dialog.png\nAnd btw, it's not even necessary to draw a new separator in dialog.png files since we can reuse one of the button borders.\n\nSince this separator is a 1x19 px rectangle, here is what its chrome.yaml declarations could be:\n\n```\n# Used for vertical separator on drop-down menus\nseparator: dialog.png\n    separator: 512,0,1,19\n```\n\nI've been told that the lines that need to be edited are around line 39:\nhttps://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/fc49950fd417017d9fafac53726cd831f6dd9af6/OpenRA.Game/Widgets/DropDownButtonWidget.cs#L39\n\nBut I am not a developer so.. that's why I am posting this issue.\nEDIT: I will try to work on it but it's a long way...

the [PPM forums](http://www.ppmsite.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=496773):\n\n> the problem is that community voxels use the XYZ scale values inside the voxel to scale it down ingame compared to its base dimensions, for a somewhat 'smoothing' effect, or to make it wider, shorter or whatever without having to redo the voxel. This works absolutely fine in TS and RA2, but OpenRA seems to treat those values as bounds instead, as a result any voxel with scale values lower than its actual dimensions will have parts cut off/shown at the wrong position.\n\nThis seems to contradict the format description from ra2ff.txt, but would certainly explain the issues that we see.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4112","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4112/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4112/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4112/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4112","id":22394379,"number":4112,"title":"Inform
