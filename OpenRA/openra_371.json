The observer-shroud stuff can be used to partition off scene visibility in the map.\n\nUnless (until?) somebody adds multi-tileset support, these would all have to share a tileset, probably temperat.\n\nSome scene ideas:\n- GDI staging base on a peninsula, with Orca & gunboat patrols, units are produced and shipped off via hovercraft (no combat).\n- Nod flame tanks torching a village, with a church next to a tib field. Civilians panic and run into the tib field, where they become viceroids and destroy the nod troops.\n- Nod base with walls, Sam sites, and Obelisks. Ion cannon takes out power, and then mammoth tanks and orca roll in (scene finishes before too much of the base is destroyed).\n- Stealth tanks ambushing a GDI convoy along a forested road.\n- Commando infiltrating a Nod base to free civilians from a prison.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on

first two patches fix the broken pausing interaction with replays and the debug menu. The chat spam on pause/unpause has also been disabled for singleplayer games.\n\nThe final two patches (blocked by the pause fix) make the cheats logic robust against missing widgets and moves the panel to the ingame menu in C&C. The Desync button has been removed from C&C as I consider it unnecessary and unpolished.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2990","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2990/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2990/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2990/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2990","id":12894652,"number":2990,"title":"Set order lag dynamically","user":{"login":"pchote","id":167819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/167819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote","html_url":"https://github.com/pchote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382407,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"02d7e1","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2013-04-07T12:24:00Z","updated_at":"2013-05-16T17:52:26Z","closed_at":"2013-04-20T23:57:01Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Setting every game to 120ms lag is silly, especially for singleplayer.\n\nThis should be simple to fix -
