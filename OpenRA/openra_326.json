Concept\n\nCreate a new class of conditional effects that can be triggered from various sources, such as weapon impacts.\n## Reason\n\nFlexible approach to triggering effects and scripts, usable by weapons, actors, and map triggers.\n(I.e. an effect to damage an actor can be called without needing an attached weapon.)\n## Description\n\nWould function very similar to Warheads.\n\nAn conditional effect can take parameters that define its exact behavior (Ex. Warheads are specified as having damage values, spread, sounds, etc.)\n\nConditional triggers determine if an effect is triggered or not.\n## Possible conditional triggers\n\n'On-hit': When a weapon hits a location\n'On-hit-killing-shot': When a weapon hit results in at least 1 actor death\n'After-Delay': After a delay of specified amount of ms.\n'On-hit-Below-Health': When a weapon hits an actor that has less than specified percentage of health.\n'On-fire': When a weapon is fired.\nEtc.\n## Possible effects\n\nDamageActor: Same function as the damage component of a warhead.\nCreateSFX: Same function as the sound and explosion components of a warhead.\nModifyActor: Modifies an attribute of the target actor. (Such as which user it belongs to, i.e. loyalty changes.)\nCreateObject: Spawns an object (projectile, unit, building, etc.) at the target location.\n## Example of use\n\nA 'face-hugger' weapon has a DamageActor effect for causing damage, a CreateSFX effect for spawning the graphic and sound, a CreateObject and a DestroyObject effect.\n\nThe DamageActor trigger upon 'on-hit' and does damage to the target.\nThe CreateSFX triggers upon 'on-fire' and creates the dust-puff graphic and plays the alien-screech sound.\nThe CreateObject triggers upon a 'on-hit-killing-shot' and spawns a young alien.\nThe DestroyObject triggers upon a 'on-hit-killing-shot' and silently removes the face-hugger from the game.\n\n<bountysource-plugin>\n\n---\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Place a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/1364029-generic-conditional-effects-damageactor-modifyactor-createobject-createsfx-etc?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4363/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4362","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4362/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4362/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4362/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4362","id":24734122,"number":4362,"title":"C&C tooltips for crates aren't showing up","user":{"login":"cjshmyr","id":566742,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/566742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr","html_url":"https://github.com/cjshmyr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382400,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"d7e102","default":false},{"id":33453175,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Tiberian%20Dawn","name":"Tiberian Dawn","color":"FFD700","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"pchote","id":167819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/167819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote","html_url":"https://github.com/pchote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"pchote","id":167819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/167819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote","html_url":"https://github.com/pchote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-12-24T03:58:22Z","updated_at":"2013-12-26T22:23:18Z","closed_at":"2013-12-26T21:55:02Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"I'm not sure what's all affected -

Some features might not be attainable (such as joining a game in-progress) and I may have missed a few, so this is high-level but covers a fair bit of it.\n- [ ] Live game joining (depends on Save/Load serialization of game state)\n- [x] Support SS map format through utility import (works in another branch, requires PR)\n- [ ] Add entries for SS assets to the global mix database (not required, but useful)\n- [x] Always show unit health bars (via #4054)\n- [x] Spawning varying types of crates (via #4360)\n- [x] Allow for individual stat leveling of hero units - armor, damage, movement speed, rate of fire, weapon range - [seen here](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/566742/1804297/3287f418-6c47-11e3-8d99-3aeb4d0ba260.png). This will take some thought because the current experience points system levels up all of these stats equally (via #4383). \n- [x] Introduce new modifiers for rate of fire (via #6079)\n- [x] Introduce new modifiers for weapon range (it's done but not sure when)\n- [x] Crates to level up individual stats. (via #4383)\n- [ ] Art for new crates - potentially use SS' existing crates, but these need to have shadows added to them, and potentially also effects for floating in water (RA mod support). Potentially use the wooden crate, and do a ton of palette remaps to them for varying colors.\n- [ ] New art / interface similar to sole survivor, as a start. Work in progress seen here: [original game image](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/566742/1816923/c58bec2a-6f5c-11e3-8185-92ffce3ba82e.jpg), [1st attempt](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/566742/1816929/717a9518-6f5d-11e3-9fa0-54027af8e74f.png), [2nd attempt (improvement)](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/566742/1816930/7a280e70-6f5d-11e3-9a90-3de074b2ff3f.png)\n- [ ] Logic for specifying custom UI in a map.yaml/map.lua\n- [x] Always showing the player's name above a player's \"hero\" unit (via #4393).\n- [ ] Capture the Flag logic, or other objective based game logic (e.g. deathmatch).\n- [ ] Allow an option to choose which announcer pack to use\n- [ ] Attaching EVA announcer clips to specific events (a certain type of crate was picked up, or an objective was met).\n- [ ] Custom crate behavior mentioned here: http://www.cnc-source.com/?page=content/ss/ssmisc\n- [x] Tooltip changes - only show the unit name on the tooltip, hide country + name. This is currently done for neutral actors, but there should be a flag that can be set in the yaml. #6613\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/1363975-sole-survivor-additional-mod-support?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4361/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4360","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4360/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4360/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4360/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/4360","id":24733018,"number":4360,"title":"CrateSpawner changes","user":{"login":"cjshmyr","id":566742,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/566742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr","html_url":"https://github.com/cjshmyr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2013-12-24T02:54:47Z","updated_at":"2014-06-26T16:19:42Z","closed_at":"2013-12-28T03:11:12Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/4360","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/4360","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/4360.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/4360.patch"},"body":"Changes:\n- Moved all crate spawning logic into CrateSpawner.cs (removed CrateDrop.cs)\n- Added support for varying types of crates to be spawned, and specify the chance each crate can appear\n- Updated RA maps to use CrateSpawner\n\nI created a test map for CNC which is available [here](http://hamb.in/crate-testing.oramap).
