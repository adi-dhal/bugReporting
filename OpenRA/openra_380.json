The idea really appeals to me. I think it should be an option in the game lobby. \n\nI would really like to see something like this implemented. It would be nice if game code allowed you to make factions really easily, and specify them in a map's game rules. Like: \n\n```\nPlayerFaction: allies2\n    FactionName: England\n    UnitsDisable:\n        Units: JEEP, HELI, ARTY, APC\n    AllowUnits: \n        Units: 5TNK, APCW, E8, A10\n```\n\n<bountysource-plugin>\n\n---\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Place a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/116641-allow-easy-creation-management-of-factions?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2733/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2732","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2732/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2732/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2732/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2732","id":11657377,"number":2732,"title":"Use engineers to defuse mines","user":{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":21103452,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Balancing","name":"Balancing","color":"DDDDDD","default":false},{"id":6382407,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"02d7e1","default":false},{"id":21877809,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Red%20Alert","name":"Red Alert","color":"8B0000","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2013-03-05T08:16:12Z","updated_at":"2014-02-22T08:57:52Z","closed_at":"2013-05-10T09:56:41Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Currently there is nothing to counter mines directly other than switching to air units only or iron curtained units against vehicle mines or nuking might help, never tried.

This can be disadvantage if your have a lot of bursts, but only have one shot left. After firing, you then have to wait a long time for the unit to reload again.\n\nProposal: Say you have finished firing but still have unfired bursts remaining. You wait for your ROF time to pass, and then your unit begins to reload, one shot at a time. Example: Say you have Burst:4  and ROF:100. You fire 3 shots, and have one left. Your unit then pauses for 100 ticks. At that point, one burst is reloaded every X ticks, where X is the BurstDelay value (default=5). So the total reload time would be 100 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 115.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/115665-bursts-reload-when-idle?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2729","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2729/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2729/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2729/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/2729","id":11595355,"number":2729,"title":"Dump some more values into the debug log to investigate desyncs","user":{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-03-03T18:43:41Z","updated_at":"2014-06-19T09:12:10Z","closed_at":"2013-03-10T05:10:42Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/2729","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/2729","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/2729.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/2729.patch"},"body":"I want to find out if the inaccuracy calculation from bullets is a source of common desync problems.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2729/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2728","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2728/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2728/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2728/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2728","id":11594702,"number":2728,"title":"DESYNC diff collection for playtest-20130304","user":{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382357,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Crash","name":"Crash","color":"e10c02","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2013-03-03T17:55:50Z","updated_at":"2013-03-11T10:01:49Z","closed_at":"2013-03-11T09:56:30Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Sadly the problem is still not solved.
