getting a match with a lot of players to start, only to find out the game lags as hell is a pain in the ass. Therefore it would be useful to be able to view the latency in relation to the host and/or packet loss per player before and/or during a match.\n\nIn the long term the problems with lag could probably be fixed in the network code, but as a workaround these statistics would be very welcome addition.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on
