`EditorSprite` for the external editor looks for a filename rather than a sequence name, but since sequence names and filenames for blue tiberium don't match, it doesn't show up in the editor. Additionally, even if it did, the editor cannot handle FixedColorPalette, so rtib1.\\* would show up with the default \"GDI\" remap color, rather than blue.\n\nAdding a bti1.shp to the bits folder that uses blue colors from the palette instead of remap fixes both issues.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8052","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8052/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8052/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8052/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8052","id":71597845,"number":8052,"title":"Add Cargo descriptions.","user":{"login":"Phrohdoh","id":4861023,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4861023?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh","html_url":"https://github.com/Phrohdoh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-04-28T14:00:37Z","updated_at":"2015-04-28T20:03:03Z","closed_at":"2015-04-28T19:59:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/8052","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8052","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8052.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8052.patch"},"body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8052/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8051","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8051/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8051/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8051/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8051","id":71477940,"number":8051,"title":"Add HealsPassengers and change UnloadCargo to take an actor reference (or IEnumerable<Actor>).","user":{"login":"Phrohdoh","id":4861023,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4861023?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh","html_url":"https://github.com/Phrohdoh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":117739713,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Changes%20requested","name":"PR: Changes requested","color":"e11d21","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/13","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestone/13","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/13/labels","id":930452,"number":13,"title":"Future","description":"This milestone is meant for stuff we want fixed, but don't have a timeline for yet.

Resources, smudges and buildable terrain benefit from this as they represent large regions that don't change often.\n- The shroud was previously employing some manual vertex caching of its own, but still had to rebuild vertex buffers every frame. It now avoids this costly rebuild by maintaining its own vertex buffers.\n\nThe VertexCache changes reduce CPU time spent in rendering these parts of the terrain from about 6% to 5%.\n\nThe shroud vertex buffers reduce CPU time spent rendering the shroud from about 12% to 3%.\n\nTesting wise, I would recommend checking that shroud, resources, smudges and buildable terrain work as expected across all the mods. You should not notice any changes in the visuals.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8049","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8049/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8049/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8049/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8049","id":71412160,"number":8049,"title":"OpenGL

OK.\n- The RA mission **soviet-01** is a very easy way to test that the Flare actor (which is the only use-case for `RenderFlare` (imagine that)) still looks OK.\n\n**Edit:**\n\n> [15:38] <+pchote> my
