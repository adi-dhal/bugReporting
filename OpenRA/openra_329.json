OpenRA already supports WAV files, as far as I can tell from rummaging through the code there are only two issues to solve (which exceed my abilities right now, unfortunately) to support PCM .wav for music:\n\n1) MusicInfo.cs is currently hardcoded to only look for files with .aud extension.\n\n2) WavLoader does not yet have an equivalent to AudLoader's SoundLength function.\n\nChanging this could serve as both a stop-gap solution for those that want stereo, high-quality in-game music support (I do, for instance), as well as a first step towards supporting more audio formats like OGG and/or IMA ADPCM (RA2) later on.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4265","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4265/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4265/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4265/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/4265","id":23921043,"number":4265,"title":"Fixed
