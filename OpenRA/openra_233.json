I don't know if this is the right place to post this, but I've seen some bugs labeld as \"Feature\" so I'm going ahead. Recently, I've had a few ideas about a touch interface for OpenRA. Lots of cheap touch embeded windows devices have come up, I have one myself (Asus Transformer T100) and I would love to be able to play ORA with only the touchsceen. As it is, it's very hard to play on the touchscreen, it feels clumsy - so after looking over a few RTS games that have touch support, I mocked up some UI pictures. Please have a look and tell me what you think!\n\nFirst one is a basic UI that integrates scrolling buttons that pan the camera. Not very pretty, but functional. It also has grouping buttons that emulate 1-7 on the keyboard as well as the CTRL key.\n\n![openra simple touch interface proposal 1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6204538/5504891/ae5c8286-8792-11e4-81cb-2387bc5c62df.jpg)\n\nThe second one uses a virtual Thumbstick for camera controls. I think this is the most elegant as it takes up less screen real estate - but it's probably the hardest to implement. It also has the grouping buttons.\n\n![openra simple touch interface proposal 2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6204538/5504921/36a2f896-8793-11e4-9f53-1d365c571b94.jpg)\n\nBesides these UI changes, the engine hould also be able to understand multitouch. For example:\n- one finger touch selects a unit, or issues orders (left click)\n- one finger touch and hold drags a selection box\n- two finger touch deselects the units (right click)\n- tree finger hold pans the camera (middle mouse)\n\nWith these changes, the game would be comfortable on any touch device, and could also be ported to android. Please tell me what you think.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on

With the map importer for Dune 2000 maps in the making (#7135), we will need a few more things:\n   **a) add \"missing\" tiles to the `arrakis.yaml` tileset file**\n   While we (_may, but questionably_) have all different tiles referenced in the file and this is good enough for the map editor, the map import does not have everything it needs (terrain-wise), which results in incorrect tiles (nothing deal-breaking, but they have to be then manually replaced via the map editor). I've gone over this in several other tickets and on IRC. (#5875)\n   **b) add House Corrino, Fremen, Smugglers and Mercenaries as non-playable subfactions**\n   This is required for importing missions.\n2. Also I am adding a few voice notifications that we are not, but should be using.\n   a) The code that will use the `EnemyUnitsApproaching` notification is currently being worked on.\n   b) `Guarding` should really be used by the existing Guard command.\n   c) Once the new UI is in place and the upgrades for the production structures are implemented, the `Upgrading` notification should be used. (#6043, #3211)\n3. Please don't bash me for the empty `corrino.yaml`. I will need some advice on what structures does this faction have that are visually different from the other houses to populate it properly.\n4. Added a few more loading screen messages :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7147/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7146","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7146/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7146/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7146/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7146","id":52354738,"number":7146,"title":"D2k - Added more Rifle Inf. to Starting Units.","user":{"login":"MustaphaTR","id":7933210,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7933210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR","html_url":"https://github.com/MustaphaTR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-12-18T11:44:37Z","updated_at":"2014-12-19T12:40:38Z","closed_at":"2014-12-18T19:42:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/7146","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7146","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7146.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7146.patch"},"body":"There was less Light Infantry than RA and CnC mod.

the original TD/RA1/D2k infantry returned to their standing or prone stances between each shot while in OpenRA they freeze on the last fire frame. IMO it'd look a lot better if they returned to their standing/prone frames just like the original games.\n\nIt'd fix the issue where infantry stay in their fire frames after shooting but are actually turning around or doing some other action.\n\nIt would also fix the following issue in D2k: D2k infantry's last fire frames have muzzle flashes which means they 'freeze mid shot' and it all looks rather silly. The other alternative to fix this would be to loop back to the first fire frame for D2k but I think the above change would be generally better.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue?
