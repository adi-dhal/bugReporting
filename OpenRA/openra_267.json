This usually results in them driving far from the local ore refinery, when there may be a closer, safer supply of ore. I've had a look at FindResources and it pretty much needs a re-write.\n\nCurrently it only accounts for the ore trucks last location while collecting ore. I want to propose three new features, of course with the original logic heuristics : Select the closest resource cell based on \n1) Distance from local refinery\n2) Amount of ore in the location\n3) likeliness of attack\n\nTo do this I wanted to run this methodology passed you guys before commencing work on it.\n\n1) Apply split and merge to section areas of ore. Stop decomposing at some area covered by the ore. (Unsupervised classification like mean-shift may be better but probably slower)\n2) Update each cluster with the ore positions, and number of enemies in the cluster\n3) Compute the distance between the local refinery to each centroid.\n4) Find the safest and most valuable clusters using these three parameters.\n5) Bypass this system if the user clicks on a ore location - Treat the clicked ore location as the local refinery CPos.\n6) Once the cluster is selected, the harvester will collect the resource closest to either the last users click or the refinery, not the last position of the truck.\n\nIt is probably faster to partition the scene on initialisation and enable/disable resource cells as they are collected/spawn.\n\nLuke\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6137/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6136","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6136/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6136/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6136/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/6136","id":39346464,"number":6136,"title":"Infiltration
