You can see this best at the Atreides Hightech Factory roof: http://imgur.com/c23cI\n\nThe last palette index (255 when started counting at 0) mapped to transparency might be a wanted feature for RA palettes. At least XCC Mixer shows a white spot at the last index which has the RGB code 63 63 63 (should be grey).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2342","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2342/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2342/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2342/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2342","id":5892706,"number":2342,"title":"[d2k]
