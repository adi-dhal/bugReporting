are back with our campaign menu, but since we changed a lot of things, we decided to open a new pull request.\nThe original PR can be found here(https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7559).\nHere are the changes/additions from the last PR:\n- Faction selection\n  - the .vqa files are not mandatory anymore and we can remove them, if that is preferred\n  - a custom recreation of the transmission-select screen if no vqa is found\n- alternative mission selection (Campaign-Preview, i.e. a-,b-,c-missions)\n  - the mission following a victory is declared in the yaml of the map (“Next Mission”), which allows for branching campaign-paths\n  - If no preview-picture is available the faction logo appears\n- Generalization, so it should work for all mods\n  - currently active in the cnc and ra mods\n- Other requests\n  - use MapCache instead of manual preview\n  - implement SaveProgressFlag\n  - used OnPlayerWon Event to save the campaign progress\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9289/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9288","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9288/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9288/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9288/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9288","id":105102932,"number":9288,"title":"Fix

possible, relatively simple approach would be to compare the projectile facing right before explosion with the facing of directly hit actors (explosion happened inside their health radius / hit box / whatever).\r\n\r\nIf the projectile facing exactly matched or diverted by no more than X degrees, it must have hit the weak rear armor, giving a damage bonus.\r\nIf the facing was the opposite, it must have hit the front, reducing the damage.\r\nIn between it must have hit the sides, so apply normal damage.\r\n\r\nThis is just a possibility.
