After rearming it continues the attack move starting from the airfield. This happens once and after that it comes back to base and just circles above construction yard and doesn't rearm or go to the attack move location.\n\nHelicopters have a different behaviour. After they attack the target and run out of ammo, they come back to helipad, rearm and continue the attack move. If they encounter another target (or the same target), they attack it and come back to helipad for the second time. But instead of landing and rearming, they immediately skip to the attack move once they arrive at helipad. Since they carry out the attack move without ammo they come back to helipad at first enemy encounter and this repeats as a loop. \n\nAircraft attack move works if a second airfield/helipad is built. After that it does this rearming and attack moving action until no target remains along the path and it arrives at attack move location.\n\nI think the reason is that the airfield/helipad is reserved for some reason after the first rearming and the aircraft can't land. It is also not possible to give a manual landing order. When a second airfield/helipad is built it works.\n\nThis happens in latest release and playtest.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/8596577-aircraft-attack-move-issues?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7481/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7480","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7480/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7480/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7480/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7480","id":57734066,"number":7480,"title":"Desaturate beacon posters in TD menu.","user":{"login":"pchote","id":167819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/167819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote","html_url":"https://github.com/pchote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-02-15T15:37:03Z","updated_at":"2015-03-21T15:04:11Z","closed_at":"2015-02-16T21:06:28Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/7480","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7480","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7480.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7480.patch"},"body":"Fixes #7395.

pr can be divided into three parts:\n1. Fix the propagation of `RaceInit` between producer &rarr; producee (which only works in about half of the required cases on current bleed).\n2. Add support for race-specific sprite sequences (this can eventually be switched out for a more generic implementation using upgrades).\n3. Merge the duplicated D2K actors, and reorganize the definitions to be more consistent with the other mods.\n\nThis significantly simplifies the D2K mod rules, and should make it easier to deal with in the future as we work through reimplementing the original tech tree and balance.  It also fixes a bunch of inconsistencies that have grown in the rules over the years (mismatched actor name cases, redundant prerequisites defined on only some actors, duplicated traits on inherited actors, etc).\n\nThe main change gameplay-wise is that you must now capture (or build in debug-mode) an enemy construction yard and make it primary (mouseover and deploy) in order to produce a different faction's structures.  The build icons in the sidebar show what faction's structures you are building. The same applies for building faction-specific MCVs (they inherit the race of the factory that build them).  The race of actors placed in the map editor can be set using the Race: initializer, otherwise it will be determined based on the owner.  The ingame map editor will eventually be able to set this (together with other properties such as the facing, owner, health) in an actor-properties panel.\n\nFixes #3699, #7274.  Closes #7452.\n\nThis is a monster of a PR, so my apologies to the people reviewing this.  @penev92 has helped me test this over the last week, and I think we've identified and fixed most of the regressions.  I expect there may be a few we've missed, however.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7476","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7476/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7476/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7476/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7476","id":57711702,"number":7476,"title":"Allow
