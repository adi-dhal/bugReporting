Adds 2 interfaces: `INotifyExitCargo` and `INotifyEnterCargo` (used in Passenger)\n- Adds interface `IResolvePredefinedUpgrades` (could possibly be reflected for docs), does not enforce a dictionary or any other specific implementation\n- Passenger now handles upgrades for Cargo\n- The commit message explains the test changes present which will of course be removed before merging\n\nI'm sure this has quite a ways to go but I'd rather open this PR than let the feature rot.\n\n**Help Wanted:**\nI would like to match the `[name]`, `[weight]`, `[type]`, etc values via Regex which will allow strings such as `passenger.[name].[weight]` → `passenger.e1.1`.\nCurrently there can only be one replacement in each string as I iterate over the available substitutions in a poor manner.\n_Note:_ I use dot notation as a preference, it is not enforced.\n`passenger.e1 -- weight(1)` is viable if something grants `passenger.[name] -- weight([weight])`\n\n**Ingame Testing:** _Tiberian Sun_\nGDI's `GAVULC` is a `Cargo` actor with a `MaxWeight` of 2, so go ahead and throw some **infantry** in there.\n\n``` yaml\nGAVULC:\n    Cargo:\n        Types: Infantry\n        PipCount: 2\n        MaxWeight: 2\n    Armament@PRIMARY:\n        Weapon: VulcanTower\n        RestrictedByUpgrade: passenger.Infantry\n    Armament@WEIGHT:\n        Weapon: EMPulseCannon\n        RequiresUpgrade: passenger.weight.2 #Testing: Umagon's weight is 2\n    Armament@E3:\n        Weapon: SAMTower\n        RequiresUpgrade: passenger.e3\n\n^Infantry:\n    Passenger:\n        GrantUpgrades: passenger.[type], passenger.[name], passenger.weight.[weight]\n```\n\n**Technical Notes:**\nThe Passenger impl uses a a simple `Dictionary<string, string>` for the time being, so every substitution must become a string somehow.

sorry if I'm saying this, and I'm perfectly aware how to counter artillery with Soviets, blind them by shooting their helicopter spotter / sniffing out their phase transports.\n\nBut then, it always end up in a race against time in 1 vs 1 situation, you got to defeat or at least severely cripple your Allied enemy BEFORE your enemy turn on their GPS, and because longbows can attack air, using yaks/migs to micro-kill artilleries is negated late game, making an essentially stalemated endgame very difficult to win unless you prepare a nuke silo first.... because after GPS kicked in, all your enemy needs to do is spam artillery with longbow guards and use their range advantage to basecreep toward your base.\n\nWell, the very obvious solution, but a rather unnerving one (if historically used by Soviet Union, may I add) is throw cannon fodders at them, a lot of riflemen with few heavy tanks and rocket soldiers to distract them, preferably somewhere else, but still, there is a single thing named Tanya that could practically mow down whole group of infantry by themselves. And GPS causing them to not diverting their artilleries because they knew it is mostly infantry and just sent tanya with rocket soldiers and medics.\n\nAnd even mammoth tanks is hard to go there, because when their riflemen / rocket soldiers screen are depleted by long range artilleries, they themselves end up sitting ducks against enemy rocket soldiers.\n\nBefore GPS kicking in, even with their less range, properly microed V2 (with some lucks because it's blind firing / supported by expendable Yaks as well) can somehow deter them from attacking, but with GPS, artilleries did not need any \"spotters\" again, and they can reign free with their 14 range of attack.\n\nSo may I suggest some balance workaround to lessen the Allied late-game advantage? Only one of these is needed though IMHO.\n\n1) Either reduce artillery range to 10 (the same as V2) or increase V2 range to 14 (increase their price if needed too) - level up their range playing field, just like Cruisers and Missile Subs have equal 16 range\n\n2) Turn off Tanya's auto-target (so she should end up like how she behave originally), making a big infantry distraction more viable tactics - forcing the allied to sacrifice concentrated artillery barrage for taking care of infantry horde at the other \"front\"\n\n3) Either give Mig Air-to-Air capability, or turn off Longbow's air-to-air capability, so air power against artillery is still a viable tactic late game. - So guarding artilleries with longbows is now less viable option.\n\n4) Either remove Allied GPS, or give Gap Generators to Soviets - I'm not sure on this one, but with fog of war on, Soviets are still practically blind late game, either blind the Allies or give Soviets way to blind the GPS.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n<bountysource-plugin>\n\n---\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Place a bounty on

I don't think it's a hardware problem as I have a relatively high end system build (Intel Core i7-4578 Haswell, 16GB RAM, SSD).\n\nDo you guys have any idea what could be the cause of this?
