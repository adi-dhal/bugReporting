If you have a ton of buildings, especially base defenses, it can be extremely difficult to click on all of them one by one. I have lost games because I couldn't click directly on the correct base defense in time.\r\n\r\nIt can be particularly troublesome to try and click on a base defense to repair it, and click repair on a unit by mistake and have them suddenly missing from combat as they return to the repair facility.\r\n\r\nIf you have the money, and wish to do so, why not press a button and have all buildings repair? Seems like something to make sense having in the game.\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13805","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13805/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13805/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13805/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13805","id":248891906,"number":13805,"title":"Helicopters cannot be repaired in C&C","user":{"login":"kerryhall","id":17752714,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/17752714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerryhall","html_url":"https://github.com/kerryhall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerryhall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerryhall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerryhall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerryhall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerryhall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerryhall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerryhall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerryhall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerryhall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-08-09T01:29:49Z","updated_at":"2017-08-09T07:52:21Z","closed_at":"2017-08-09T07:52:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Running version release-20170527.\r\n\r\nReproduce by trying to send a helicopter to the repair facility in C&C.
