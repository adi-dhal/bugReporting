On bigger maps, you have to wait a long time. The time depends also on which direction the planes come from, so it's highly variable. Given that players now receive a warning for airstrikes, I think it makes sense to have a standardized time delay (somewhere between 4-8 seconds).\n\nIf people don't like the idea of \"planes spawning in the middle of the map\", perhaps they could be made to look like they just descended from a higher altitude, and now are coming into view. \n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue?
