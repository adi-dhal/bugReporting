pathfinder algorithm was hard to understand and the PathFinder class violated heavily the Single Responsibility principle and the Open-Closed principle. So I refactored it using the Decorator pattern design so classes can focus on a single operation (caching, calculations, logging (on the way)) while being easily and isolately expandable instead of having one bloated and hard-to-reuse-and-extent class.\n\nI also modified the cachedpaths variable to use a Dictionary instead of a list, as order is not important in this case and insertions, deletions and lookups on a dictionary have cost O(1).\n\nThe Expand operation in PathSearch also was hard to understand, follow and unit test, so I've reorganized the responsibilities and extracted methods in an intent to make things easier to understand.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7357","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7357/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7357/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7357/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7357","id":54707919,"number":7357,"title":"Fix
