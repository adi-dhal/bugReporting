The trade-off is that it takes (significantly) longer to generate the previews in the map chooser.

new properties to improve it's versatility.\n\nCloneAmount: Integer\nHow many units to clone. Basically, if a unit is produced then clone it more than just once. So, if it's 100 then the unit gets cloned 100 times.\n\nSameFacility: Boolean\nWhether or not the cloning is restricted to the same structure the Production ability is on. Basically, if a unit is produced from a Barracks and that Barracks has the ClonesProducedUnits trait, it will only clone the unit at this very same Barracks instead of all of the Barracks on the map that would also have the ClonesProducedUnits trait.\n\nEDIT: Here's some more ideas.\n\nFor the Clonable trait, have a CloneCount or something. If CloneCount is less than the CloneAmount from a cloning facility, then only the amount stated in CloneCount will be cloned. If it's more, it will not go higher than CloneAmount. With this, you can make \"Hero\" units completely not clonable.\n\nAlso would give more control over the amount of units cloned and devalue making more cloning facilities or even make massing cloning facilities strong with units that can be mass cloned and weak with units that cannot.\n\nMaybe some kind of scaling to cloned units would be interesting, too. So the cloned units could be weaker, or even stronger. I would guess making Clonable able to grant an upgrade to the cloned unit could do this.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on
