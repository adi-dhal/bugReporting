Scatter() is used in scripts to clear actors from a position. Unfortunately, the underlying Nudge() function does not quite insist on choosing a cell that is not the one where the unit is right now as the destination for the move. As a result, there is always a chance that an actor that was ordered to Scatter() stays where he is, which is probably not what was intended.\n\n@pchote thinks it would be \"easy\" to add this. Me, i don't understand the relevant piece of code well enough to tell if that's the case.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9484/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9483","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9483/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9483/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9483/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9483","id":108942526,"number":9483,"title":"Clean

alternative method to the other tutorials - https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Creation%20of%20a%20new%20unit%20for%20OpenRA%20(step%20by%20step) and https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Converting-a-3D-infantry-model-to-sprites\n\nI'm using three programs - 3dsMax 9, Bulk Rename Utility (http://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/Download.php) and SHP Builder (http://www.ppmsite.com/?go=shpbuilderinfo)\n\n**3dsMax**: we make a model with a shadow plane and sunlight, eventually also spotlights from opposite sides, if some faces get too dark;\n- for a usual tank, I'm using 32 cameras placed in a circle above the model clockwise; 63° from the infantry/sprite tutorial is a good angle (an example here - https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5zJIBBQb3EhQnhjczM0U0Zublk/view?usp=sharing)\n- if you're not using TS-like voxel barrels, it's good to make them somewhat larger; they tend to lose pixels in conversion\n\n**3dsMax rendering**: first, as the tutorials mention, you need to turn off anti-aliasing, namely under the Rendering/Render Scene/Renderer and Customize/Preferences/Rendering\n- under Render Scene/Common Parameters I'm setting only the Output Size 420x420\n- the actual rendering is made by the Rendering/Batch Render function: here we Add 32 entries (or as many cameras you made) and for every one we set an output file (for the sake of simplicity, the example uses from 1 to 32.png; 24bit RGB)\n- if you're rendering an animated model, you have to set the output Range under Render Scene\n- clicking Batch Render button then creates you 32 .png's\n- it takes time, but a file with a preset Batch Render can be used as a template for other models\n- if the unit has a turret, do two renders: one for the chassis, the other for the turret; just make sure you don't overwrite the first output\n\n**Bulk Rename Utility**: let's open the program and drag and drop all the .png's we've made inside, sorting them by name\n- under Remove we can chose the digits 0123456789; under Add/Prefix we choose the unit name; finally under Numbering we create a Suffix, starting at 0, Incr. 1, Pad 4 (important for SHP builder)\n- then we select all the files and Rename\n\n![bru](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13980246/10158028/6c2bcb9c-668f-11e5-8325-0af638955690.png)\n\n**SHP Builder**: now we can make a single .shp file from the output pictures; open the program, choose File/Import and select the first frame (name0000.png)\n- select the optimization; under Frame Size choose the desired frame size (e.g. infantry 50x39, mammoth tank 48x48), under Extra Settings choose Auto select background by pixel 0,0; then, click ok\n- use the fifth tool icon Replace Color to select the correct colors for team and shadow; beware the dark shades receiving the background color (0 in RA palette)\n- now we save it as SHP(TS) and put to our mod/bits\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9481/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9480","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9480/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9480/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9480/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9480","id":108792066,"number":9480,"title":"TFD
