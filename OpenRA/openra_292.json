maps change from time to time, and getting the right version is tricky, adding the map itself to the replay would be very useful. It would also simplify giving a replay to someone else to watch, since it would only require 1 file instead of the replay and the map. It also prevents the situation where a replay is unwatchable because no one can find the right version of the map played on. (This could be an issue recently, e.g. in TD all the maps are being modified by a script to keep up with a change in how tiberium trees are handled). This is also significant in balance testing, where map yaml changes frequently to adapt to test new balance settings. \n\nUsually maps are small while replays are comparatively large, so this shouldn't add a big problem for file sizes. However, I realize this might cause a problem when people use very large maps with custom graphics, units, etc. so maybe the program could opt to not include the map in the replay if it exceeds a certain file size. \n\n<bountysource-plugin>\n\n---\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Place a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/2241235-replay-meta-include-map?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5371/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5370","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5370/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5370/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5370/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5370","id":33840774,"number":5370,"title":"Possible fix for lua crash #5269","user":{"login":"pavlos256","id":311595,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/311595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlos256","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlos256","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlos256/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlos256/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlos256/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlos256/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlos256/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlos256/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlos256/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlos256/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlos256/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-05-19T21:46:45Z","updated_at":"2014-06-16T07:23:42Z","closed_at":"2014-05-20T00:38:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/5370","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5370","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5370.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5370.patch"},"body":"The changes here fix some disposing issues but this crash is very hard to reproduce so I can't really tell if it has been fixed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5370/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5369","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5369/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5369/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5369/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5369","id":33832009,"number":5369,"title":"Yaml undercase rules problems","user":{"login":"Unit158","id":706008,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/706008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158","html_url":"https://github.com/Unit158","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382357,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Crash","name":"Crash","color":"e10c02","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2014-05-19T20:07:41Z","updated_at":"2014-05-19T22:50:43Z","closed_at":"2014-05-19T22:50:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If I name an actor like so:\n\nTURTLE,\n\nand I reference from a transforms trait like so:\n\nTransforms:\n    IntoActor: TURTLE\n    Offset: 0,0\n    Facing: 0\n    TransformSounds: constru2.aud, hvydoor1.aud\n\nthe game should not crash, however, it does.
