tick down to 0 as the game starts).\r\n- Fixed the explosions of the civilian buildings. They spawned infantry (which looked weird) and all other civilian buildings on the map had wrong explosions.\r\n- On that note: The mod rules let Oil Pumps spawn infantry as well (in addition to the

This PR ~~makes WithAttackAnimation be aware of who actually attacks and changes the correct sprite~~ adds a new trait to allow turrets to have an attack sequence.\r\n\r\n![withturretedattackanimation](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1322277/24838691/6284ff16-1d4d-11e7-9e7d-18a6db26e55d.gif)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13065/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13064","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13064/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13064/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13064/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13064","id":219384473,"number":13064,"title":"Disable ToolTip while using support powers #12853","user":{"login":"rob-v","id":16348750,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/16348750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v","html_url":"https://github.com/rob-v","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2017-04-04T21:09:00Z","updated_at":"2017-06-05T16:45:12Z","closed_at":"2017-06-05T16:45:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/13064","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13064","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13064.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13064.patch"},"body":"I didn't find an explicit way how to identify we are using support power.

This PR uses pseudo-property conditions to utilize the condition linter and organize multiple attributes of a trait with a common prefix identifying the trait without making the modder name a condition for each integer/Boolean value shared. As an example, this PR replaces `TimedConditonBar` with `ConditionBar` and exposes the timers of a few traits to demonstrate. `ConditionBar` also shows using `ConditionExpression`s as dynamic field values, which I would like to apply to `TurnSpeed`, `Speed`, `Power`, etc.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Future Direction:\r\nThe reason I had #12925 expose health was to do this: `Power: 200 * health / health.max`, replacing `ScalePowerWithHealth` and making it possible to apply the same thing to values of fields in other traits. Being able to set `Speed` and `TurnSpeed` in `Mobile` separately as `ConditionExpression`s would allow for deploying infantry to turn without being able to move (`Speed: speed-value * !deployed`) without adding custom logic such as a `MovementSpeedMultiplier` and maybe a `TurnSpeedMultiplier`.\r\n\r\nUsing `enum`s to select exposed properties allow for exposing a range of values without a lot of MiniYaml. For example, expressions like `health.damage >= DamageStates.heavy` are fairly clear, and can be given its own name using `GrantCondition`.\r\n```yaml\r\n\tHealth:\r\n\t\tCondition: health\r\n\t\tConditionProperties: damage #, max\r\n\t\tConditionDamageStateConstants: critical # all under DamageStates condition\r\n\tGrantCondition@CRITICAL:\r\n\t\tRequiresCondition: health.damage >= DamageStates.critical\r\n\t\tCondition: criticalspeed\r\n\t\tGrantPermanently: true # NOTE: must be added to GrantCondition\r\n...\r\n\r\n       \r\n\tHealth:\r\n\t\tCondition:

feature I have seen on other RTS games that resemble OpenRA (e.g., Outlive) is an espionage building which users can use (for a charge and these capabilities may take some time for them to come into

buildings (rendering them unusuable for several seconds), redirect/neutralize atomic bombs, view a small segment of area presently under the fog-of-war, *etc.* Not sure if anyone is interested in

do enjoy OpenRA, mostly because it's the closest open-source alternative I've found to [Outlive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlive), a proprietary futuristic RTS game from 2001. One thing I would like to suggest, however, is that you add difficulty modes (e.g., easy, medium, difficult) for how difficult single player games are. So that those of us that are poorer at strategy games can learn the ropes without getting totally annihilated by the opposing team (played by the computer). Likewise those of us that have found the existing game difficulty too easy can still get ourselves a challenge by the most difficult mode. \r\n\r\nThanks for your time,\r\nBrenton","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13043/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13042","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13042/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13042/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13042/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13042","id":218629219,"number":13042,"title":"TD Artillery/MRLS Vision.","user":{"login":"AoAGeneral","id":7693928,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7693928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral","html_url":"https://github.com/AoAGeneral","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":203838214,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20For%20stable","name":"PR: For stable","color":"733799","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/19","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestone/19","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/19/labels","id":1982640,"number":19,"title":"release-20170421","description":"","creator":{"login":"obrakmann","id":4331210,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4331210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann","html_url":"https://github.com/obrakmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":142,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-09-04T20:20:01Z","updated_at":"2017-04-25T09:11:55Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2017-04-25T09:11:39Z"},"comments":7,"created_at":"2017-03-31T22:08:26Z","updated_at":"2017-04-02T20:03:20Z","closed_at":"2017-04-02T20:01:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/13042","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13042","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13042.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13042.patch"},"body":"This is changing the vision of Artillery and MRLS from 8c0 to 5c0.\r\n\r\nThe reason behind this is because we have scouting artillery and MRLS units that have a much larger vision range then infantry and the same vision as hummers and buggies. This turns into games where people build infantry and artillery/MRLS armies and march of death to the enemy. Its more counterable in 1v1 and 2v2 but team games of 3v3+ it becomes incredibly spammy of these units and hard to stop.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=82&p=301205#301205\r\n\r\nI was told about a hit scan range issue that is in RA but I haven't found it. The only case of this is the units will fire once scouted and when the scouting unit dies they continue to fire. However, if you do attack move again or the unit that it is firing at dies then it needs to scout again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13042/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13041","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13041/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13041/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13041/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13041","id":218514800,"number":13041,"title":"Add Juggernaut to TS","user":{"login":"reaperrr","id":2857877,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2857877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperrr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":17,"created_at":"2017-03-31T14:14:05Z","updated_at":"2017-07-23T07:58:40Z","closed_at":"2017-05-14T12:41:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/13041","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13041","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13041.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13041.patch"},"body":"Collateral changes:\r\n- added `StartBurstReport` support to weapons, because otherwise you'd hear 9(!) shots when the Jugger fires since the soundfile itself is already a triple-shot sound (and yes, this was a bug/design error in original TS/FS)\r\n- added Name field to `WithSpriteBody` to allow assigning modifying traits to specific sprite bodies\r\n- made `WithMoveAnimation` compatible with multiple sprite bodies per actor (to avoid using the `WithInfantryBody` hack for the Juggernaut)\r\n- made `GrantConditionOnDeploy` compatible with multiple sprite bodies per actor and `WithMakeAnimation` work for deploying actors","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13041/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4964","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"CED5:572C:15C5143:2B3F2D6:59D6B2B7","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=37>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=405>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=35>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"c7a063c869dfae205fa5f5b672f245a2\"","status":"200 OK"}}
