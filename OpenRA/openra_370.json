Game just stopped. \n\nSome ideas: \n- time expiration (mines disappear after x seconds)\n- force attack should work against mines to clear mine field\n- slower laying (MUCH SLOWER!)\n- mines should cost credits\n- sth to disable them, but fast. (cause if you put artie behind them you dont have time to disable)\n- chain reaction if explode (like 5 mines near the exploding mine explode, too)\n- a limit to how many mines each player can make\n- or just like in original RA: every mine needs to be layed manually (non automatic)\n\nI suggest deleting mine layer from game until fixed. Very few ppl use it anyways and its very annoying. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3039","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3039/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3039/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3039/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3039","id":13092072,"number":3039,"title":"sequences error not that helpful","user":{"login":"psydev","id":1637812,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1637812?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev","html_url":"https://github.com/psydev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33149887,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Polish","name":"Polish","color":"FF9933","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-04-11T22:01:48Z","updated_at":"2013-04-23T05:17:47Z","closed_at":"2013-04-22T23:00:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In my modding, I've been somewhat often getting the error,\n\n```\nException of type `System.InvalidOperationException`: Unit `ftnk` does not have any sequences defined.\n```\n\nThe problem is that it's not accurate.

the same shroud sprite along the edges of the (explored) map looks almost as bad as a hard edge.

the N/E/S/W tiles and select them deterministically to keep a static border but break the repetitiveness of the hard map edges.\n- The awesome way would be to make variants of all the tiles, and then pick them randomly each frame to animate the
