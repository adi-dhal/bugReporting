The spikes get worse with more AI.\n## Cause\n\nAIs re-evaluate their current state at set intervals. For example [assigning of roles](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/7d56209f3b772ea847cc8c9decb4c33cc4210e7d/OpenRA.Mods.Common/AI/HackyAI.cs#L40-L41) and [updating of squads](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/7d56209f3b772ea847cc8c9decb4c33cc4210e7d/OpenRA.Mods.Common/AI/HackyAI.cs#L46-L47). You'll notice both of these are 20/30 ticks - which are both roughly 1 second.\n\nLuckily, evaluating AI state is fast.\n\nWhat happens then is that the AIs issue new orders to be carried out. In a typical case they might issue say 10 orders to one of the squads to attack.\n\nLuckily, issuing orders is fast.\n\n[These orders are processed during the tick by the order manager](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/7d56209f3b772ea847cc8c9decb4c33cc4210e7d/OpenRA.Game/Network/OrderManager.cs#L212).\n\nLuckily, processing orders is fast.\n\n[Each time an order is processed, a hash of the world state must be generated for sync purposes](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/7d56209f3b772ea847cc8c9decb4c33cc4210e7d/OpenRA.Game/Network/OrderManager.cs#L213). This allows clients to identify the order responsible in the event of a desync.\n\nUnluckily, hashing the world state is extremely slow.\n\nIn games with several AI, a few AI will decide to send orders to their squads, each squad needing maybe a dozen orders. They do this all at the exact same tick. This results in a flood of orders (say about 50 orders instead of the more usual 0-5) to be processed in a single tick. Hashing the world state so many times as a result of processing the orders is the reason for the lag spike.\n## The Fix\n\nI address this issue by limiting the ability of the AI to generate a flood of orders in a single tick. Instead, I spread out the orders over several ticks.\n\nThe first commit makes each AI in the game operate on different ticks. In games with lots of AI, this prevents them teaming up to make one tick very slow.\n\nThe second limits the number of orders an AI can issue per tick. Extra orders are queued up and processed on subsequent ticks. This prevents spikes from issuing orders to entire squads at once by forcing the AI to order each unit on separate ticks.\n\nThis throttling means that orders might be outdated by the time they are issued. This seems to work in my testing but somebody who knows how orders work better than I do should confirm I'm not introducing a massive chance for crashes and/or desyncs.\n## Results\n\nPerf graphs before and after (we care about the teal line representing tick_time)\n\n![Perf Graph Comparion](http://i.imgur.com/SU5a0Lo.png)\n\nYou can check this yourself by just spectating a game with a large number of AI. Wait a few minutes until they start attacking each other and the lag spikes should appear. With this PR they should be prevented.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8770/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8769","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8769/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8769/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8769/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8769","id":97147933,"number":8769,"title":"Remove ESC hotkey from lobby 'Back' button","user":{"login":"obrakmann","id":4331210,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4331210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann","html_url":"https://github.com/obrakmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-07-24T21:10:21Z","updated_at":"2015-07-25T22:54:07Z","closed_at":"2015-07-25T09:12:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/8769","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8769","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8769.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8769.patch"},"body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8769/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8768","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8768/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8768/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8768/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8768","id":97125239,"number":8768,"title":"Some work on Attack*","user":{"login":"matija-hustic","id":5747153,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5747153?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic","html_url":"https://github.com/matija-hustic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":25,"created_at":"2015-07-24T19:28:01Z","updated_at":"2015-10-11T19:31:44Z","closed_at":"2015-10-08T19:56:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/8768","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8768","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8768.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8768.patch"},"body":"Some rewiring (not a full refactor) in the attacking mechanism to accommodate using different cursors and voices with different armaments, as well as combining beneficial (buffs) and damaging weapons for a single actor.\n\nEliminates the need for the medic to subclass `AttackFrontal` and `AutoHeal` or use `Heal`.\n\nI'll type up the upgrade rule after review of other code.\n\nDiscussed to some extent in #8763.

improves 3 things:\n\n**1. The low power check.** \nPreviously, it would check whether players' `ExcessPower` was less than `MinimumExcessPower` or whether the sum of all `Power` traits on the structure it wanted to build _exceeded_ the players' `ExcessPower`, and if either was true, build a power plant instead.\nThe catch: power _draw_ is represented by _negative_ numbers, so the only structures that would trigger the 2nd check were - power plants.\nIn other words, as long as current `ExcessPower` was equal or higher than `MinimumExcessPower`, the whole check would effectively fail, hence why the AI was out of power about half the time before I introduced `MinimumExcessPower` recently.\nNow the 2nd check properly evaluates whether current `ExcessPower` + to-build actors' `Power` would be _lower_ than `MinimumExcessPower`, and in that case build a power plant instead.\nAdditionally, unlike before, it now also performs the \"do I have enough power\" check for the higher-priority overrides (refineries, production buildings, silos).\nLast but not least, it now also gives powerplants priority if already on low power (no idea why it was different before).\n\n**2. Repeated placement failures.**\nPreviously, the AI would constantly and stubbornly retry to build and place a structure even if out of space.\nNow, after 3 consecutive failed attempts to place a structure, it is assumed that the AI has run out of build space and further production of structures is paused for a minute (default value of `StructureProductionResumeDelay`) and only resumed if the number of buildings decreased (or number of construction yards increased) in the meantime.\n\n**3. Placement failure of naval structures.**\nPreviously, the AI would try to build naval structures even if there was no water within the buildable area. Now it first checks whether there is enough water in the base perimeter, and disables production of naval buildings if not. \nIf there is actually such water space, when deciding whether to build a naval structure it checks if a building providing buildable area is close enough to that water. Only if that condition is met as well, the naval structure will be produced.\n\nIn summary, this should considerably reduce lag spikes from repeated building placement failures (particularly if it runs out of space) and finally prevent the AI reliably from driving itself into low power.\n\nFixes #8116, mostly adresses #4717.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8759/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8758","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8758/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8758/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8758/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8758","id":96122803,"number":8758,"title":"Support
