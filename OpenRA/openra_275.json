I started manually reproducing maps for D2k in ORA format, and noticed that even in the first map there's some major things missing.

This is also the bottom-most concrete tile, but I forgot to highlight that one, too.\n\n5 - Essentially the same issue as 4, but this time it's the corner where the northwest is rock and all other corners are sand. I've checked and the two other corners of this type are usable, and all four corners with three corners rock and one corner sand show up fine as well, so it's just these two one-tile corners that are missing.\n\nUnlabelled - For the other two unlabelled concrete tiles, there's a 1-square rock graphic with an odd smudge that goes here, but I suspect it's somewhere in a larger formation in the map editor and I haven't found it to cut it up.\n\nEverything but (3) should definitely be fixed for multiplayer maps anyway, so even if an import is worked out for D2k missions, the other \"missing tiles\" will still need resolving.\n\nFor comparison, here's what it should look like completed, including units and structures:\n\n![a1v1 complete](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3319884/3503397/22d6a086-0630-11e4-92bf-4291c6d99e6d.png)\n\n<bountysource-plugin>\n\n---\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Place a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/3008891-missing-map-editor-tiles-for-d2k-missions?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5875/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5874","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5874/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5874/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5874/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5874","id":37319187,"number":5874,"title":"Revert TickRender and PauseState changes","user":{"login":"pchote","id":167819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/167819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote","html_url":"https://github.com/pchote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2014-07-07T23:11:13Z","updated_at":"2014-07-19T03:26:09Z","closed_at":"2014-07-08T19:21:49Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/5874","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5874","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5874.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5874.patch"},"body":"This backs out the desync-introducing changes so that we can ship a stable release.
