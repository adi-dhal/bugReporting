some players choose colors close to terrain's (on temperal maps, dark green, dark blue, ... or even manage to get black with some color trick), it is very hard to see their GPS symbols under the FoW. \r\n\r\nSo it can become much easier to sneak attack, which is almost impossible for players who use colors with contrast to terrain.\r\n\r\nNot sure what the solution could be. \r\n- Maybe an equivalent of #9801, but changing the whole color of the enemy team (GPS symbols + maybe units themselves). Not happy with this solution though.\r\n- And further limiting colors might not be an option (#10217)\r\n- Or maybe a white outline on the symbols ?
