we sandbox dangerous lua functions using a lua sandboxing script. This causes issues when you get an error between the Lua binding and CLR, where it shows the line that errored as being a line in the sandbox script. This also causes issues if a programmer would like to use a safe function or table by completely removing the ability to access certain tables. (!)\n\nWith Eluant, we should be able to completely disable dangerous code evaluation in the implementation of Lua by:\nDisabling bytecode or, if that is not possible, removing eval.\nRemoving potentially dangerous functions/modules.\n\nThis will improve our errors and decrease the overhead in executing lua scripts.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on
