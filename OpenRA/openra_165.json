by #9181, this makes `FieldLoader` capable of loading `Dictionary<,>` directly, instead of traits relying on their own code to load them in a number of different ways.\nAlso `FieldSaver` is not left out, and is able to save them as YAML (for saving maps) and potentially as string, for trait documentation generation.\n\nAs usual, split into nice small easy to review commits.\n\nEasiest way to test this is with my `PlugInit` PR, because that uses both the `FieldLoader` and `FieldSaver` changes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9181","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9181/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9181/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9181/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9181","id":103593381,"number":9181,"title":"Support
