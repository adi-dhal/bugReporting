She won't attack.\n\nThe \"solution\" to this is to move her one step closer. Though it isn't a real solution, she manages to kill it then.\n\nSimilar stuff happened with E3s trying to destroy a flametower.\n\nI find this bug extremely annoying.

Dawn had a Gruesome death sound played when say an infantryman was blown to pieces by an SSM missile or a Napalm Bombing. I think that this engine should support it too, and I would be willing to take it a step further.\n\nI recently pushed some of the unused death sounds to be implemented in C&C 1. They sound nice, but in certain cases, they don't fit. It isn't really fitting when an infantry man is blown to pieces by a tank shell and they just moan. So here would be my idea of the code:\n\nGenericVoice: \n    Variants:\n        nod: .v01,.v03\n        gdi: .v01,.v03\n    Voices:\n        Select: await1,ready,report1,yessir1\n        Move: ackno,affirm1,noprob,ritaway,roger,ugotit\n        Die: nuyell1,nuyell3,nuyell4,nuyell5,nuyell6,nuyell7,nuyell10,nuyell11,nuyell12,yell1\n    DisableVariants: Die\n\nThese are the death sounds I pushed for the next release. If my idea is implemented, then here would be my idea:\n\nGenericVoice: \n    Variants:\n        nod: .v01,.v03\n        gdi: .v01,.v03\n    Voices:\n        Select: await1,ready,report1,yessir1\n        Move: ackno,affirm1,noprob,ritaway,roger,ugotit\n        Die: nuyell1,nuyell3,nuyell4,nuyell5\n                       Variant2: yell1,nuyell5\nWhat this does is that when Death Type 2 is played, it will only play yell1 and nuyell5. The current \"die\" would be used for the default if Variants are not defined. I didn't define Die5 for example. So it should play \"Die\" instead of \"Varient5\"\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2391","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2391/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2391/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2391/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2391","id":6486214,"number":2391,"title":"Chash in the end of the game with Operation is not valid due to the current state of the object exception","user":{"login":"cerebrum","id":459268,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/459268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cerebrum","html_url":"https://github.com/cerebrum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cerebrum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cerebrum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cerebrum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cerebrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cerebrum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cerebrum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cerebrum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cerebrum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cerebrum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2012-08-27T22:15:15Z","updated_at":"2012-09-23T05:47:26Z","closed_at":"2012-09-23T05:47:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"https://gist.github.com/3492786\nReplay is unwatchable.
