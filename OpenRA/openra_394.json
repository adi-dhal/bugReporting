Any help in solving this is appreciated. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2310/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2309","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2309/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2309/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2309/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2309","id":5591492,"number":2309,"title":"Units dont move when ordered to inaccesible terrain","user":{"login":"Kanar","id":1968396,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1968396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kanar","html_url":"https://github.com/Kanar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kanar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kanar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kanar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kanar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kanar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kanar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kanar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kanar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kanar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":124732617,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Pathfinding","name":"Pathfinding","color":"4c4c4c","default":false},{"id":33149887,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Polish","name":"Polish","color":"FF9933","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2012-07-13T08:18:32Z","updated_at":"2015-02-24T19:44:12Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yo,\n\nwhen you ordered infantry units in original game to inaccessible terrain (like hills that could only be accessed by helicopters or planes), they still moved to this directon and moved as close as possible to that destination.\nWhich was a good thing.\n\nIn OpenRA, when you order them to inaccessible terrain, they dont do anything at all.\n\nThis is very annoying, even if it's meant as a feature instead of a bug.\nConsider situations like the following:\n\nYou just started a game and build some riflemen or dogs to explore terrain. Now you want to order them to a certain destination in the shroud, which they should explore.\nNow, it happens very often, that you accidentely click inaccessible terrain when clicking into the shroud.\nIf you're lucky, you notice that your rifemen dont move, and then you have to click into the blue (well, black) as long as you find a destination where they can walk to - which is quite annoying as you cannot see where ur clicking.  O.O\nIts really annoying.\n\nThis is maybe also true for vehicles in OpenRA.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/98159-units-dont-move-when-ordered-to-inaccesible-terrain?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2309/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2308","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2308/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2308/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2308/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2308","id":5585330,"number":2308,"title":"Crash: Attempted to finalize an undisposed DisposableAction","user":{"login":"tpz","id":57913,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/57913?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpz","html_url":"https://github.com/tpz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382357,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Crash","name":"Crash","color":"e10c02","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2012-07-13T00:09:25Z","updated_at":"2014-03-30T13:55:49Z","closed_at":"2013-03-30T15:13:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"``````\nUnhandled Exception: System.InvalidOperationException: Attempted to finalize an undisposed DisposableAction. heli (1118) reserved hpad (982)\n  at OpenRA.Mods.RA.Reservable+<Reserve>c__AnonStorey128.<>m__30A () [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0 \n  at (wrapper delegate-invoke) <Module>:invoke_void__this__ ()\n  at OpenRA.FileFormats.ActionQueue.PerformActions () [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0 \n  at OpenRA.Game.Tick (OpenRA.Network.OrderManager orderManager, OpenRA.Graphics.Viewport viewPort) [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0 \n  at OpenRA.Game.Run () [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0 \n  at OpenRA.Program.Run (System.String[] args) [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0 \n  at OpenRA.Program.Main (System.String[] args) [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0 \n[ERROR] FATAL UNHANDLED EXCEPTION: System.InvalidOperationException: Attempted to finalize an undisposed DisposableAction. heli (1118) reserved hpad (982)\n  at OpenRA.Mods.RA.Reservable+<Reserve>c__AnonStorey128.<>m__30A () [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0 \n  at (wrapper delegate-invoke) <Module>:invoke_void__this__ ()\n  at OpenRA.FileFormats.ActionQueue.PerformActions () [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0 \n  at OpenRA.Game.Tick (OpenRA.Network.OrderManager orderManager, OpenRA.Graphics.Viewport viewPort) [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0 \n  at OpenRA.Game.Run () [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0 \n  at OpenRA.Program.Run (System.String[] args) [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0 \n  at OpenRA.Program.Main (System.String[] args) [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0 ````\n``````\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2308/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2307","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2307/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2307/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2307/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2307","id":5570856,"number":2307,"title":"lag -

It is an OCD of mine to team units the second they come out of the barracks. \n\nSelecting units with the mouse was always a pig of an interface decision in my opinion, you dont have quick or accurate enough control, and you end up with finger strain! plus it isn't any reflection of the intense level of organisation in real world militaries. \n\nPerhaps if you hold control while adding units to the queue, the interface could get the hint and add those units to the first available empty team number, until the numbers are exhausted.  That seems to me the simplest way rather than the most exacting, but since I generally add units to the queue in growth 'spurts', anything more complicated might just be overkill. You can always quickly reassign teams anyway.\n\nProjecting even further, it would be cool to have the teams represented as buttons on the gui somewhere, with little pips and icons - remember Battlezone?\n\nSo that is my two cents - a small feature with large implications. It may just be me, but since the interface is obviously not slavishly constrained to the original model, I thought it might be worth mentioning.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue?
