At each Tick() of the HackyAI, it also Ticks Lua script's Tick(), which controls the unit production. I made a basic implementation of team, task, taskforce (units that do the actions). Current Lua script will build any team it can build in Random. (It does rebuild MCV or build harvesters, siege weapons based on conditions though). By default, teams have no task specified. In this case, HackyAI will take control of it and do hacky movements with it.\r\n4. I have a working team that does specified actions.

gorgeous, crisp, should add some distinction to the official 1v1 pool as they seem to harbor _both_ casual and competitive qualities.\r\n- - - - - - - -\r\n**Removing:**\r\n\r\n- **Barren Land** (2 players)\r\n- **Arctic Triangle Affair** (3 players)\r\n- **Chokepoint** (4 players)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn hindsight, adding Barren Land with the previous release looks like a mistake. The map functions well competitively, isn't outright _un_popular, but it's visually bland and _very_ newcomer unfriendly due to the far distance between the players. \r\n\r\nArctic Triangle stayed during the 2016 overhaul solely because of lack of 3 player FFAs. That has changed as we now have _four_ other well functioning 3 player FFA maps.\r\n\r\nChokepoint has a better-looking twin over at 'Bad Neighbors'. Despite its alteration with #10833 it don't really appeal much to anyone, likely has to do with the access points between the spawns which (compared to its big brother, 'Encounter') doesn't invite to much action or fun.\r\n- - - - - - - -\r\n**Alter:**\r\n\r\n**Snow Off (2 players)**\r\n![snow off orig](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2715583/23716818/dadf3830-0431-11e7-875a-88592b3508b0.png)\r\n\r\n**Vihaan Lunta (4 players)**\r\n![vihaan lunta compare](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2715583/23716824/e1dca2bc-0431-11e7-8096-643ee18081f7.png)\r\n\r\n**Winter Storm (2 players)**\r\n![winter storm compare](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2715583/23725240/18ba3272-0450-11e7-861e-e4f0871eb97a.png)\r\n\r\nSnow Off (added with #12767)being a very small map will have a more rigid presence in the map chooser. A few strokes makes it _slightly_ more crisp (see ridges/debris) so as to fall more in line with its comrades. \r\n\r\nVihaan Lunta's (added with #12767) spawn points don't look too inviting in the original. \r\n\r\nWinter Storm 2 is the original author's own revision including a blessing allowing the PR author equalizing the same amount of oil derrics as with the first map version.

PR\r\n- fixes refinery storage capacity to match TS\r\n- fixes tib silo storage pip to use green color\r\n- fixes values of green and blue tib to match TS\r\n- fixes harvester load/dump delays to match TS\r\n- fixes harvester to not get slowed down by being loaded to match TS\r\n- limits the number of silos AI can build to 2\r\n\r\n**Note1**: The default values for harvester loading and dump rate mentioned on ModEnc don't seem to be correct (or are unused unless the fields are listed in rules.ini), according to my own testing, both harvesting and unloading seems to happen at 15 simulation frames per 'bale' in the original, or 1 second at 15 fps.\r\n**Note2**: Harvesters still harvest faster than in the original, because we're lacking TS' acceleration/decceleration system, which effectively slowed harvesters quite a bit in the original (they never drove at full speed when moving from tiberium patch to tiberium patch, or when approaching/leaving the refinery).\r\n**Note3**: TS had an alternate blue tiberium with identical graphics, but lower value (Aboreus, value 30), that some original maps may actually have used (only seen a tiny bit on Grand Canyon so far, though).\r\n**Note4**: With the huge reduction in tib value and harvest speed, I considered 2 silos more than enough for the AI, it'll probably be completely broke most of the time anyway.\r\n\r\nFixes #12915.\r\nFixes #12916.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12921/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4960","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"CF29:572C:15C58EE:2B4034E:59D6B2C7","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=41>;
