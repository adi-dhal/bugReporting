Perhaps if Firedelay is < 5 then the range checking can be ignored.\n\nAlso: when a unit has been ordered to fire, but is in the FireDelay phase, the firing cannot be aborted by pressing 'S'.

WorldRenderer.\n- A PaletteReference type has been introduced to replace the strings/ints that were previously passed around the engine.\n- System palettes to be ignored by palette modifiers are handled at runtime, removing the need for hardcoded lists.\n- Cleaner color picker palette modification.\n- Cleaner palette initialization.\n- Removed a bunch of explicit and implicit dependencies on RenderSimple (palette lookups).\n- Removed duplicated World/Chrome shaders (this was dumb).\n\nOther Side effects:\n- Referencing undefined palettes fails early, at the point of definition instead of deep in the renderer.\n- Parachutes now work correctly with turreted units.\n- Rally points / GpsDots / Repair indicators now work correctly with actors that don't use the default player palette.\n- Minor perf improvements by caching trait and palette lookups (below the noise level, but visible when comparing screenshots of the perf graph).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2699/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2698","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2698/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2698/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2698/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/2698","id":11353127,"number":2698,"title":"Fix
