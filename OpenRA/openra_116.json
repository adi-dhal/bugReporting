we can fix #10661 we need an idea of how many players this will affect.\nThe battlefield news query runs once per game start, so it gives us a simple way to track active player statistics (unless the player explicitly opts out).\n\nImplementation:\n1. Add a `http://master.openra.net/gamenews` page, which can initially just do a http redirect to http://openra.net/gamenews.\n2.  Change the `NewsUrl` to this new value.\n3. Add an advanced setting for sending system statistics (enabled by default).\n4. If the setting is enabled, send the current mod, `Platform.CurrentPlatform`, `Environment.OSVersion`, and `Platform.RuntimeVersion` (these are the same things we include in exception.log) as either GET or POST data along with the news query.\n5. (can be left until after release) Change the gamenews page to start logging this information so that we look at aggregate OS/usage stats.\n\nIf we want to do anything about #10661 in the next year we really need to get this logging in the next release, so adding to the milestone.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/30385358-use-the-battlefield-news-query-to-send-system-stats-to-the-master-server?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10662/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10661","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10661/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10661/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10661/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10661","id":130142579,"number":10661,"title":"Drop Windows XP and .NET 4.0 support.","user":{"login":"pchote","id":167819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/167819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote","html_url":"https://github.com/pchote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":189987508,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/OS:%20Windows","name":"OS: Windows","color":"5e9fe7","default":false},{"id":10028244,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Packaging","name":"Packaging","color":"bfd4f2","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-01-31T15:55:26Z","updated_at":"2016-05-20T13:30:57Z","closed_at":"2016-05-20T13:30:57Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Maintaining Windows XP support means that we are stuck with .NET 4.0, which is holding us back in a number of ways (which I expect to grow as time goes on):\n1.  We can't fix our broken UPNP support because OpenNAT has only ever supported .NET >= 4.5 (#7140).  This then leads to confusion from people who don't know why we have a port forwarding option that can't obviously be enabled.\n2.  The GeoIP library has recently dropped support for .NET < 4.5, so we are now stuck on an older version that won't receive bugfixes and makes life more difficult for linux packagers (#10280).\n3.  The Roslyn compiler will give us access to much more powerful analysis tools for linting and documentation generation, but can only target the .NET >= 4.5 runtimes.\n4.  Xamarin now only maintain partial support the 4.0 runtime by shipping pre-compiled assemblies (it is no longer possible to compile them from source, AFAIK).   Linux distros such as Fedora and Debian testing will not distribute these, so we can't support OpenRA on these platforms unless the player compiles/installs their own version of mono.\n5. Microsoft have dropped all support for .NET 4.0 (https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/lifecycle?C2=548), and Windows > XP support 4.5.2 or greater.\n\nDepends on #10662.

Our best response \"You don't need to - we provide dedicated servers for this\" falls flat when one of the main game options for casual players is explicitly disallowed on them.\n\nThis is easy to fix and gives a big usability win, so i'm suggesting that we prioritise this for the next release.

friend of mine [topaxi](https://github.com/topaxi) had the idea to paint cliffs randomly of the same type. I couldn't find any functionality or an issue to something similar, so I've created a prototype function:\n\nhttps://github.com/Sapena/OpenRA/tree/similar_terrain_tilesets b86ea5a9d0a422c9da83da76a617939f88688155\n\nThe idea is to be able to drag a line of cliffs and the editor switches automatically the templates, but only using similar tiles. The prototype for now only works with the vertical and horizontal cliffs (Excluding the diagonal cliffs):\n- Horizontal: 135-141, 149-155\n- Vertical: 142-148, 156-162\n\nThe functionality could be applied to other kind of tiles, like water cliffs, roads, etc. Another extended and nice functionality would be, that the editor is able to handle displacements, like moving upwards while dragging a horizontal line.\n\nIs this idea usable? Or just kind of overkill?\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/30370196-random-tileset-terrain-painting?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10652/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10651","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10651/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10651/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10651/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10651","id":130024330,"number":10651,"title":"Add xmldoc to Widget.HandleMouseInput","user":{"login":"Phrohdoh","id":4861023,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4861023?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh","html_url":"https://github.com/Phrohdoh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-01-30T18:57:32Z","updated_at":"2016-01-30T21:11:40Z","closed_at":"2016-01-30T21:06:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/10651","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10651","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10651.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10651.patch"},"body":"cc @pchote, @RoosterDragon\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10651/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10650","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10650/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10650/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10650/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10650","id":130021478,"number":10650,"title":"Remove fragile diplomacy.","user":{"login":"pchote","id":167819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/167819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote","html_url":"https://github.com/pchote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":26,"created_at":"2016-01-30T18:29:08Z","updated_at":"2016-06-08T18:44:27Z","closed_at":"2016-02-06T21:55:55Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/10650","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10650","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10650.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10650.patch"},"body":"This feature has never worked properly, and is implicated in many bugs and polish issues.
