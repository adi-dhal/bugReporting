tick idle and pathfinder lines would spike off the screen every half second.  render would flux between about 5.8-9.2 and tick would be .8-2.2, though it was difficult to read; couldn't get a screen

Currently there is a splash screen, some recolored interface files for each faction and I added some Atreides buildings and the carryall.\n\nHowever I did not add install rules for the Dune 2000 mod as I don't consider this production quality at all. There is a strange flickering bug (maybe palette related). It seems that the Dune 2000 tilesize is not supported by the engine yet. Some buildings don't render completely as frames require to be layed over each other (like the RA weapon factory).\n\nI removed the bitrotted default mod and the palettetest (incorporated into d2k mod).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2154","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2154/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2154/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2154/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/2154","id":4660169,"number":2154,"title":"added

what: This branch demonstrates the possibility of a pause function for the OpenRA game engine.\n\nThe why: when playing with a friend or family member, it is sometimes desired to pause the game. For instance to get a drink or something to eat, when the phone rings, etc. Pausing the game will not ruin your life then, and it also won't ruin your game.\n\nThe how: the usage is very simple now. During the game, one can press the PAUSE key on the keyboard, and the game will pause. The game can be un-paused by pressing the key again.\n\nIn the background the following is done to make this work:\n- The client sends PAUSE GAME REQUEST to the server.\n- The server replies with PAUSE GAME to all clients.\n- From now on, the ordermanager.tick() will not be invoked\n  Note: pause messages are immediate orders (so one can unpause).\n\nSome remarks:\n- Orders can be given, but are queued. The UI will not update these orders until the game un-pauses.\n- It has been tested with 1vs1.\n\nPossible future extentions:\n- Adding a pause option in the game-menu (for keyboards without a pause-key)\n- Freeze the game with a \"pause screen\", where the user can un-pause, resign, chat, and change settings\n- By the game-creating adding a setting which enables/disables the pause-option.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2149/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2148","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2148/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2148/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2148/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2148","id":4611784,"number":2148,"title":"Replay feature cause crash and missing setting to turn it off","user":{"login":"Holloweye","id":637562,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/637562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Holloweye","html_url":"https://github.com/Holloweye","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Holloweye/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Holloweye/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Holloweye/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Holloweye/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Holloweye/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Holloweye/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Holloweye/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Holloweye/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Holloweye/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382357,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Crash","name":"Crash","color":"e10c02","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2012-05-16T19:39:05Z","updated_at":"2013-03-01T11:22:34Z","closed_at":"2013-03-01T11:09:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There is no way to disable the replay feature for mods!
