completion can now properly handle elements (most likely usernames) with whitespace.

Another pet peeve tackled!\n\nI'm not super satisfied with it because I would have liked to avoid rebuilding `relevantSubstrings`, but I didn't really find a more elegant solution. (Suggestions welcome). It might be impossible though because of the immutability of strings and the not-worthiness of having a \"startsWith()\" helper function that works on char arrays.\nIt's O(n*m) (worst case) where m is the average length of the possible elements (nicknames).\n\nI rewrote a good section of the class to increasing modularity and reduce the need to handle corner cases (although some remnants linger).

a fix to a pet peeve which is having to go through \"onhold\" before cancelling an item. Especially frustrating during lag spikes (and misclicks of adding extra units/structures). If we middle click instead of right click, we can now directly cancel an item without interrupting the currently building/training item. This also gives us a lot more versatility in fixing up the queue for long term construction projects. \n\nI also implemented `ctrl + click` to cancel an entire queue, resolving #6082.\n- `Ctrl + leftclick` doesn't do anything (trains one unit, except if it's `ctrl + shift + leftclick` which behaves as `shift + leftclick`.\n- `Ctrl + middleclick`: immediately cancels the whole queue (without going to \"onhold\")\n- `Ctrl + rightclick`: goes to onhold if not already there. If already in onhold, cancels the entire queue.\n\nJust a note: If someone gets the bright idea of implementing modifiers for keyboard hotkeys (like shift+f1 to train 5 items, or ctrl+f1 to cancel an item or something, then it's an exercise in futility since ctrl+f1 won't match the hotkey for the building at all, since it could be binded to something else anyway :p). It's debatable if we care enough to look for some solution to this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9594","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9594/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9594/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9594/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9594","id":110827422,"number":9594,"title":"glitch
