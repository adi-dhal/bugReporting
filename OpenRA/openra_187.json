Inpired by https://github.com/flibitijibibo/SDL2-CS/issues/20#issuecomment-67949509.\n\nThe benefits are:\n- 61 OpenGL extensions loaded instead of EVERYTHING\n- 2,1 MB size reduction of our binary package\n- easier packaging for distros that require to build completely from source\n\nI also removed the OpenAL (and subsequent OpenTK) dependency from OpenRA.Game and placed it into the renderer DLLs, which in fact do a lot more than just rendering nowadays (input, window creation, etc.) so I renamed things to reflect this. This became a bigger job than I thought.

it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8538/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8537","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8537/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8537/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8537/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8537","id":89939731,"number":8537,"title":"Repair
