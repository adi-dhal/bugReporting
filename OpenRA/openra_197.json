OpenTTD also uses SDL2 and looks the same on Android except for some button padding. Not sure what else came at play.\n\nAnother port reference i found are the insights in this 4-part blog series by Julien Jorge:\n- [Porting a C++ game to Android, the case of Andy's Super Great Park](http://blog.stuff-o-matic.com/post/2013/09/07/Porting-a-C-game-to-Android%2C-the-case-of-Andy-s-Super-Great-Park)\n- [ASGP's Android Port Part II: from SDL 1.2 to SDL 2](http://blog.stuff-o-matic.com/post/2013/09/15/ASGP-s-Android-Port-Part-II%3A-from-SDL-1.2-to-SDL-2.)\n- [http://blog.stuff-o-matic.com/post/2013/10/08/ASGP-s-Android-Port-Part-III%3A-from-OpenGL-Direct-Mode-to-GLES](http://blog.stuff-o-matic.com/post/2013/10/08/ASGP-s-Android-Port-Part-III%3A-from-OpenGL-Direct-Mode-to-GLES)\n- [ASGP's Android Port Part IV: building the APK](http://blog.stuff-o-matic.com/post/2013/10/20/ASGP-s-Android-Port-Part-IV%3A-building-the-APK)\n\nNow ofcourse OpenRA is not written in C++..

Initially performance is normal, then ms per Render tick go up from ~5 to ~14ms for a short time-span, and over time these time-spans grow more frequent and longer until it's ~12-14ms/tick all the time (regardless of how much is going on on-screen, btw).\nWith my old Radeon 7790 I didn't have this performance issue, it breezed through at ~4-5ms all the time (latest
