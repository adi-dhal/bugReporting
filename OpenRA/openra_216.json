So sorry, reviewers.\n\nThis is more or less a direct successor to #7300.\n\nI spent quite a while organizing the changes into propper self-contained commits, so I strongly suggest reviewing, and even testing, by commits.\nDespite the nice commit messages, I'm going to sum this up:\n**1.** Make built carryalls spawn at the closest map edge cell instead of spawning at the High Tech facility\n**2.** Do some refactoring to enable 3. and 4.\n**3.** Enable FreeActors to be delivered from outside the map via transport (use case are the D2k harvesters, transported by carryalls; this might also be useful in some missions (TS?), but that's not important at the moment). This uses the closest map edge cell by default, but can be set to spawn at a specific location in the YAML file.\n**4.** Add harvester insurance by attaching a new `HarvesterInsurance` trait to the player actor and making worms call that if they eat a harvester.\n\nSide bonus: the shellmap got a bit more interesting due to the harvester's new harvesting location (the first time you watch it, at least :D ).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7664/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7663","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7663/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7663/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7663/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7663","id":61597923,"number":7663,"title":"kennel placement is blocking dogs from spawning","user":{"login":"TheRaffy","id":5147014,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5147014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheRaffy","html_url":"https://github.com/TheRaffy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheRaffy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheRaffy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheRaffy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheRaffy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheRaffy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheRaffy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheRaffy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheRaffy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheRaffy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":95766782,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Easy","name":"Easy","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":33149887,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Polish","name":"Polish","color":"FF9933","default":false},{"id":21877809,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Red%20Alert","name":"Red Alert","color":"8B0000","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":18,"created_at":"2015-03-14T13:07:36Z","updated_at":"2016-07-30T14:39:31Z","closed_at":"2016-07-30T14:39:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"if you aren't careful while you are placing your kennel building you might end up placing it 1 cell north of another building or unwalkable terrain.
