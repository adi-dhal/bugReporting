fix for #5116 by implementing IDisposable on Texture, FrameBuffer and VertexBuffer rather than relying on the finalizer to do the work since the non-determinism of finalization means these resources could be hanging around for an unbounded length of time before being released.\n\nThis PR ensures almost all of these resources are released deterministically via Dispose (a few stragglers still get finalized since some lifetimes are non-trivial, particularly with textures for sheets allocated by sheet builders, which makes tracking them down difficult).\n\nI don't have any particular proof that this will fix the out-of-memory issue, it just seems like it could be a possible cause.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5923/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5922","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5922/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5922/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5922/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5922","id":37595516,"number":5922,"title":"Continue

However, one thing that needed to be considered was that by removing the isInWorld check, we would then add a regression back to where buildings with a build limit would incorrectly update the tech tree when sold or destroyed (Refer to #5233 for why the isInWorld check was added)\n\nSo, now I've taken it a step further by also filtering out any actor that has the ITechTreePrerequisite trait, for two reasons.  1) All buildings have this trait so it avoids the regression, and 2) any actor that has the ITechTreePrerequisite trait is already properly updated on lines 71 through 84, so there is no reason to do the check again.\n\nThis however creates the assumption:\n\nAnything with ITechTreePrerequisite can only provide a prerequisite if it is in the world.  So for example, if someone creates a mod where a tank provides a prerequisite to a different unit, and that tank is placed in a transport, it will no longer provide the prerequisite, which is a limitation of the current tech system, and a side effect of removing a unit in order to \"place\" it in a transport or structure (pillbox).\n\nI'm fine with this being rejected in favor of doing something different, I just couldn't find another good solution.  One thing I would like to see in the future is a way to \"remove\" units from the gameplay layer (placing in transport or burrowing underground) without having to remove them from the world, but I don't know how that will effect the engine.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5913/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5912","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5912/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5912/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5912/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5912","id":37532476,"number":5912,"title":"Allow NormalizeSequence to remove existing damage prefixes.
