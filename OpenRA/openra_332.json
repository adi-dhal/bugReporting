The sequence and terrain code now use the common interface and lose their special-case hacks.\n\nThe main improvements are:\n- shp(td)/shp(ts)/shp(d2)/r8/tmp(td)/tmp(ra) are supported for both terrain and sequences.\n- OpenRA.Utility --png supports all of the above, and now generates a set of frames instead of a strip.\n- OpenRA.Utility --shp takes a set of frames instead of a strip.\n- Kills the pile of hacks that previously supported .r8 and shp(ts).\n- Significantly simplifies adding additional sprite types in the future.\n\nThis _should_ be relatively low risk, as any errors (wrong filetype identification being the main one) would trigger a crash at the loadscreen.  There isn't a lot of room for subtle errors to live the sprite

still spam these if you had a team, one person builds a Dome while the other guy power plants to the edge of the build radius.\n\nI just thought it and had to bring it up, always good to share ideas
