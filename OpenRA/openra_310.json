Maybe map edges could be extended by a couple of tiles, or maps could have a thin layer at the edges that are visible but not maneuverable. Or the units at the edge could be drawn on top of the shroud. Because shroud outside the map is different than the one inside, it can't be uncovered. Or outside shroud could have different color, which would also help see the map edges at the beginning of the game...\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on

know this is technically Westwoods fault for using such weird facing, but it's still rather noticeable in some cases.\n\nBasically, for example for units with 32 facings, WW used the 4th frame when moving NW, 14th for SW, 20th for SE, 30th for NE, instead of 5,13,21,29 like OpenRA.\n\nThe problem is that Westwoods SHPs were made with their odd approach in mind, not the technically correct approach OpenRA is using. I believe some older versions of OpenRA actually took this into consideration, but some of the refactoring seems to have removed that.\n\nThis is most noticeable when watching harvesters harvest ore/tiberium, because their facing and harvest animation are not fully aligned visually.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4822","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4822/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4822/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4822/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/4822","id":29001253,"number":4822,"title":"Added

proposal for some changes to stances for discussion. Hold fire and return fire remain unchanged.\n- Hold fire - Don't react automatically to enemy units.\n- Return fire - Open fire on the source of any damage, never move. Default stance for stealth units.\n- Hold ground - Open fire on anything that enters range, never move. Default stance.\n- Defend - Scan for targets in an area up to n cells beyond the unit's range from its starting point, move to attack any targets found, return to the starting position when the unit is destroyed or has moved. Default stance for AI.\n- Pursue - Scan for targets in an area up to n cells beyond the unit's range from its current position, move to attack any targets found.\n\nAre there too many stances currently? Would the Defend stance as defined here be more useful than the current AttackAnything stance? Should the default stance for stealth tanks be hold fire, and return fire for snipers?\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/1435583-redefined-stances?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4818","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4818/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4818/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4818/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4818","id":28961503,"number":4818,"title":"Cut sound on window defocus","user":{"login":"pizzaoverhead","id":3650108,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3650108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pizzaoverhead","html_url":"https://github.com/pizzaoverhead","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pizzaoverhead/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pizzaoverhead/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pizzaoverhead/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pizzaoverhead/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pizzaoverhead/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pizzaoverhead/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pizzaoverhead/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pizzaoverhead/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pizzaoverhead/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":416595517,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Audio","name":"Audio","color":"69c6da","default":false},{"id":33149887,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Polish","name":"Polish","color":"FF9933","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-03-07T12:20:33Z","updated_at":"2016-07-30T08:29:06Z","closed_at":"2016-07-30T08:29:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The volume for all sounds should be faded to zero when the OpenRA window loses focus, and restored on regaining focus.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/1435182-cut-sound-on-window-defocus?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4818/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4690","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"8218:572D:14152AF:30C44FA:59D6B920","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=311>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=405>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=309>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"5d39f1961d40fdfcea7308f0e9a8bf0d\"","status":"200 OK"}}
