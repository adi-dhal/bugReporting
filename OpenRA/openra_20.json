This PR fixes the issue for Windows and Linux (just deb here, but downstream packaging is also expected to adopt this) by pre-registering mods during installation.\r\n\r\nA new \"system support\" directory is defined at:\r\n* Windows: `C:\\ProgramData\\OpenRA\\` ([spec](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/s2esdf4x(v=vs.100).aspx))\r\n* Linux: `/var/games/openra/` ([spec](http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/ch05s07.html))\r\n* macOS: `/Library/Application Support/OpenRA/`\r\n\r\nand a `ModMetadata` subdirectory is created and populated for ra/td/d2k.  These are left read-only for normal users to avoid a malicious user from changing the `LaunchPath` to something nasty.\r\n\r\nCloses #12764 and implements the first steps towards #10374.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13538","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13538/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13538/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13538/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13538","id":238198485,"number":13538,"title":"Add ReloadAmmoPool trait","user":{"login":"reaperrr","id":2857877,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2857877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperrr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/20","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestone/20","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/20/labels","id":2202516,"number":20,"title":"Next + 1","description":"","creator":{"login":"pchote","id":167819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/167819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote","html_url":"https://github.com/pchote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":29,"closed_issues":14,"state":"open","created_at":"2016-12-17T20:43:34Z","updated_at":"2017-09-30T16:58:10Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-06-23T16:55:56Z","updated_at":"2017-09-22T12:15:09Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/13538","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13538","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13538.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13538.patch"},"body":"First step towards #9613.\r\n\r\nThis adds a `ReloadAmmoPool` trait, splits the `AmmoPool` reload logic into a method that can be called externally, and gets rid of the `AmmoPool.SelfReloads`-related properties.\r\n\r\nThe 3rd commit looks more intimidating than it really is, but if push comes to shove, I can split it off to a follow-up PR along the upgrade rule.\r\n\r\nNote: I've tested the upgrade rule myself -

This appears to work if you only have moves in the queue (since the later orders will do the same thing, and the final moves all run in the same order), but breaks badly as soon as you have anything else in there.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the pathfinder-delay and nearest-movable-cell checks into the activity itself, with a flag to enable these only for player-issued orders.

#8593.\r\n\r\nMusic is now streamed! Changing music tracks no longer causes a lag spike or freezes the UI.\r\n\r\n- Adds support for streaming in our audio engine via `Play2DStream`.\r\n- Our sound manager now chooses to stream music, rather than caching it fully in memory (other sounds still use the caching mechanism).\r\n- `AudFormat` is updated to support streaming, rather than having to load all the data into memory and expose a `MemoryStream`.\r\n\r\nWhile testing, please listen out for:\r\n- Choppy music (e.g. gaps in playback)\r\n- Glitchy music (e.g. the music track seems to skip backwards a second or two and replay itself)\r\n- Incorrect music (e.g. you try playing a music track and it plays another sound effect instead)\r\n\r\nOther things to note:\r\n- When you play a music track, it may take a few seconds to start. This is normal.\r\n- If you switch music tracks several times really quickly, you will still be able to freeze the UI. This is a known limitation.\r\n\r\nFinally, it would probably be worth also updating `VocFormat` and `WavFormat` in a similar way to support streaming audio - otherwise those formats won't benefit. Once my brain is less fried I may get to it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13521/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":3,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4980","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"CDFF:572B:D672C4:1C56B6E:59D6B278","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=21>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=405>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=19>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"e9f16e644c751a1e89a025469b1ea1fd\"","status":"200 OK"}}
