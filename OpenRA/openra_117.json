I find it rather annoying that players cannot decide themselves whether they want the harvester resource search radius to be limited for safety reasons (like now), or search in a larger radius, possibly whole map at the risk of running into enemies (like AI already does).\n\nA possibility would be to allow players to let harvesters search for further away resources automatically by giving the harvester a 'deploy' command (similar to the Chrono Tank 'deploy').\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on

removes some duplication and should improve AI performance by reducing frequency of the more expensive AI resource search.\n\nIssues fixed by this PR:\n- `Harvester.UnblockRefinery` was not just unblocking, but also performing a resource claim and queueing a `FindResources` activity (which would then perform another resource claim). \n- The `ContinueHarvesting` method would queue another `FindResources` after `UnblockRefinery`, resulting in potentially queueing `FindResources` twice.\n- In `FindResources`, if no harvestable position was found, it would perform `harv.UnblockRefinery` and its own unblock at the same tick due to a bogus if check.\n- the AI was making the assumption that a `Wait`ing harvester is idle. That is plain wrong, as `Wait` activities are intentionally queued by all harvester-related activities. This resulted in far too many expensive AI resource

Almost 10 attack-move orders sent, target lines straight to the service depot. All the mammoth tanks died, obviously.\nThey really act like buildings or vehicles are the most important thing to target, or like the first target seen must be destroyed at any cost (this happened with the service depot : they started to attack it and the bazookas finally came close to them but with tons of new attack-move orders they only wanted to attack the service depot)\nIf you send (fast) attack-move orders while retreating, at one time the closest enemy will be the only one they can see so they will finally attack him.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a

was playing around with .Lua AI for custom missions and I found out that the \"Build\" function can get the AI stuck while training units if they don't have the necessary prerequisites to train that

won't train Light or Medium tanks either, even though they don't need radar to train, they simply get stuck. I managed to workaround it by performing a constant check if the AI has the prerequisites for each unit it will try to build, but I thought this should be mentioned to the devs. Thanks and sorry if
