I've also created a trait `ResourceDisplay` which implements the interface provides all of the current UI logic for resources.\n\nThis will make it easier for mods to customize their resource displays while reusing the existing chrome bits, and reduce the coupling of the UI code on the structure of resources.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10391/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10390","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10390/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10390/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10390/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10390","id":124629159,"number":10390,"title":"Spectator only beacons","user":{"login":"Aaron-Lloyd","id":5572430,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5572430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaron-Lloyd","html_url":"https://github.com/Aaron-Lloyd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaron-Lloyd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaron-Lloyd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaron-Lloyd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaron-Lloyd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaron-Lloyd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaron-Lloyd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaron-Lloyd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaron-Lloyd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaron-Lloyd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382407,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"02d7e1","default":false},{"id":124120259,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/UI","name":"UI","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2016-01-03T04:55:31Z","updated_at":"2017-06-18T21:15:50Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Would be nice for specs to be able to point things out to eachother.

outlines my plan for fixing our issues relating to zoom, custom resolutions, and HiDPI support in one fell swoop.  I've referred to it several times in the past, so I figure it is time to document this properly.  From my perspective this supersedes all the previous tickets, but of course others are free to argue against this.\n\n**User interface**\n\nTwo new dropdowns are included in the display settings: UI resolution and World resolution (like UT3 and i'm sure other games have done).  They contain values for \"Native\", a selection of popular defaults with a fixed width and a height calculated from the aspect ratio, and a \"custom\" option that exposes text fields for entering a manual width.  These set the (fixed) size of the UI, and the default size/zoom of the world.\n\nPlayers can use ctrl + scroll to arbitrarily zoom the world (but not the UI) between the minimum and maximum limits (explained below).  The `.` key (currently used for pixel doubling) is used to reset the world to the default zoom configured in the settings.\n\n**Implementation**\n\nThe world rendering (everything that scales with the world, so this excludes selection decorations, target lines, etc) is rendered into a framebuffer that is configured a viewport size calculated from the zoom and default resolution, and the result is rendered using a quad covering the window viewport.  The UI rendering (everything else from the world, and then the widgets) is similarly rendered first into a framebuffer (maybe the same as the first, depending on the cost of reconfiguring a buffer vs switching to a new one), and then scaled to fill the screen.\n\nThe default \"Native\" value is calculated by the window / display size divided by the native pixel scale (queried from SDL).  The pixel scale will be 2 for retina displays under OSX, or between 0.75 and 2 (I think?) for the different DPI options under Windows.  We can calculate the pixel scale by comparing the resolution that we asked for with the output from [SDL_GetRendererOutputSize](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_GetRendererOutputSize).  The minimum supported resolution is defined in mod.yaml (with defaults for our mods of 1024 x 700), and the maximum values are queried from the GPU (the smaller of `GL_MAX_RENDERBUFFER_SIZE` / `GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE`).\n\nTo enable HiDPI rendering we need to set `SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI` when [creating the window](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_CreateWindow), and under OSX we also need to set `NSHighResolutionCapable` in Info.plist.  I have no idea how DPI scaling works across the various linux WMs or whether they are supported by SDL.\n\nThe world is always rendered with a \"zoom\" of 1 into the framebuffer, so all of the fiddly code using Viewport.Zoom can be removed (yay!).  The shader-level hack for rendering the depth buffer can also be removed in favour of rendering the depth texture from the framebuffer.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a
