Also their contrail looks better in the original.\r\n- [ ] **4.** Dune 2000 used an interesting-looking stealth effect that we don't have.

many trait look-ups from Tick (or other actions) to constructors.\nPerformance gains are likely negligible, but this also makes the affected code more consistent with traits and activities where this had already been done.\nAdditionally extracted `FlyOffMap` and `HarvestResource` activities into their own files, and moved harvesting-related activities into their own subfolder.\n\nA couple of notes:\n- There are a few more cases (aircraft attack activities and `Repariable` trait, for example) which I intentionally omitted since they're already part of #7324.\n- I also omitted `FindResources` for now, because I had trouble dealing with that 'double'-constructor, my attempts compiled fine but crashed the game at launch. Feel free to make suggestions on how to deal with those constructors.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7671/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7670","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7670/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7670/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7670/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7670","id":61916105,"number":7670,"title":"release 20141029 crashes after 5 minutes of playing a game","user":{"login":"SovietsWillRiseAgain","id":11492980,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11492980?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SovietsWillRiseAgain","html_url":"https://github.com/SovietsWillRiseAgain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SovietsWillRiseAgain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SovietsWillRiseAgain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SovietsWillRiseAgain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SovietsWillRiseAgain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SovietsWillRiseAgain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SovietsWillRiseAgain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SovietsWillRiseAgain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SovietsWillRiseAgain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SovietsWillRiseAgain/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382357,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Crash","name":"Crash","color":"e10c02","default":false},{"id":189987383,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/OS:%20Linux","name":"OS: Linux","color":"5e9fe7","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2015-03-15T23:01:31Z","updated_at":"2015-06-06T12:13:56Z","closed_at":"2015-06-06T12:13:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"OS: Debian Testing 64 bit \n\nHardware: sony vaio pro 13, hd 4400 gpu\n\nDE: Happens in both Gnome and KDE \n\nReelease: openra_release.20141029_all.deb\n\nLaunching from the terminal started OpenRa fine however after 5 mins of a local skirmish match it crashed.
