my KKnD mod, i need at last 2 different Map-Layers. Thats why i'll explain two approaches: The one which would fit my needs, and the \"done-right\"-way.\r\n\r\n**The bare minimum**\r\nFor KKnD, i need a top Layer which is drawn over all non-flying aircrafts. This includes projectiles except bomber bombs and artillery fire. In the CnC games maps are consisting of either terrain or placed buildings. That allows them to be actors actualy. In KKnD, buildings are part of the terrain and tileset. Also in KKnD buildings can be extremely large, which would result in blocking a lot of tiles if placed on ground level. Thats why the originally KKnD map format has a second layer. The second layer contains tiles, which units can move behind/under. Here is an example:\r\nhttp://www.gamersglobal.de/sites/gamersglobal.de/files/galerie/kknd2_04.jpg\r\nAnd here are the actual KKnD Maps decompiled and rendered per-layer:\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8R1h_nsUmf6eDZVWXROYS1JbWs\r\nThe maps .bin format could be extended in several ways:\r\n\r\n1. Just make the tiles block twice as large, adding a full second layer. But this would make all maps files larger, and most mods do not need this feature.\r\n2. Add a second tiles offset, which if not 0 points to a top-layer. Makes all other maps exactly 4 bytes larger.\r\n3. Add a single byte before the tile offsets containing the number-of-layers, followed by the same amount of tile offsets. This would make other maps eactly 1 byte larger.\r\n\r\nThis also requires the renderer to call the render function n-times. Instead of rendering terrain, followed by actors, it has to call both with the layer parameter. Not sure about performance here, but might be a good idea to encapsulate actors into some per-layer-sets, so you do not have to read all the actors twice and checking their layer. Because flying units have to be on layer 1\r\n\r\nA General problem would be that OpenRA allows you to use tileID 0. So there is no unused or null tile. This means that either:\r\n\r\n1. tileID 0 should get forbidden in tilesets and has to be moved. (0x000000 in the .bin, and also my favourite)\r\n1. a specific tile has to be reserved for \"unused\" (im for using 0xFFFFFF in the .bin)\r\n2. a tileset can define a single tileID as \"empty\".\r\n\r\n**The right way (as i think it is)**\r\nOpenRA already has heights. Basically its just a property a tile can have. Thats why i suggest moving towards a 3D tiled map. (It does not have to be rendered in 3d!) A map will not only have a width (x) and height (y), but also layers (z). Layers are the equivalent of the current height implementation. However its possible to actualy place multiple tiles at the same x,y position, if their z position differs. (Think of Minecraft worlds). This allows the world to be rendered layer by layer, or by rendering the highest tile per x,y plus the tile beneath if it uses the alpha palette color. This also allows things like bridges-over-bridges. Also this information can be used for visibility checks (needed by KKnD 2).\r\n\r\nTo make units drive up/down to another layer, specific tiles could be marked as slopes. This would allow mods to actualy stretch the battlefield across multiple layers. Here an example from Metal Fatigue:\r\nBasicaly you start on the ground level, building up your base, building units etc:\r\nhttp://www.myabandonware.com/media/screenshots/m/metal-fatigue-bx5/metal-fatigue_15.jpg\r\nThen you are able to build an elevator, which allows you to send units underground. There you have to dig through a place you like, place another elevator and voila, you got a tunnel setup.\r\nhttp://www.myabandonware.com/media/screenshots/m/metal-fatigue-bx5/metal-fatigue_16.jpg\r\nThis allows realy interesting ambush tactics. This game also uses a \"cloud\" layer. You can send units up using a transport aircraft and establish another base there.\r\nhttp://www.myabandonware.com/media/screenshots/m/metal-fatigue-bx5/metal-fatigue_13.jpg\r\nThe only thing the engine has to allow for this, is a simple way to set visible layers. Either see all at once, or see all till a specific tile, or see only one at once.\r\n\r\nWith this solution, some other interesting features can be used:\r\n- Crashing planes will not teleport upwards a cliff when they crash down on the lower side.\r\n- Units might see or shoot up/down a hill, or not.\r\n- Units might shoot further if shooting downwards.\r\n- Artillery firing from below a bridge wont make projectiles go straight through the bridge as it hits the tiles above.\r\n\r\nFor the editor a simple layer widget has to be added, which allows to toggle layer visibility, plus set the current working layer. All newly placed actors and tiles will be placed at this layer. Tilesets may define templates involving multiple layers at once. For example a building template will place at the current layer, but its top-parts will automatically be placed on the layer above.\r\n\r\nAs this is a rather big feature, i expect this being discussed heavily before someone starts working on it. It would also require to be split down into multiple smaller feature implementations.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13363","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13363/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13363/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13363/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13363","id":231766591,"number":13363,"title":"Frozen attack fix","user":{"login":"tohava","id":329651,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/329651?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tohava","html_url":"https://github.com/tohava","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tohava/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tohava/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tohava/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tohava/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tohava/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tohava/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tohava/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tohava/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tohava/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":117739713,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Changes%20requested","name":"PR: Changes requested","color":"e11d21","default":false},{"id":118248490,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Has%20dependencies","name":"PR: Has dependencies","color":"fbca04","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/13","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestone/13","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/13/labels","id":930452,"number":13,"title":"Future","description":"This milestone is meant for stuff we want fixed, but don't have a timeline for yet.
