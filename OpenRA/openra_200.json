now there hasn't been need for the videos.\n#8117 introduces the first use-case.\n\n~~I didn't add all videos, because chances are it would be a while before they are needed, and currently `\\OpenRA\\Content\\d2k\\` is a mess which I hope I (or even better - someone else ;) ) will fix soon (caused by the way `ContentInstaller`, `InstallFromCDLogic` and `InstallUtils` don't care about target directory, they just dump everything in `\\OpenRA\\Content\\<mod>\\`).~~\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nOK this got expanded quite a bit. Here is what you can find:\n- The content installer now actually cares about what file should go in what directory. (Right now D2k's Content directory contains 3 empty directories and 260 files (without the videos) dumped in the root dir. This makes it much better.) This would also be useful for RA2, seing it has a ton of files as well.\n- D2k now gets videos (that was in the first push)\n- The VQA player now doesn't crash on D2k videos (that was also in the first push)\n- Fixes errors when installing game assets via the Install Music button. (or at least fixes some of the cases when that happens, there is still one case left, as I mentioned [here](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6242#issuecomment-100659964))\n\nFixes #6117.\n\nThe added check in `Format80` is to prevent `IndexOutOfRange` exceptions in `Format80.ReplicatePrevious()`. I've been told TD and RA videos still play.\n\nI tested RA and D2k extensively both with Copy from CD and Download assets.\n\nNotes:\n- D2k downloads 1 file more than is copied from the CD - PALETTE.BIN  (I have nothing to do with this, but we should figure out whether we need that file).\n- Downloading the assets will not place the tilesets in the correct (new) directory for some reason.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8119/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4800","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"DC9C:572D:13F8C6E:3080561:59D6B532","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=201>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=405>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=199>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"7f97dff0105a1ab0b13dc5fb579a7071\"","status":"200 OK"}}
