had an unintended side-effect of enabling health bar rendering for actors that have the `SelectionDecorations` trait but not `Selectable` (previously it required both).\n\nThis goes through and explicitly disables the health bars for _most_ of the actors that didn't show them before, either by removing `SelectionDecorations` completely (fields, flags, and that nasty `Colt` actor) or keeping `SelectionDecorations` but disabling health bars (badgers, C&C landing craft, KOTH capture points, barrels, ammo boxes, oil derrick husks).\n\nThis keeps the accidentally enabled health bars for the support chinooks and landing craft in missions: these are normal actors that you just can't control, so I figured it made sense to keep the bars for these.\n\nFixes

This doesn't appear to be the encoding of the text and therefore results in sadness.\n\nRather than using both `Marshal.PtrToStringX` and `Encoding.Y` and risk having the two be out of sync we can make things simpler by marshalling the buffer as null-separated bytes. Then all we have to do is guess the right encoding. I'm hoping our current choice of the system code page (`Encoding.Default`) is correct. It depends what `alcGetString` is using as the encoding (the documentation does not clarify).\n\nWorks on my machine - if anybody has sound devices that have non-ASCII names it would be great if you
