mobile.GetAvailableSubCell(nextCell, SubCell.Any, ignoredActor);`\n`Mobile.GetAvailableSubCell`: `return Info.GetAvailableSubCell(...)`\n`MobileInfo.GetAvailableSubCell`:\n\n``` csharp\n            if

around these parts though, so I'm not sure if we should just fix it with the patch below, or do something else in case this is just part of a bigger problem. In particular, I wonder why `PopPath` would return a position with an invalid subcell (ie. where the movement cost is `int.MaxValue`) in the first place.\n\n``` diff\ndiff --git a/OpenRA.Mods.Common/Activities/Move/Move.cs b/OpenRA.Mods.Common/Activities/Move/Move.cs\nindex 5ff3ee0..0f6c4c5 100644\n--- a/OpenRA.Mods.Common/Activities/Move/Move.cs\n+++ b/OpenRA.Mods.Common/Activities/Move/Move.cs\n@@ -378,7 +378,9 @@ protected override MovePart OnComplete(Actor self, Mobile mobile, Move parent)\n                                {\n                                        if (IsTurn(mobile, nextCell.Value.First))\n                                        {\n-                                               var nextSubcellOffset = self.World.Map.OffsetOfSubCell(nextCell.Value.Second);\n+                                               var nextSubCell = nextCell.Value.Second;\n+                                               var nextSubcellOffset = nextSubCell != SubCell.Invalid ? self.World.Map.OffsetOfSubCell(nextSubCell) : WVec.Zero;\n                                                var ret = new MoveFirstHalf(\n                                                        Move,\n                                                        Util.BetweenCells(self.World, mobile.FromCell, mobile.ToCell) + (fromSubcellOffset + toSubcellOffset) / 2,\n\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7629","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7629/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7629/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7629/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7629","id":60337108,"number":7629,"title":"Add a changelog entry for the PRs that move generic RTS code to Mods.Common","user":{"login":"penev92","id":7137365,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7137365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92","html_url":"https://github.com/penev92","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":68514002,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Documentation","name":"Documentation","color":"5319e7","default":false},{"id":95766782,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Easy","name":"Easy","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2015-03-09T12:38:41Z","updated_at":"2015-03-21T14:49:06Z","closed_at":"2015-03-21T13:39:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I've been wanting to do this for a long time and I finally got some time.
