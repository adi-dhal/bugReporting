are always cheaters or bad losers who do anything to spoil the game for everyone if the outcome of the game isn't what they wanted.\n\nThis is the main reason why crashes shouldn't be allowed for things on which the users can affect with tools or OpenRA itself.\n\nThe other reason is that we players can't know every possible crash, so we are afraid to try things that aren't expected, because unexpected behaviour results into a crash. Just like the Dog-bug I found recently; nobody thought of trying to attack barrels with a dog before, or they were just afraid to do so.\n\nCurrently this is all we can do:\n![Praying](http://i6.minus.com/ibjvmEihHDTjrH.jpg)\n\nAs an atheist I know that praying isn't going to fix anything, but it's all we have now.\n\nI have looked up the player activity stats and the future isn't pretty: players are going away from this game at a constant rate. There are now half the amount of players as there were 1-2 years ago.\n\nWould Angry Birds (or other popular games) have got over billion downloads if it crashed (or froze) in 50% of the games you play?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4329/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4328","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4328/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4328/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4328/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/4328","id":24481933,"number":4328,"title":"Polish crate rendering","user":{"login":"pchote","id":167819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/167819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote","html_url":"https://github.com/pchote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/4/labels","id":218441,"number":4,"title":"release-20131223","description":"The next stable release should not have obvious glitches or horrible crasher bugs left.","creator":{"login":"chrisforbes","id":128877,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/128877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisforbes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":168,"state":"closed","created_at":"2012-11-25T20:08:34Z","updated_at":"2015-12-24T15:12:45Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2013-12-23T01:51:53Z"},"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-12-18T10:42:03Z","updated_at":"2014-06-28T21:20:26Z","closed_at":"2013-12-18T22:46:53Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/4328","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/4328","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/4328.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/4328.patch"},"body":"This disables palette modifiers (including player remap) for crates, and tweaks the regular crates in C&C (adds shadow) and RA (fixes floating frames).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4328/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4327","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4327/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4327/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4327/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/4327","id":24477710,"number":4327,"title":"Persist custom map package contents on save.

Of course, each TRAN would be capable to transport one vehicle.\n\nI guess the best way to implement this would be the creation of a vehicles-light.yaml file and a VehiclesLight vehicle class, as add the _Passenger: Weight: big number_ to vehicles that should not be allowed to be air-lifted will affect their capability to be transported by sea.

now, even large buildings like Construction Yards are technically no easier to hit than silos, defenses or standing vehicles.\n\nThis is not only unrealistic, but also not in line with the original, where a direct hit to any cell occupied by a building would deal full damage.\n\nMy suggestion would be to give buildings sized 2x2 and larger appropriate HealthRadiuses, but of course in terms of balancing that might open a can of worms initially because inaccurate artillery weapons would become much more effective against large buildings, so this would need quite a bit of testing and fine-tuning.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on
