Rather than swerving around them to get to their destination, they will tailgate them until the entire force becomes a liability. This can especially be a problem when you're trying to reinforce a contested area of a map or an overwhelmed truck (Harv or Ore).\r\n\r\nThe weird thing is, the ONLY time that vehicles do try to take detours is when there's a bridge or shallow crossing however, this also has faults. That's one of the only times you don't want the to take a detour. Whenever they try to detour, they would opt to find the most \"Harold and Kumar Goes to White Castle\"-esque alternate path they can find rather than using the extra shallow crossing or bridge that sits beside the occupied bridge; meaning they would trek to the opposite end of the map to find another opening if you don't stop them.\r\n\r\nThis issue can also sometimes be seen with VTOLs (helis or choppers in both games) as well.\r\nIf you have a group of maybe 5+ VTOLs, the one furthest back in the hovering cluster won't bother to weave around to get a clear shot of a target but, would instead accept its at the back of the line and not attack at all. \r\nFor friendly aircraft, there should be some compromise where they can \"pass through\" each other; going with the idea that they are simply elevated high that another unit so they can all hit their assigned targets (like in the old games).\r\n\r\nAn even bigger issue though, is if a vehicle (like a tank) or an infantry is being hit by an enemy outside of their range (even by one tile), they will take the beatings until you tell them to go after the target or until you hear that the unit was lost.\r\n\r\n\"Neutral\" Civilians also don't make any effort to dodge vehicles and vehicles don't bother to detour around them either. I don't even think running over units gives XP either so there's no real benefit to it either.\r\n\r\nOn a positive note, I would say that the infantry does try to actively avoid getting run over by vehicles (sometimes). \r\n\r\nI'm not trying to sound negative, don't get me wrong. I LOVE OpenRA but, I often find myself playing skirmishes than  multiplayer because I was one of those guys that didn't know online CnC was a thing in the 90s so by the time I find out, I missed the boat (EA ruined everything). \r\nOpenRA is pretty good but, I would love to see it work towards its full potential by fixing issues that weren't even in the original games (some of them at least). In fact, I can't even play Tiberium Wars or old RA or TD anymore because there's so many improvements in OpenRA.\r\n\r\nThe only reason I'm being so critical with this stuff is because I (and most of us) know we probably won't ever get another real C&C game and OpenRA is the closest thing we'll ever get to that. \r\n\r\nWith mushy crap outta the way, thanks and keep on doing what you're doing.\r\nAs I've stated in other posts, I don't have the slightest idea on how to code or program things, I just know how to make maps prettier than they should be.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12845/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12844","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12844/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12844/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12844/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12844","id":210141736,"number":12844,"title":"\"Real

However, this change also delays the early game phase by 8 seconds. In order to minimize the effect of time with regards to the balance of future playtests, I propose decreasing the cost and build time of the War Factory in order to normalize the timing of the crucial second MCV. This change will have a minimal effect on subsequent MCVs since those MCVs are not dependent on the timing of of the War Factory or Service Depot. \r\n\r\nThis change would also accelerate the early economy and scouting relative to the normalized MCV timing, so players will have additional resources and tools to deal with base pushes. In addition, the lower cost will give players more opportunities to deviate away from mass infantry in late-game situations, as well as expand the types of early game skirmishes that could occur. \r\n\r\n**MCV**\r\nSpeed decreased from 85 to 75\r\n\r\nIn addition to the $2500, 40s MCV, the community has also been experimenting with a change to the MCV speed. The suggested change is mostly qualitative and intended to allow players a few more seconds to react to aggressive MCV movements. This change also helps normalize the build time of the second MCV due to the previously mentioned $1650 War Factory. The 11% decrease in travel time increases the time needed to get to the natural, single ore mine on Sidestep by roughly 3-5 seconds, depending on the location of the War Factory. \r\n\r\nIt is in my opinion that the aforementioned changes, in combination with the MCV cost changes, will provide a more stable platform to perform future balance changes on. These changes have been tested for approximately 1 month, and during that time, it has received a majority positive feedback from both casual and competitive players. \r\n\r\nAlso, this is my first pull request...I apologize if I have missed something or done something wrong \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12840/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12839","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12839/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12839/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12839/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12839","id":209919414,"number":12839,"title":"(All games) Repair cursor does not allow L-click drag select","user":{"login":"danbeyer","id":22333654,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/22333654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbeyer","html_url":"https://github.com/danbeyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbeyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbeyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbeyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbeyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbeyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbeyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbeyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbeyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbeyer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382407,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"02d7e1","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-02-23T23:47:47Z","updated_at":"2017-02-24T21:22:09Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"In the original C&C (not sure about D2K / Red Alert) you were able to left-click and drag select with the repair option selected with the repair cursor.
