Selection boxes of larger units are larger than an in-game cell, and as such 'overlap' horizontally with similar units to either side\n2. Health bars are outside of a units selection box and float into the selection boxes of other units vertically above\n\nLarger units currently have larger selection boxes which clip over other unit selection boxes. This means that such units that are horizontally adjacent have their health bars overlapping. For particularly 'large' units like the mammoth, you can have a unit take ~20% damage, but look like its at full health because of this overlap. Same for pips and passenger capacity.\n\nSecondly, because the health bars of units are outside of the units selection box, when two units are vertically adjacent the health bar of the lower vehicle sites inside the selection box of the above vehicle. From a UI perspective this is slightly misleading.\n![selection_boxes](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3636652/10311025/d702795e-6c3c-11e5-89aa-774a5144b95c.png)\nAs you can see, the med tank and heavys selection boxes overlap, and as such, so do their health bars. \n\nI propose two changes to solve this;\n1. Any actor that occupies an entire cell should have a selection box the exact size of that cell\n2. The health bar should be lowered slightly to sit within the selection box\n\nlike so; (ignore the poorly cropped med)\n\nselected\n![selection_boxes_proposed](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3636652/10321641/b9f0b1a2-6c71-11e5-8a66-eabf4059745c.png)\nunselected\n![selection_boxes_proposed_unselect](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3636652/10321695/f7bc92a8-6c71-11e5-8ac3-a2f0372da2ec.png)\n\nAs you can see, when selected unit selection boxes (and health bars) no longer overlap.

the commit description:\n\n> This fixes a crash that happens when you try to launch a mod directly while its assets aren't installed.\n> Additionally should reduce the overhead for dedicated servers (in theory).\n\nThis only moves things around.\n- The asset validation check was moved to an earlier point, because on bleed the game crashes because it tries to load the assets before checking whether they are available.\n- The asset validation check now uses `File.Exists()` instead of `GlobalFileSystem.Exists()` because at that point in time the files aren't loaded yet.\n- All asset loading and initializing is moved _after_ the dedicated server check. In theory that should save some unnecessary loading for those.\n\n**Note:** I am unsure whether removing this from the dedicated server loading will have any unwanted effects, so someone more familiar with that should take a look:\n\n```\n                PerfHistory.Items[\"render\"].HasNormalTick = false;\n                PerfHistory.Items[\"batches\"].HasNormalTick = false;\n                PerfHistory.Items[\"render_widgets\"].HasNormalTick = false;\n                PerfHistory.Items[\"render_flip\"].HasNormalTick = false;\n\n                JoinLocal();\n```\n\nI did try setting up a dedicated server and joining it (jaZz_KCS set it up) and it all worked fine.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9537/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9536","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9536/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9536/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9536/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9536","id":109680566,"number":9536,"title":"Experience added to Player Actor, Statistics","user":{"login":"Phoib","id":1384555,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1384555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phoib","html_url":"https://github.com/Phoib","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phoib/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phoib/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phoib/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phoib/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phoib/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phoib/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phoib/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phoib/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phoib/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":117739713,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Changes%20requested","name":"PR: Changes requested","color":"e11d21","default":false},{"id":117740707,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Rebase%20me!","name":"PR: Rebase me!","color":"eb6420","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2015-10-04T13:10:41Z","updated_at":"2015-12-31T20:16:58Z","closed_at":"2015-12-29T11:50:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/9536","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9536","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9536.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9536.patch"},"body":"In order to eventually facilitate Support Powers as featured in Generals, I added the Trait PlayerExperience.
