so this is a big one, with a lot of code changes in the weapon and warhead code, along with their associated tie-in points.\n\nAs such, we probably need very thorough testing. I've done as many tests as I can over the course of doing this, but at some point we probably need more people chipping in on the testing effort.\n\nI've tested all 4 mods after running the new UpgradeRules (engine version 20140720) on the mods (weapons.yaml update). So far I have only found one possible regression that I couldn't nail down. It is in D2K, but I cannot reliably reproduce it. See #2641.\n\nThis supersedes #5882.\n\nA quick \"How To\" guide for making new custom warheads using this branch can be found here: http://pastebin.com/xUg2bfT5\n\nThis pull request includes some changes to the yaml (and thus balance) of RA and TD. We probably want to discard these before the pull request is finally accepted, and rerun the UpgradeRules code on a 'clean' set of yaml code for RA and TD.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6005/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6004","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6004/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6004/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6004/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6004","id":38262365,"number":6004,"title":"Introduce a TransformOnUpgrade trait","user":{"login":"reaperrr","id":2857877,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2857877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperrr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382407,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"02d7e1","default":false},{"id":41025558,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Tiberian%20Sun","name":"Tiberian Sun","color":"eb6420","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-07-20T17:29:36Z","updated_at":"2014-12-08T06:16:36Z","closed_at":"2014-12-08T06:16:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This could possibly be used for the Component Tower -> Turret Upgrade for TS.\n\nFor mods that are more than just C&C remakes, it could also be used to give units an additional barrel, different graphics etc.\n\nCould be a quite interesting feature, especially in combination with #6003 (gaining additional weapon via upgrade, losing it when critically damaged).\n\n<bountysource-plugin>\n\n---\n\nWant to back this issue?

RA's mouse.shp went from 164532 to 37260 bytes. TD missmake.shp went down from 59654 to 28206 bytes.
