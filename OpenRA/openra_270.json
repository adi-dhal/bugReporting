I suggest that, while with the mouse you have a wall-piece, and you're deciding where to put it, you can limit the cell-row completion feature, pressing Left-Shift (to just put a single piece of wall, in the highlined cell), or Left-CTRL, just to have a more limited row-completion (of just around 5/6 cells-lenght), in order to ease the creation of siege protection walls around turrets. \n\nIt would be a good idea having, by default, to put just one piece of wall and then, if the player want, extend the cell-lenght coverage, using the CTRL or Shift keyboard buttons.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6032/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6031","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6031/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6031/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6031/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6031","id":38416377,"number":6031,"title":"Add
