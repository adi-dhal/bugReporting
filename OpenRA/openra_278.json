fixes #5300, but actually it does a lot more than that. \n- The split of WithActiveAnimation from SeedsResource removes the rendering related stuff from logic Tick to TickRender like https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5640 does for all other traits that did not hide their rendering abilities from me. It also removes the need to define fake active animations that are identical to idle (RA mines). It also gets feature parity with our recent building render traits such as allowing to disable it when it is on low power.\n- I also found SeedsResources doing multiple expensive trait lookups every few ticks. This caches everything in the constructor to further improve performance.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5805","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5805/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5805/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5805/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5805","id":37051883,"number":5805,"title":"Mount Idaho Map","user":{"login":"MustaphaTR","id":7933210,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7933210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR","html_url":"https://github.com/MustaphaTR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-07-03T07:07:45Z","updated_at":"2014-07-03T12:27:44Z","closed_at":"2014-07-03T07:37:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/5805","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5805","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5805.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5805.patch"},"body":"This is a orginal Westwood Studios map.
