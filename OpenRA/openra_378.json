the official mods shipping with OpenRA might not need it, more than two weapon slots could be useful for several other mods (including one I'm working on).\n\nAfter Tertiary, I continued with Weapon4-9, as quaternary, quinary and so on are just asking for typos, much more difficult to remember and far less copy-paste-friendly.\n\nNOTE: I did test this, and it seems to work fine, but I'm not a programmer, this was done by copy-pasting + trial & error. I'm particularly unsure about the MathMax part, I have no idea whether it really works as intended.\n\nNOTE2: This feature would become more useful if someone could implement customizable per-turret graphics, so that Secondary and beyond can use different turret graphics instead of using copies of the first turret. That would allow a large ship to have a small machine gun turret, two large cannon turrets and a missile turret, for example. That's beyond my current abilities, though.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2783/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2782","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2782/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2782/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2782/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/2782","id":12106768,"number":2782,"title":"fix
