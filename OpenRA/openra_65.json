I believe now this was a mistake. Regardless of intent, players will likely look upon its vs moving targets to be faulty rather than a feature. Community feedback:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/openra/comments/55gx81/ballistic_submarines_aa_useless/\nhttp://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=82&p=298167#298167\nRange was lowered to simulate the Projectile:Bullet's effective hits vs close targets and Turn Rate was lowered to deal with visual targeting issues vs moving targets. All in all these compromises should probably be scrapped for the AA MissileSub's first release cycle.\n\nThe PR's changes are for the most part modelled after Frame Limiter's SubMissileAA which features a more familiar approach. http://resource.openra.net/maps/16243/ This will make the AA perform better vs YAKs/MiGs and overall more efficient with increased range + speed with a slightly lowered damage output. \n\nAlso, I raised the SubMissile (vs ground) angle just a tiny bit (120, up from 105) for visual sake (originally 165).\n\nAnother issue not brought up previously is wether the MissileSub should be able to use its AA and AG at the same time. Currently there's a  seperate reload time for both weapons. **Edit**: Apparently this is the case for all units in ORA. I hadn't noticed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12188","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12188/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12188/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12188/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12188","id":181761188,"number":12188,"title":"Add an \"unstable\" parameter to the [Desc] attribute.","user":{"login":"pchote","id":167819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/167819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote","html_url":"https://github.com/pchote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":68514002,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Documentation","name":"Documentation","color":"5319e7","default":false},{"id":6382420,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Idea/Wishlist","name":"Idea/Wishlist","color":"e102d8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Phrohdoh","id":4861023,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4861023?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh","html_url":"https://github.com/Phrohdoh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Phrohdoh","id":4861023,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4861023?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh","html_url":"https://github.com/Phrohdoh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phrohdoh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-10-07T20:31:02Z","updated_at":"2017-02-20T14:15:30Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"Our expectation for features to be complete and stable before merging them upstream makes life difficult for people who want to work on small parts of bigger features or for niche traits that we don't have test cases for in our default mods.\n\nI believe that we can improve this situation, without hurting the stability or maintainability of our default mods, by allowing trait fields or entire traits to be marked as unstable using `[Desc(\"foo\", unstable=true)]`.\n\nThese would be marked in the trait docs as unstable, indicating that modders should use these properties at their own risk.  We can then relax our review standards on these features, e.g. not requiring upgrade rules for incompatible changes, or allowing them to be merged with missing features or bugs if the benefits of the feature still outweigh the issues.\n\nThe main technical benefit comes from adding a `--disallow-unstable` flag to the `--check-yaml` utility command.  This would let us actively prevent unstable features from being accidentally or intentionally included in our shipping mods via the `make test` rule.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12188/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12187","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12187/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12187/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12187/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12187","id":181750850,"number":12187,"title":"TD tiberium silo, refinery explosion mechanic.","user":{"login":"AoAGeneral","id":7693928,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7693928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral","html_url":"https://github.com/AoAGeneral","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":21103452,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Balancing","name":"Balancing","color":"DDDDDD","default":false},{"id":6382420,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Idea/Wishlist","name":"Idea/Wishlist","color":"e102d8","default":false},{"id":33453175,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Tiberian%20Dawn","name":"Tiberian Dawn","color":"FFD700","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-10-07T19:35:34Z","updated_at":"2016-10-12T21:58:41Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is part of the major balance needed for TD on the economy side.
