In our current implementation we treat the shellmap music as a regular track and (based on user preferences) cycle between all the available songs or stop playing anything after the song has completed its first playthrough.  Even worse, if the player has the default RA content download (which only includes one track) then the main menu will loop Hell March - one of our least low-key ambient tracks!  We have similar problems with the Ion Storm ambient track in TS, and the end-game victory/loss tracks.\n\nA simple (and I believe the best) way to handle these cases is to introduce an `AmbientMusic` property on the `MusicPlaylist` trait.  If this is set, then it is looped (ignoring any player music preferences) as the default music choice.  If the file is defined but not present (music content not installed) then it should play nothing instead of selecting an alternative track.  Player selected music (and the InitialMusic trait property) take precident over the ambient music, but the ambient track should start again as soon as the regular playlist runs out of songs or is manually stopped in the music player.\n\nAmbient tracks should also be displayed slightly different in the music player: they show the name and progress in the bottom player, but the playback controls (play/pause/next/prev) should be disabled.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8745","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8745/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8745/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8745/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8745","id":95913617,"number":8745,"title":"Show an indicator when server is not responding","user":{"login":"deniz1a","id":6599106,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6599106?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a","html_url":"https://github.com/deniz1a","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382420,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Idea/Wishlist","name":"Idea/Wishlist","color":"e102d8","default":false},{"id":79474555,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Networking","name":"Networking","color":"0052cc","default":false},{"id":124120259,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/UI","name":"UI","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-07-19T12:47:00Z","updated_at":"2017-09-02T15:07:21Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"When server is not responding, lobby state is frozen without any indication.

we have like 4-5 traits which handle TargetTypes on actors.\nTargetableBuilding returns the cells\nTargetableUnit works on units\nand multiple subclasses of TargetableUnit, all working around the fact that an actor can have only one Targetable\\* trait.\n\nI honestly didn't really looked into the code much, but from what I saw, merging TargetableBuilding and TargetableUnit is possible (via moving the Building() check in the latter) and then instead of having TargetableAircraft etc, we could set up their source traits granting an upgrade to enable/disable targeting/affection. (Helicopter granting an upgrade at height 200 for example)\n\nThis will be important for the RA2 mod because at there unit-targeting could change on the fly (Temporal weapons made the target only affected by such, an already mindcontrolled unit cannot be remindcontrolled, IronCurtained units weren't attacked by the AI, units in-air (paradropped or flying) couldn't get targeted by strictly ground weapons, etc).\n\nThis would also render map scripting easier.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8724/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8723","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8723/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8723/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8723/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8723","id":95275070,"number":8723,"title":"Unselect badly damaged units / no ammo","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382420,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Idea/Wishlist","name":"Idea/Wishlist","color":"e102d8","default":false},{"id":124120259,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/UI","name":"UI","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-07-15T19:49:33Z","updated_at":"2015-07-15T20:47:52Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I thought it might be an idea that when a group of units is selected to have a key to unselect units in red health.
