adds two new traits (`Plug` and `Pluggable`) that act as a per-actor upgrade source to completement the existing `GlobalUpgradable`.  An ActorInfo with `PlugInfo` receives special handling by PlaceBuildingOrderGenerator in order to activate the specified upgrades on the `Pluggable` actor.  It is assumed that the plug actor will immediately remove itself from the world after it is placed.\n\nThese traits are used to implement the TS power plant, component tower, and ion cannon upgrades.  In order to support this upgrade toggling has been added to `AttackBase`, `DetectCloaked`, `WithMuzzleFlash`, `WithTurret`, `WithIdleOverlay`, `SupportPower`.\n\nThis currently replicates the original TS upgrade behaviour, which does not support production limits (yes, you can indeed place two ion cannon nodes on the upgrade center in the original game).  I plan on adding support for this in the future by making the `Pluggable` actor hold a reference to the `Plug`, but our production limit code is full of bugs that stop this from working right now (you can see some of these issues by putting tanya in an APC in RA) so i've deferred that until the TechTree code gets its long-planned rework.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7812/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7811","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7811/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7811/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7811/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7811","id":65540716,"number":7811,"title":"Added two new BlendModes","user":{"login":"reaperrr","id":2857877,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2857877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperrr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2015-03-31T20:40:38Z","updated_at":"2015-07-16T22:46:00Z","closed_at":"2015-04-03T09:57:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/7811","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7811","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7811.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7811.patch"},"body":"And used them to improve D2k effect visuals.\n\nMost notably this one (left is bleed, right is new BlendMode):\n![new-blendmode1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2857877/6928807/df905b5c-d7f6-11e4-9ec6-140a2dfe75be.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7811/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7810","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7810/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7810/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7810/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7810","id":65540317,"number":7810,"title":"Spectator slots block people from joining the game","user":{"login":"AoAGeneral","id":7693928,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7693928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral","html_url":"https://github.com/AoAGeneral","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382400,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"d7e102","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2015-03-31T20:38:23Z","updated_at":"2017-05-20T11:50:54Z","closed_at":"2017-05-20T11:50:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In CNC95 I have recently come across a strange glitch.\n\nWhen people go into the spectator slot some players cannot join until the spectators are kicked.
