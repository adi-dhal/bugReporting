siege tank had a rotating turret for a while, but now it's back to only firing straight. The argument against this behaviour is that the siege tank was useful vs. quads and raider trikes. In particular, it now won't stand a chance vs. stealth raider trikes, who will blast them to pieces before they can get a shot off. When turreted, it can quickly aim and maybe damage or kill before it's destroyed. As it stands, it probably won't be able to react fast enough to be terribly useful. \n\nIt was intended to be a reasonable (but not impervious) counter to light vehicles. It was also intended to be able to fire and move at the same time, to make up for its low hitpoints and modest range. It also differentiates it from the longer-range rocket launcher which fires straight. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4388/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4387","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4387/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4387/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4387/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4387","id":24848372,"number":4387,"title":"-","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382420,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Idea/Wishlist","name":"Idea/Wishlist","color":"e102d8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-12-28T17:03:30Z","updated_at":"2014-01-12T01:09:44Z","closed_at":"2014-01-12T01:09:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4387/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4386","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4386/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4386/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4386/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/4386","id":24847455,"number":4386,"title":"Ported first GDI mission to Lua","user":{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2013-12-28T15:53:57Z","updated_at":"2014-06-13T18:01:32Z","closed_at":"2013-12-31T03:19:25Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/4386","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/4386","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/4386.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/4386.patch"},"body":"my first attempts with the in-game Lua scripts.
