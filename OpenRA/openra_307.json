always thought it might be neat if soviets had a submarine that was a infantry transport.\nPops up when its on a shore tile so it can unload.\nOn that note I think regular transports should go up onto shore tiles to unload, like in Warcraft. That way units have more cells to exit onto.\n\nGive soviets a flak boat so they can defend against aircraft over water? Give missile subs a secondary anti-air missile?\n\nGive YAK's a single torpedo? Can only be used against things in the water.\n(Still the glaring problem of water being near impossible to retake once a player has control of it.)\n\nWould be cool if you could tell helicopters to land anywhere so you can repair them with a mechanic in the field. Understandable that planes can't land anywhere.\n\nMake the got' dang badger buildable already, I tried but the game hates me and just crashes.\n-Slow speed\n-High cost ($2500?)\n-Good damage, easily takes out a adv. power plant, but not a war factory.\n-High health (Should be able to penetrate light to moderate anti-air zones and make it back.)\n(-Build limit of 2?)\n-Bombs should not have parachutes, you can sell buildings in the time it takes them to land.\n\nYou could also load it up with infantry while its sitting at the airfield and it will drop them instead! \n\nI know graphics for tank-traps already exist in the game. They should block vehicles but allow infantry to pass freely. Take a lot of damage but go down easily with engineers. Unless this is how they work already? \n\nGive engineers \"light C4\"\n-Cant insta-kill buildings \n-Can take out walls, bridges, tank traps.\n-All C4's should take out the directly adjacent pieces of wall making using a engineer/Tonya to take out wall a good strategy.\n\nAircraft should reload slowly in the air, but if they come to a helipad/airfield they reload as they do now which is pretty fast.\n\nNew play test when?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4925/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4924","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4924/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4924/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4924/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/4924","id":29806567,"number":4924,"title":"Reduce range of Recon Bikes, Bazookas","user":{"login":"psydev","id":1637812,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1637812?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev","html_url":"https://github.com/psydev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-03-20T10:10:19Z","updated_at":"2014-06-26T04:12:41Z","closed_at":"2014-03-23T01:21:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/4924","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/4924","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/4924.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/4924.patch"},"body":"Guard tower had its range reduced from 6 -> 5.

Original Chronotank order generator was cleaned up (still exists).\n- Added an order targeter to Chronotank which allows players to hold `Shift` or `Alt` and issue a move order to teleport (multiple tanks selected means group teleportation).\n- Updated the Teleport activity to pick the next best destination cell if the target location is invalid (bad terrain type, already occupied, or out of range). This applies to ctnk teleports and the chronosphere return trip only. However there are some limitations of Teleport due to `WorldUtils.MaxRange`.\n  - Modders cannot specify a `MaxDistance` greater than 50 for ctnk, however they can remove the limit altogether with `HasDistanceLimit: false`. An exception is thrown if modders try to do this (with a helpful message).\n  - When searching for the destination teleport cell, another radius search for valid cells is done. If no appropriate cells are found within radius (before `MaxDistance` or `WorldUtils.MaxRange`, whatever comes first), the unit won't teleport. This is only a problem on the return chronosphere trip, and that would literally require a radius of 50 cells that are invalid from the original chrono destination.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4918/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4917","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4917/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4917/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4917/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4917","id":29739192,"number":4917,"title":"Dune 2000 Carryall Desync","user":{"login":"Sircrashalot","id":6817911,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6817911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sircrashalot","html_url":"https://github.com/Sircrashalot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sircrashalot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sircrashalot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sircrashalot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sircrashalot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sircrashalot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sircrashalot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sircrashalot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sircrashalot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sircrashalot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382357,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Crash","name":"Crash","color":"e10c02","default":false},{"id":21104921,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Dune%202000","name":"Dune 2000","color":"EDC9AF","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":12,"created_at":"2014-03-19T14:59:52Z","updated_at":"2014-12-07T11:21:48Z","closed_at":"2014-12-07T11:21:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"```\nDune 2000 Revision Mod at Version test build 19032014\nOperating System: Windows (Microsoft Windows NT 6.1.7601 Service Pack 1)\nRuntime Version: .NET CLR 2.0.50727.5477\nException of type `System.InvalidOperationException`: Out of sync in frame 4333: Blame Tick.\n Compare syncreport.log with other players.\n   bei OpenRA.Network.OrderManager.OutOfSync(Int32 frame, String blame)\n   bei OpenRA.Network.OrderManager.CheckSync(Byte[] packet)\n   bei OpenRA.Network.OrderManager.<TickImmediate>c__AnonStorey13.<>m__4(Int32 clientId, Byte[] packet)\n   bei OpenRA.Network.ReplayRecorderConnection.<Receive>c__AnonStorey1B.<>m__12(Int32 client, Byte[] data)\n   bei OpenRA.Network.EchoConnection.Receive(Action`2 packetFn)\n   bei OpenRA.Network.ReplayRecorderConnection.Receive(Action`2 packetFn)\n   bei OpenRA.Network.OrderManager.TickImmediate()\n   bei OpenRA.Sync.<CheckSyncUnchanged>c__AnonStorey35.<>m__6A()\n   bei OpenRA.Sync.CheckSyncUnchanged[T](World world, Func`1 fn)\n   bei OpenRA.Sync.CheckSyncUnchanged(World world, Action fn)\n   bei OpenRA.Game.TickInner(OrderManager orderManager)\n   bei OpenRA.Game.Tick(OrderManager orderManager)\n   bei OpenRA.Game.Run()\n   bei OpenRA.Program.Run(String[] args)\n   bei OpenRA.Program.Main(String[] args)\n```\n\nWhat happend here?
