believe that #10113 is the incorrect fix.

Those that can attack go running after the target. Those that can't, remain idle.

sound engine parameter was added for three main reasons, which are all now invalid:\n- To allow dedicated servers to run headless (no longer needed thanks to the overhaul in the last release)\n- As an automatic fallback if OpenAL can't be initialized (broken somewhere between release-20150919 and release-20151224)\n- As a way for people to completely mute audio (we now have a mute checkbox)\n\nThese plus #11252 (game crashes on launch if the \"Output Disabled\" option is selected in release-20160508) convinced me that this feature has outlived its usefulness and should be removed.\n\nI also used this chance to clean up the platform initialization in general.\n\nFixes
