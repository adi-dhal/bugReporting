introduces a new scripting API built on [Eluant](https://github.com/cdhowie/Eluant) and the native lua library.  The main focus of this implementation was building a self-consistent and self-documenting API (generated using the  `--lua-docs` utility command, and available [on the wiki](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/New-Lua-API)).  Secondary benefits are that it is faster than Kopilua and doesn't leak memory everywhere.\n\nThis is going to take a while to properly review, so i'm filing this now. There ~~are two~~ is one main TODOs left to finish:\n- ~~Packaging changes: we can use the system lua for linux platforms, but will need to ship lua on Windows and OSX. We should also credit the new thirdparty bits in AUTHORS.~~\n- ~~Eluant.dll includes a bunch of now-redundant changes. I need to create a public fork, revert the changes we don't need, and file upstream prs for the ones that we do.~~\n\nThis implements enough of the API for the shellmaps, but no more.  A future PR will introduce a `ScriptPlayerProperties` implementation that exposes mission objectives and victory conditions.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5190/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5189","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5189/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5189/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5189/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5189","id":32193379,"number":5189,"title":"Added \"Capture-the\" Flag","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-04-24T22:52:53Z","updated_at":"2014-11-01T16:27:58Z","closed_at":"2014-04-26T10:23:56Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/5189","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5189","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5189.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5189.patch"},"body":"![kl9jxbk](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1997864/2795984/6bbc96dc-cc03-11e3-8d25-a1965eed236b.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5188","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5188/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5188/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5188/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5188","id":32178521,"number":5188,"title":"Fix build palette showing too many queued items when BuildLimit is reached","user":{"login":"obrakmann","id":4331210,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4331210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann","html_url":"https://github.com/obrakmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-04-24T19:33:45Z","updated_at":"2014-06-25T16:28:25Z","closed_at":"2014-04-27T00:52:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/5188","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5188","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5188.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5188.patch"},"body":"When a BuildLimit on an actor type is set and nearly reached, you could\nshift-click the build palette and it would show it had five more units\nqueued when really less are allowed to be built.
