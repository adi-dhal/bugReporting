#8197 (disclaimer: untested).\n\nThe voxel renderer creates unbuffered sheets but still allocates sprites over them. This unusual use case caused the sheet builder to fall over as it always assumed buffered sheets would be created and thus need releasing.\n\nUltimately, releasing the buffer if the sheet is unbuffered is not a problem. You only need to get the exception when calling CommitData as that assumes you were writing to the buffer and now want that buffer committed to texture. If you try and commit and there was no buffer, that's a logic error you want to know about.\n- If you call ReleaseBuffer and the buffer is already released, this now is a no-op rather than an exception.\n- I have renamed CommitData to CommitBufferedData for a bit of extra clarity. This remains an exception if called when there is no buffer.\n- The junk code doing some thread-safety in Sheet has been removed. It is not needed as the only cross-thread call was removed in #8103 because the thread-safety was half-baked anyway.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8199","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8199/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8199/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8199/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8199","id":78619635,"number":8199,"title":"added
