Here is the install.log\r\n\r\n```\r\nCopying F:\\.\\CONQUER.MIX -> C:\\Users\\Brandon\\Documents\\OpenRA\\Content/cnc/conquer.mix\r\nCopying F:\\.\\DESERT.MIX -> C:\\Users\\Brandon\\Documents\\OpenRA\\Content/cnc/desert.mix\r\nCopying F:\\.\\GENERAL.MIX -> C:\\Users\\Brandon\\Documents\\OpenRA\\Content/cnc/general.mix\r\nCopying F:\\.\\SCORES.MIX -> C:\\Users\\Brandon\\Documents\\OpenRA\\Content/cnc/scores.mix\r\nCopying F:\\.\\SOUNDS.MIX -> C:\\Users\\Brandon\\Documents\\OpenRA\\Content/cnc/sounds.mix\r\nCopying F:\\.\\TEMPERAT.MIX -> C:\\Users\\Brandon\\Documents\\OpenRA\\Content/cnc/temperat.mix\r\nCopying F:\\.\\WINTER.MIX -> C:\\Users\\Brandon\\Documents\\OpenRA\\Content/cnc/winter.mix\r\nExtracting F:\\INSTALL/SETUP.Z -> C:\\Users\\Brandon\\Documents\\OpenRA\\Content/cnc/speech.mix\r\nSystem.IO.InvalidDataException: Invalid dictionary size\r\n   at OpenRA.FileFormats.Blast.Decompress(Stream input, Stream output, Action`2 onProgress)\r\n   at OpenRA.Mods.Common.Widgets.Logic.InstallFromDiscLogic.ExtractFromPackage(ExtractionType type, String path, MiniYaml actionYaml, List`1 extractedFiles, Action`1 updateMessage)\r\n   at OpenRA.Mods.Common.Widgets.Logic.InstallFromDiscLogic.<InstallFromDisc>c__AnonStorey5.<>m__1()\r\nDeleting C:\\Users\\Brandon\\Documents\\OpenRA\\Content/cnc/conquer.mix\r\nDeleting C:\\Users\\Brandon\\Documents\\OpenRA\\Content/cnc/desert.mix\r\nDeleting C:\\Users\\Brandon\\Documents\\OpenRA\\Content/cnc/general.mix\r\nDeleting C:\\Users\\Brandon\\Documents\\OpenRA\\Content/cnc/scores.mix\r\nDeleting C:\\Users\\Brandon\\Documents\\OpenRA\\Content/cnc/sounds.mix\r\nDeleting C:\\Users\\Brandon\\Documents\\OpenRA\\Content/cnc/temperat.mix\r\nDeleting C:\\Users\\Brandon\\Documents\\OpenRA\\Content/cnc/winter.mix\r\nDeleting C:\\Users\\Brandon\\Documents\\OpenRA\\Content/cnc/speech.mix\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried Googling the error in the log and didn't find anything relevant. I am using OpenRA 20170527 on Windows 10 15063.483 64-bit.  The discs are US English discs. Both the front cover of the jewel case and the discs say Windows 95 under the Command & Conquer logo if that means something.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13688","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13688/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13688/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13688/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13688","id":244855312,"number":13688,"title":"TransformOnCapture

For individual delays modders will have to define the whole list of delays (i.e. if `Burst: 6` where delay between 2nd and 3rd and 4th & 5th should be 10 and 5 between all other bursts, it would have to be `BurstDelays: 5, 10, 5, 10, 5`).\r\nFor convenience, if only a single value is defined it will be used for all bursts.\r\n\r\nI have a branch for this, but it's based and therefore depends on

combined with the other damage tweaks I previously made - just might be enough already.\r\n\r\nI was able to kill two artilleries in a row with some quick clicking on the 2nd.\r\n\r\nThis might need further fine-tuning of course, but by no longer sticking to 100%-RA1 style strafing, balancing this properly should be doable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13677/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13676","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13676/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13676/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13676/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13676","id":244791713,"number":13676,"title":"Setting to disable the command bar (visually)","user":{"login":"abcdefg30","id":7704140,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7704140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30","html_url":"https://github.com/abcdefg30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33149887,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Polish","name":"Polish","color":"FF9933","default":false},{"id":124120259,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/UI","name":"UI","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/23/labels","id":2556950,"number":23,"title":"Next Release","description":"","creator":{"login":"reaperrr","id":2857877,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2857877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperrr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2,"closed_issues":231,"state":"open","created_at":"2017-06-01T19:00:24Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T20:57:42Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-07-21T21:49:10Z","updated_at":"2017-07-26T19:32:55Z","closed_at":"2017-07-26T19:32:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"As requested on Discord.

players often get confused about what is happening in the battlefield, and old players that have little or no tolerance left will 70% get mad at them, because some things like kill an enemy engineer that is capturing your construction yard is just to obvious for them, but not for a new player.\r\n\r\nAlso new players might get frustrated by the RTS idea, examples will be: like \"what to do with the car in the start\" and \"ore? tiberium??? whats all this?\" ect.\r\n\r\nI strongly believe that in order to keep new players in the game we will need a 4 stage tutorial.\r\n\r\nStage 1:  map 1\r\nFundamentals of rts gaming, what is a base building, why we need units, how the resource management works, or even how we win the game.\r\n\r\nStage 2: map 1\r\nLearn how to build and what to build, read the descriptions of each unit and building, use of super weapons, gather this amount of resources, use of the radar, complete minor objectives, expand your base, learn the usage of some units and buildings and how to use them when its needed, ect.\r\n\r\nStage 3: map 2\r\nUse what you learn vs Bot, allow the player to recover via scripts (money gift, reinforcements, ect) \r\nguide him to use advance tactics like use of artillery type units with a combination of air units,  use iron curtain with shock troopers, use chrono on tanks vs the enemy base and mechanics to repair them after they return back, help your AI ally with defenses and money trucks and repair his buildings.\r\n\r\nStage 4: map 2\r\nMultiplayer interaction, beacons, chat short messages (cap=capture, AA=build allied anti air defense here), assist other players, sent money, plan ahead with your ally, be aware of notifications on mini map, combine your forces with your ally forces, be aggressive (don't fear that your enemy has 10 tesla coils on his base, go get that oil derrick that is way far from your base).\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso using a voice tutorial will assist on keeping the player interested on staying, \r\nobjectives could be announced once with a voice notification and continue to notify the player with text notifications at repeated rates.\r\n\r\nProviding the player with the link of https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Playing-the-game at the end of each tutorial will also be a good idea.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13671/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4985","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"CD7A:572A:6F30CB:FA5F46:59D6B263","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=16>;
