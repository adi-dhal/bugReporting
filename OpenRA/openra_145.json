It appears as a kind of black cloud throwing Tesla thunders. Maybe because It was tough to render on the PS1 ?\n\nIf it can help, I'd do a capture of this to show you.\n\nAlso for the PS1, the Vortex used to disappear after a random time. And not always attack units.\n\nFor the PC version it seems It always attack and never disappears.\n\nBoth PS1 and PC version may appear randomnly around the map after chronoshift use.\n\nAs far as I remember PS1 version is less powerful.\n\nSo maybe the vortex feature can be created based on the PS1 version instead of the PC version ?\n\nRegards.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this
