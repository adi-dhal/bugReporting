This is really nice from a logic POV as it implies the game settings being absolutely flexible but clutters the UI and doesn't scale well when it comes to multiple mods.\n\nA better implementation would be what UT2004 did - http://i330.photobucket.com/albums/l422/kassulke29/ScreenShot001.jpg - , having a fifth tab in the lobby screen where players could enable/disable these mutators instead of having dozens of checkboxes.\n\nSettings like destructible bridges or harvester immunity would be a great example to be restored this way.
