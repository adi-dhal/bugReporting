the button of an active tab is clicked, the whole production window slides off and becomes hidden. This is annoying if it is accidentally clicked and you have to move the cursor to the new position of the tab button. I think there should be a separate hide/show button for this purpose and the tab buttons shouldn't hide the window. Here is a crude mock up of how it could look like:\n\n![hide_tabs](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6599106/2559155/51698722-b76d-11e3-85c5-1d9bdcd26b2a.png)\n\nThis has the advantage that the hide/show button doesn't change positions but this could also lead to mis-clicks while trying to click the top right element in the production tab. Maybe this function could be removed entirely?\n\n<bountysource-plugin>\n\n---\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Place a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/1450324-add-a-separate-button-to-hide-show-production-window?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4982/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4981","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4981/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4981/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4981/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4981","id":30447481,"number":4981,"title":"Debug menu has different names","user":{"login":"deniz1a","id":6599106,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6599106?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a","html_url":"https://github.com/deniz1a","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33149887,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Polish","name":"Polish","color":"FF9933","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-03-29T16:53:27Z","updated_at":"2014-03-29T17:12:03Z","closed_at":"2014-03-29T17:01:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In lobby options it is called \"Debug Menu\", on the in-game menu button it is called \"Cheats\" and the actual menu window has the title \"Developer Mode\".
