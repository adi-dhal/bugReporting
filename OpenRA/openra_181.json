servers run the release and your playtest installer will have overwritten the registry, so the playtest version should run). Doesn't matter.\n **3.** Connected or not, go to the modchooser.\n **4.** You will get a nice exception:\n\n> Exception of type `System.IO.FileNotFoundException`: File not found: ./mods/modchooser/chrome.png\n\n **5.** Build OpenRA with the provided patch and replace the playtest's exe (`OpenRA.exe`).\n**6.** Repeat steps **1**-**3**. Now you should be able to switch mods at will.\n\n**P.S.:** Or use the installer @obrakmann provided in
