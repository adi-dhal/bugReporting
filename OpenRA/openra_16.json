With the UnitStance the Barracks loses an additional role as a damage soaker so I thought of hold of the change but the reward of putting a dent on to the infantry production makes the change worth doing still.\r\n\r\nThe War Factory cap being the most intriguing change of the two was introduced to the v1.6 playtest series right off the bat as a 'work or die' feature that after hundreds of games ended up as a background feature - meaning it doesn't really add to the game until mid-late game or in big team games. Initially players attempted to take advantage of the 2nd War Factory reducing production time early by 25% in order to execute new aggressive strategies, however quickly faded as the expansion and tech route inevitable dominated it. The super fast tank/vehicle rushes (e.g. 9 second Light Tanks with 4 WF's!) just don't happen. Thus it ended up as a feature I initially hoped for, although less prevalent, as an option later in the game that expands the range of strategies.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that the $2000 War Factory never really gets to have its production time for its units decreased as its pricing makes additional structures very low priority throughout all matches. This is not the case for all other production queues including building production where the MCV production despite being expensive, is well integrated in the meta and part of just about every strategy. As for the reduction values themselves they're really just the 1st,3rd,5th,7th value of the original 7-steps reduction values for the rest of the production decrease.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13669/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13668","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13668/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13668/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13668/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13668","id":244364776,"number":13668,"title":"Add

it was merged and some shortly after, we're now at @abcdefg30 , @FrameLimiter and @SoScared for voices of (rather strong) concern, so the probability of more complaints and a push to revert it once the playtest is out is extremely high.\r\n\r\nIn a pre-emptive strike for that, it's probably better to just let it go and drop it before that happens, to save some nerves and time.\r\n\r\nThe functionality remains, so we can still consider using it for single-player missions at some point, and modders have the option to use it for maps and mods as well, that's good enough.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13651/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13650","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13650/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13650/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13650/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13650","id":243522670,"number":13650,"title":"Fix
