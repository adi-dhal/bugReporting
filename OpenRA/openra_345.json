almost every command and conquer game the tanks always pointed their turrets towards their target, it diden't mather if they were attacking or moving.\n\nThis should be added ingame as this can actully be used as way to detecte where someone would attack in advance, as such you would need to move smaller distances rather then to attack from one point of the map to the other to avoid getting your plans detected.\n\nAs a bonus we should also add so that tank turrets turn randomly (But not to much) when idling, so they face diffrentently... i remember RA3 using this, they only made so that the turret would turn 15 degrees or so from one side or the other every now and then, not enough to make it annoying, but just enough so it wont get boring.\n\n<bountysource-plugin>\n\n---\n\nWant to

A unit should be able to spawn a child unit that attacks the target for the master unit, if child gets destroyed, it will be automatically replaced after a set amount of time.\n\nExample. Red Alert 2 - Allied Destroyer - It has a main gun to bombard coastal target, and a Osprey Helicopter docked in the rear that will lift of and bomb enemy subs.\n\nExample 2. Red Alert 2 - Allied Carrier - It's a ship that launches 3 fighters that attacks a target from very long range. If a fighter gets shot down, it will replace it after a set amount of time.\n\nIt would be even better if you could set it so that it either replace units auto. or that the player need to pay to replace the unit (might be hard to code in)\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on
