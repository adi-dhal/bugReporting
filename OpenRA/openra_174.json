the current cell strength and the neighboring state (very similar to `D2KResourceLayer`).\r\n  - Include a method for reducing the strength at a given cell.  If strength falls below 0 then remove the custom terrain type from the cell (allowing it to revert to \"water\").\r\n  - Grow the ice using similar logic to our resource spawners: Every [configurable interval] increase the strength of [one or more] ice cell(s) that are either adjacent to another ice tile or adjacent to the shore.\r\n- Add a new `DamagesIce` trait that lives on actors.\r\n  - Each tick, check if the actor is on an ice tile.  If it is, reduce its strength.  If the the actor is no longer allowed in the cell after the damage is applied (i.e. it has broken the tile, but decoupled using the existing plumbing provided by terrain types and `Mobile`) then kill it with a special warhead that includes a damage type that triggers the spash death effect.\r\n- Add a new `DamagesIce` warhead type.\r\n  - This reduces strength of any ice tiles in the damage area.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8918/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8917","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8917/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8917/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8917/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8917","id":98797059,"number":8917,"title":"Support high bridges in TS","user":{"login":"pchote","id":167819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/167819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote","html_url":"https://github.com/pchote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382407,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"02d7e1","default":false},{"id":41025558,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Tiberian%20Sun","name":"Tiberian Sun","color":"eb6420","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-08-03T17:19:12Z","updated_at":"2016-11-10T20:36:31Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"These are trickier than ground-level bridges because they exist in their own movement layer and allow units to go both over and under them (but not drive off the sides).\r\n\r\nThey share some similarities with tunnels [#6410], but are more complicated because the bridge must be treated as a proper layer of cells instead of being a wormhole connecting two points in the map.\r\n\r\nIf the pathfinder explicitly tracked the connections between cells then the bridges can insert connections into their own separate cell layer for pathfinding and the ActorMap.
