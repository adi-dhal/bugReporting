https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7006 's idea, I think that official messages displayed in the _Battlefields News dropdown menu_ should be translated into the player's OS language. This would make the message have more impact on the player and catch his/her attention. \n\nNote that not all news should be translated, but only the ones for Releases (and perhaps Playtests too?). Indeed, it would be hard to ask for translations for every message posted in this _Battlefield News dropdown menu_.\n\nHere is an example of text that woud need to be translated:\n\n> We are happy to announce a new stable release of OpenRA. Head over to our website at http://openra.net to see the full announcement, and take a look at the full changelog at http://changelog.openra.net to get an impression of all the changes. We wish you a lot of fun with this new release!\n\nTodo: \n- [ ] make OpenRA detect the player's OS language (if not already)\n- [ ] ask volunteers for translations (with time, I am sure contributors from foreign countries will send us their translations)\n- [ ] Display first the translated message, then, below it, the original message in English.\n\n![battlefieldnews_translation](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1732773/19619279/b09d8eb2-9863-11e6-85f7-d4bf784ab490.gif)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12280","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12280/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12280/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12280/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12280","id":184610641,"number":12280,"title":"Rebinding

found out that you can load ANY tank type into choppers, Phase tanks, APC's, rangers, just by using a simple trick. Normally you should only be able to do this in a naval transport, But i found out that by selecting an over-amount of units that the transports u have at the shoreline which the naval transports can hol, using the Alt-shift combination on 2 naval transports(so thats 10 tanks of any kind, And besides that you can remove the second naval transport before units reach them to load themselves in), In combination with ANY other transport unit like a chopper, phase transport, apc, or a ranger, setup close to the same shoreline will make the tankgroup which is left after the naval transport is fully loaded, load into the other transport units that are placed close to the same shoreline. I tested this over and over in single player and multiplayer. And it works. You can basicly make a chinook drop with 16 artilleries behind the enemy base without any trouble. which is much faster and than a chronoshift, and lasts indefinately. and the amount can be stacked as high as you want to. I really think this is a bug that needs to be fixed.
