glitch is hard to pull off but here it is:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/S4kc_d4OW4Y\r\n\r\n* Normally when you order a full harvester to mine ore, it will return to the refinery.\r\n* However, if you move the ore truck to where it unloads then order it to mine ore, it tries to reach the refinery but will not unload. (Being already there at the docking position causes the bug)\r\n\r\nNot usually a problem but when you try to mod and try to make \"Marv\", which virtually \"dock\" by skipping drop-off location check, you get to skip the follwing SequenceActivities() call:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nDeliverResources.cs:Tick()\r\n\r\n\t\tif (self.Location !=  proc.Location + iao.DeliveryOffset)\r\n\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\tvar notify = self.TraitsImplementing<INotifyHarvesterAction>();\r\n\t\t\t\t\tforeach (var n in notify)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tn.MovingToRefinery(self, dest, this);\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\treturn ActivityUtils.SequenceActivities(movement.MoveTo(dest, 0), this);\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you get to skip this SequenceActivities(), you get the glitch shown as the video above.\r\n\r\nWhy are all the actions queued by iao.OnDock() not working if SequenceActivities is skipped?\r\nWhat does SequenceActivities do? Not too sure as it has no comments in the code or documentation.\r\n\r\nI am 99% sure it is SequenceActivities.\r\nWhen I replace the if condition in the above code to something else (such ase actor's facing) and let the actor turn its facing with return ActivityUtils.SequenceActivities(new Turn(self, 0), this); you get no problem.

dock)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12715/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12714","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12714/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12714/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12714/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12714","id":205508493,"number":12714,"title":"Crash
