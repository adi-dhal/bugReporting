This is why most maps often look like \n\nthis\n![engagement orig](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2715583/14581528/aee3867a-03ef-11e6-80a3-66bfd56957a5.png)\n\ninstead of this\n![engagement rew](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2715583/14581530/b23dd302-03ef-11e6-8dc7-11b9103ec719.png)\n\n*edit: the bug seem to appear when editing existing maps, removing and re-placing player spawns. In  order to reproduce the bug with a new map you need to save it, exit the editor, re-open the map and replace the player spawns with new player spawns.\n\nThe scrambling sort of defeats the purpose of having lettered positions in the lobby. In the editor I'm currently solving this by placing player spawns one by one,  _save and quit the map_ and reopen the map after each one,  until I have them all there.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11124","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11124/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11124/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11124/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11124","id":148772790,"number":11124,"title":"Add tileset depth metadata support.","user":{"login":"pchote","id":167819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/167819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote","html_url":"https://github.com/pchote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-04-15T21:24:22Z","updated_at":"2016-04-21T21:00:58Z","closed_at":"2016-04-21T20:59:42Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/11124","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11124","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11124.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11124.patch"},"body":"This adds support for per-tile Z-ramp and Z-offsets to the tileset code and gen2 tileset importer.  The TS tilesets are reimported with proper values.\n\nThe defaults are set up so that tiles without any extra depth metadata will be \"flat\" at ground level – the test commit enables this in RA for illustration.  The TS tilesets are set up so that tile tile depths are correctly zeroed at the middle of the tile.\n\nThe expected behaviour is (for mods with `EnableDepth: true`) for sprite data to be cut off for all y < CenterPosition.Y, because for flat sprites with Z = CenterPosition.Z anything lower is rendered behind the terrain.  A future PR that adds support for sprite depth maps will fix that.  This puts the ground work in place by setting the correct terrain depth.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11124/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11123","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11123/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11123/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11123/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11123","id":148741601,"number":11123,"title":"[TS]
