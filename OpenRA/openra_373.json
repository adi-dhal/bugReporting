For Cloak.cs and InvisibleToEnemy.cs I still provide a backfall to World.LocalPlayer if Shroud is null. Don't know if this is still required.\n\nThere are some other minor glitches left because #2759 is incomplete. Ranks are rendered even when the unit is HiddenUnderFog in spectator mode. The same applies for the rank-up and cash tick effect as well as building animations.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2949","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2949/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2949/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2949/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2949","id":12798544,"number":2949,"title":"Gap Generator and friends should stop spinning when low on power","user":{"login":"ScottNZ","id":1712619,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1712619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScottNZ","html_url":"https://github.com/ScottNZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScottNZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScottNZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScottNZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScottNZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScottNZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScottNZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScottNZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScottNZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScottNZ/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382407,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"02d7e1","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-04-04T12:56:14Z","updated_at":"2014-04-20T12:59:47Z","closed_at":"2014-04-20T12:59:45Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2948","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2948/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2948/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2948/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/2948","id":12794999,"number":2948,"title":"balance stick -
