The latter would have the highest compatibility with image editing programs, though.\n\nOutside the legacy mods this would make things so much easier, IMO. OS SHP Builder still has a buggy(shp TS)/broken(shp TD) saving mechanism, and converting back and forth between PNG and SHP/TMP via XCC or command line is annoying as heck. To be able to just drop your edited PNG with its own palette into the bits folder and be done with it would be so much more convenient, and save modders tons of time.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/1533521-add-support-for-using-8-bit-pngs-instead-of-shps?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5075/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5074","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5074/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5074/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5074/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5074","id":31019400,"number":5074,"title":"Chronotank, its worthless.","user":{"login":"epicelite","id":2596563,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2596563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epicelite","html_url":"https://github.com/epicelite","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epicelite/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epicelite/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epicelite/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epicelite/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epicelite/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epicelite/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epicelite/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epicelite/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epicelite/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":21103452,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Balancing","name":"Balancing","color":"DDDDDD","default":false},{"id":21877809,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Red%20Alert","name":"Red Alert","color":"8B0000","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-04-07T20:32:43Z","updated_at":"2014-12-28T15:30:46Z","closed_at":"2014-12-28T15:30:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Its weak, its weapon isn't anything special, and it doesn't even have enough range to chrono past base defenses. \n\nHow do we make it more valuable?
