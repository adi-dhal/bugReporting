the idea of balance teams for the moment, one specific solution involves adding a wiki section on game balance PRs that presents some guidelines and/or prerequisites for a solid balance PR. \n\nNote that this wouldn't necessary _exclude_ balance PR's (including fixes affecting balance) that don't follow these guidelines, as done in the past, but rather include those that are prepared below the radar of frequent GitHub contributors. Also since different mods are in different development stages this entry could be added onto feature-complete mods:\n https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Development-Goals#tiberian-dawn-and-red-alert \n\nThe wiki entry could allow PR authors, contributors and developers to be better equipped taking on balance PRs that's based more on activity outside the sphere of GitHub and Sleipnir's forum.\n\nGuidelines/prerequisite standards ought to include:\n1. Sourcing relevant opinions (fully excluding anonymous polls) and/or discussions.\n2. Sourcing playtesting and evaluation, all done by a recognized group of players.\n3. All stages sourced must have been open to the public and fully transparent during the process.\n\nContributors could then evaluate certain balance PRs on the quality of the authors sourced homework, thus forcing discussions topics on to elements not covered directly with the prerequisites. This would also unload a chunk of work upon the PR author and streamline the process in such a way that contributors/developers dont have to spend extra time researching claims presented in the PR.\n\nIn turn this could encourage the community to involve itself more in the development process, especially testing out new ideas and creative solutions knowing that if it proves to add value to the game it has a chance of making its way to a fair evaluation.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12013/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12012","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12012/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12012/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12012/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12012","id":176233756,"number":12012,"title":"TD:

the Mammoth Tank buff suggestion in #11731 I'd planned to bring along a series of balance PR's but was stalled due to the miscalculation on my part on how balance PR's was evaluated on GitHub. I honestly believed that this particular PR would be merged within hours due to the initial comment pointing to balance discussions among many of OpenRA's most invested players, the series of recorded map playtests and widely distributed map downloads (thousands!) over the course of 4 months with the particular balance change involved. Naturally I didn't expect everyone to agree on the PR itself but the sheer volume of support behind the balance change (compared to anything else noted in the changelog history) led me to believe that regardless of whatever gobbledygook it would meet in the comments in terms of impact on gameplay and balance it would be merged into the bleed like a magnet.\n\nFirst, just to put this issue dead once and for all, despite mentioned in #11731 **5 times**, there's little-to-nothing in terms of balance changes in this playtest for the RA mod. The artillery nerf and late tech air buff effects has to some degree already been mapped out, demonstrated for months with the map playtests mentioned above including Frame Limiters own extensive map playtesting. With the exception of faster aircraft rearmament there's little else of effect on gameplay we should expect from the couple of weeks that the official playtest will be running. Ore harvester self-healing is a minor tweak and faction neutral. Transport accessibility to beach tiles has been improved, Nuke Truck damage vs air nerfed. GPS down with Tech Center and/or Radar Dome powerdown. Minor tweaks - improves gameplay with specific scenarios, not overall gameplay. \n\nUnfortunately I was a bit preoccupied and came up short in the comment section of the Mammoth PR which was the reason why I put up the forum poll thread, knowing it was gonna be a landslide. Personally I'm not a big fan of forum polls when it comes to balance discussions but with the PR being unreasonably sandbagged I just didn't care at that point.\n\nI know there's been discussions among the devs on establishing balance teams for the RA mod in order to avoid cases such as this but I feel that it ought not be necessary. With exception to the TD mod the great majority of power players has little to nothing to do with GitHub and for the most part leave the forum's balance discussions alone. They _do_ play a ton of games tho and when they do voice their opinions it should carry real weight. Their reasoning may not always be substantiated by long posts but when there's an unmistakably strong opinion among these players you can bet your monthly salary on that there's gameplay insight involved. If balancing the mod is to move forward efficiently then documenting these voices should go a long way together with the overall discussions among Github contributors to get these changes into the playtests. Case in point, the Mig/Longbow buff with #11337 came out of community interest but was driven mostly because of interest by contributors. In turn contributors interpreted the buffs differently from what was originally proposed by the players (from damage vs armor buff and price reduction towards range and rate of fire buffs) which so far (tested for months) doesn't look like it will bring Longbows and especially MiGs much closer to be included in the meta with the next release. When players such as newwe, Kyrylo, Murto and klaas in the prior balance discussion brings up points as to how buffs ought to be implemented, and is subsequently ignored, you should expect the end result to come up short.\n\nGame balance is one of the few things in the development that needs a particularly strong influence from the playing community. That's why beta testing exists for pretty much every AAA game out there, especially complex RTS multiplayer games - in order for for SC and COH to develop an advanced and exciting meta from beginning to end of any match, committed players are brought in for months to playtest the hell out of the game, directly influencing the flow and vibe of the game. Now, OpenRA is OpenRA but the above principle is no less relevant for the direction of the game balance.\n\nWith all that said, I'm not gonna immediately double down with another PR after the Mammoth PR plus I needed the above expressed before I could expect any chance whatsoever to have any other changes merged with another playtest. So here's a list of idiot-proof balance changes, cross-checked by hundreds of games by committed players over the course of many months that was intended to be brought on to seperate PRs before the playtests:\n\n**Mammoth Tank:**\nSpeed 50, up from 42\n\nShould be self explanatory even after the wheel-of-fortune style of commenting by users (including myself) in #11713. Turn rate buff is out of the question - the Mammoth Tank already has a turn rate close to that of the Heavy and Medium Tank so unless you want this unit looking like an elephant doing pirouettes on the battlefield then this should be left alone. As pointed to in the forum discussion thread linked in the PR the speed buff is exactly what is expressed as the most crucial element as to making this unit useful for whatever purpose you want it assigned to. The artillery nerf vs the speed 50 Mammoth has been proven long time ago to be an **absolute non-issue**. \nAlso, because it happened: http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=82&t=19767&sid=d2c42d564fb40f668711c201b1803296\n\n**Light Tank:**\nReloadDelay doubled, Damage doubled\nDamage vs Heavy Armor +12,5%\nDamage vs Light Armor +20%\n\nTested somewhat in the shadow of the other balance changes but has proved valuable in extending the units longevity and adding options to the Allied early- to mid-game. A concern with the rate-of-fire was raised on http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=82&t=19768 but I lastly got an IRC msg from MustaphaTR saying he wouldn't oppose it should I push it.\n\nEdit: Alternatively, ReloadDelay + Damage, both up by approx. 69%. Both values scales really well to this approx % number - ReloadDelay, from 13 to 22 = 69,2% increase and Damage, from 16 to 27 = 68,8%. The reason I initially doubled it was because it was the safest way to alter the fire rate (at least until #11719 comes along).\n\n**Missile Sub:**\nCost: $2000, down from $2400\nDamage: 25, down from 30\nAdded air as a valid target\nVisual: Adjusted missile trajectory\n\nThis is an old one but it's really bad that this hasn't made it's way into the game yet. Hamb first exposed this on his twitch a year ago and pretty much got a round of applause. This balance change more or less drowned in the balance discussions raging on before and after the 20151224 holiday release and pretty much remained dormant. However it was brought back in map playtesting from May this year and despite having limited visibility due to being a Naval late tech unit has delivered as expected, picking off lazy Hinds and Longbows over or close to water with the sudden burst of its submissiles. Plays well and fun as hell. The damage and cost was somewhat reduced to gain the unit a little more accessibility. There's also a version provided on Frame Limiter's playtest maps with the AA being a more efficient seeker missile.\n\n**Camo. Pillbox:** \nHealth: 450HP down from 600HP\n\nShould be self-explanatory. The camo pillbox having cloak and at the same giving the same health/price value as the regular pillbox makes it way op. It tanks way too much for its price considering its often met unexpectedly giving the defender a Heavy Tanks worth of HP before the attacker can refocus over to other targets. Not long ago the camo. pillbox was super close to being merged in as a french exclusive structure #11431. It was playtested for some time, indicating that overall it lessened the gameplay experience for the remaining Allied factions not having the camo. pillbox available for various scenarios where the cloak trait was neccessary. The next step was playtesting the camo pillbox as more of an option by nerfing the HP, meaning Allied players was at all times choosing between stealth or damage soak value which made both the reguar and camo. pillbox more distinct. The latest change was playtested extensively since late July and pretty much proved its concept.\n\n**Shock Troopers:**\nHealth: 45HP, down from 60HP\n\nIt's a bit funny how the shock trooper has faded away a bit from competetive play the past couple of months. This made me think of the 100HP shock trooper deliberately not being used in matches precisely because they were OP. This isn't exactly the story here but the shock trooper still is super strong if you can get to them safely. Murto, pretty much becoming a scapegoat for the most recent balance discussion about the strong shock trooper, recently left Russia behind despite crushing the player base with late tech Russia in favor of the more \"fun\" Ukraine. Although the discussions was overall pretty divided on what alterations was needed, the most conservative and accepted one was an additional health nerf bringing the shock trooper health down to the level of the rocket trooper. This in order to aid specific counters such as Artillery, V2, Yak, Hinds and Parabombs. The playtesting proved the nerf to be at most moderate but rewards micro and did help stopping shock trooper swarms on narrow maps.\nRelevant discussion: http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=82&p=296107#296107\n\n**Allied Tech Center:**\nHealth: 600HP, up from 400HP\n\nThe low health on the Allied Tech Center has been an issue for some time, especially with Parabombs that will have at minimum one shot at guarantee-sniping the structure before the GPS satellite is done, forcing the Allied player to build two tech centers. With the recent changes in the playtest, making the GPS satellite liable to loss of the Radar Dome _and_ base powerdowns (#11018) I think it would be a good time to up the health a bit. This HP buff has been with the earliest playtest maps, showing modest  but positive results - effectively, 600HP allows the tech center to retain about 10% health after a full Parabomb drop and requires two YAKs to empty it's entire arsenal forcing them to do two complete swipes or bring in a 3rd Yak do get a snipe of an AA protected tech center. Virtually the same effect applies to Hinds.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11995/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11994","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11994/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11994/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11994/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11994","id":175368801,"number":11994,"title":"gdi07
