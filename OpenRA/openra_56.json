Might as well refer to the main discussion thread on topic: http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=82&t=19825 You'll be able to find the same opinions scattered throughout various balance discussions on the forum. E.g.:\r\nhttp://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=82&p=298839#298839\r\nhttp://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=82&t=19845\r\nhttp://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=82&t=19854\r\n\r\nTo summarize shortly, the cheap Pillboxes and Gun Turrets simply provides the incentive for Allies players to spam them non-stop throughout games, securing all flanks almost for free preventing counterattacks, expanding with little-to-no risk and quickly fortifying an lone MCV expansion literally within the minute. \r\n\r\nThe changes has been playtested on modded maps delivered by Frame Limiter, FiveAces and myself (playtest maps v1.4) on and off stream with a few hunded downloads as well as on a playtest build showcased on stream, with particular feedback on the latter: http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=82&p=298663#298663\r\n\r\nAdditionally this specific balance issue has been in context of ideas involving reducing defensive structure's production bonus of multiple MCV's and/or also reducing the custom build time for the MCV itself. These are showing some good promise but hasn't been covered in the same extent as the above. By itself this balance PR is regarded as a step in the right direction.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12470/reactions","total_count":12,"+1":5,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":4}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12469","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12469/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12469/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12469/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12469","id":194850037,"number":12469,"title":"[RA] Rename Shipyard and Transport Helicopter","user":{"login":"SoScared","id":2715583,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2715583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared","html_url":"https://github.com/SoScared","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-12-11T19:18:30Z","updated_at":"2016-12-14T13:13:18Z","closed_at":"2016-12-14T13:10:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/12469","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12469","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12469.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12469.patch"},"body":"Adresses #12197 of which don't need meddling with SHP files.\r\n\r\n- Shipyard -> Naval Yard\r\n\r\nBecause it's a Naval Yard in the build tab and it's called Naval Yard by players. #5992\r\n\r\n- Transport Helicopter -> Chinook\r\n\r\nSame reasoning as above.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12469/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12468","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12468/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12468/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12468/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12468","id":194849098,"number":12468,"title":"Let large fire turn into small fire before they extinguish.","user":{"login":"SoScared","id":2715583,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2715583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared","html_url":"https://github.com/SoScared","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33149887,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Polish","name":"Polish","color":"FF9933","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-12-11T19:01:56Z","updated_at":"2016-12-11T22:07:49Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"![treeburn](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2715583/21082464/4c31ac74-bfdc-11e6-9df4-bfef97864ea7.jpg)\r\n\r\nCurrently they both vanish simoultaneously.

IMO this background is more polished than the unfinished shellmap, and it serves as an example for modders who might want to do a more elaborate non-map menu background.\r\n\r\nCloses #3016.\r\nCloses #6943.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12465/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12464","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12464/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12464/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12464/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12464","id":194781588,"number":12464,"title":"ReinforceWithTransport can be blocked","user":{"login":"CH4Code","id":16046997,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16046997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CH4Code","html_url":"https://github.com/CH4Code","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CH4Code/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CH4Code/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CH4Code/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CH4Code/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CH4Code/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CH4Code/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CH4Code/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CH4Code/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CH4Code/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382400,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"d7e102","default":false},{"id":76857560,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Scripting","name":"Scripting","color":"006b75","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-12-10T17:42:14Z","updated_at":"2016-12-15T16:22:37Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"in a LUA script using Reinforcements.ReinforceWithTransport() uses a transport which can be blocked from landing by vehicle-impassable terrain or units placed underneath.\r\n\r\nIt does not try to \"scatter\" and land in an adjacent tile like the transport of the HarvesterInsurance or the regular Carryall.

\"NavyPortLoad\" and you link it with the player starting point,so the AI will know that it relates to it,and can use it.so the AI builds up a transport ship and sent it at that point,and then loads up the units,and then it sent them to another point called \"NavyPortUnLoad\" that point is linked to \"NavyPortLoad\" of the AI that is currently attacking,so the AI will know that it can path to
