Since these new layers are eventually stuffed back into the pool when the finalizer does run, this can theoretically leak unbounded memory until the pool goes out of scope. In practice it would leak tens of megabytes.\n\nThe new implementation ensures layers are disposed and pooled correctly to allow proper memory reuse. It also introduces some safeguards against memory leaks:\n- A cap is set on the number of pooled layers. If more concurrent layers are needed than this, then the excess layers will not be pooled but instead be allowed to be garbage collected.\n- No finalizer. An implementation that fails to call dispose simply allows the layer to be garbage collected instead.\n\n---\n\nProposed changelog: Lump in with \"Improved in-game performance and memory usage.\"\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9358","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9358/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9358/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9358/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9358","id":106803655,"number":9358,"title":"Fix a crash when the stnk of TS is cloaking","user":{"login":"abcdefg30","id":7704140,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7704140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30","html_url":"https://github.com/abcdefg30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-09-16T15:54:44Z","updated_at":"2015-09-18T21:09:35Z","closed_at":"2015-09-17T23:05:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/9358","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9358","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9358.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9358.patch"},"body":"Fixes #9353.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9357","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9357/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9357/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9357/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9357","id":106706209,"number":9357,"title":"Added a LineImpactProjectile (Attempt 2)","user":{"login":"UberWaffe","id":2726355,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2726355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/UberWaffe","html_url":"https://github.com/UberWaffe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UberWaffe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UberWaffe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UberWaffe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UberWaffe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UberWaffe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UberWaffe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UberWaffe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UberWaffe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UberWaffe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":76,"created_at":"2015-09-16T06:10:12Z","updated_at":"2015-12-05T18:17:06Z","closed_at":"2015-12-05T17:09:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/9357","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9357","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9357.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9357.patch"},"body":"Attempt number 2 at  #6252\n\nNew projectile can create multiple weapon impacts along its travel vector.\n(i.e. apply all warheads effects at multiple positions as it travels).\n\nIt has a leading head position, and a following tail position, and renders a beam (LaserZap) between these two positions. Weapon impacts are created (iteratively over the distance) between the head and tail, at definable intervals.\n\nThe tail position (origin of beam) tracks the firing actor until it detaches and travels on its own. This means that if you move the firing actor while the beam is firing, it does track correctly.\n\nYou can currently tell it to:\n- Define how many ticks the tail must lag the head (i.e. the length of the travelling beam).\n- Create an impact every WRange, every X ticks, between head and tail.\n- Only create an impact if at least WRange away from its source.\n- Only create an impact if at least within WRange of its target.\n- Keep traveling for up to WRange beyond its target.\n- Have damage falloff (essentially passed as a firepowermodifier to the weapon during impact) that\n  - Has a WRange before it starts\n  - Has a WRange at which it reaches maximum falloff\n  - Has a maximum falloff.\n\nWas based off mixture of Bullet and LaserZap.\n\nDoes NOT support\n- A proper rendering engine to make it look like something other than a basic beam. (Currently looks fine for instant-hit beams. But slow-moving beams are ugly.)\n\nI still have to do:\n- The target is a static position, so if you fire at a moving actor, even while the firing actor is still busy emitting the beam, the head does not 'track' the target. Not sure how to do this. (Would like to make this an Info setting.)\n- ~~Add Ray-casting, finding all actors within the bounds of the beam's length and width. #8186~~\n- ~~Make warheads apply to actors directly, ignoring warhead spreads.~~ (Causes crashes and unexpected behavior. Will require some warhead refactoring, or at least a new warhead type.)\n- ~~When the actor is ordered to stop, the beam should stop emitting if still busy.~~\n- ~~When the actor dies, the beam should stop emitting if still busy.~~\n\nStill to be tested:\n- ~~That walls properly block the beam if the beam is blockable.~~\n- ~~That the projectile properly works for 'short' beams, such as D2K sonic ball.~~ Works, though very short beams render as practically invisible.\n- ~~That the projectile properly works for brief instant-hit beams, such as TS railguns.~~ Works\n\nCloses  #4458.\n\nI've attempted to apply it to the D2K sonic tank, and the TS disruptor tank, but balancing needs work.\n\n@pchote: I've re-read and attempted to apply all the requests in #6252.
