When orcas and apaches are towards the edge of a map, especially the corners and especially in larger groups, some will often go on an excursion. The aircraft can then only be made to return at certain angles, along certain paths. You can not bring them back directly. Left alone, the aircraft are prone to moving large distances outside of the map, even along the entire length of a map.\r\n\r\nThis is easy to reproduce: build five apaches or orcas then tell them, as a group, to move to the corner of the map. Keep them selected and watch as one leaves the map and e.g. comes back to another corner. I attach an example replay (on a stock map and created in release-20170527). \r\n\r\nThis issue seemed to arise a release or two ago. Perhaps it coincided with the fix to the bug that meant aircraft could not be targeted when at the very top of the map. \r\n\r\nN.B.

For example, in this replay:\r\n  https://www.gamereplays.org/openra/replays.php?game=92&show=details&id=320073\r\nthe map hash toward the beginning of the file is (found, in this case, using 'less'):\r\n        Map: 58da5c480d13a00a07c9bee00f928f70564f188f\r\n\r\nHowever, the game was played on the map with hash: \r\n  a03d9bfa8211e6d5233b4734ae40eefe52b19de1\r\nThat hash appears later on in the replay file and OpenRA does realise which map the game was actually played on.\r\n\r\nI suspect that this occurs when the map was changed in the lobby.

you look at the code.

As this is the most common case (in our official mods and likely most external ones, too), we could save a bunch of yaml lines and make the trait a bit more intuitive by introducing an `AlwaysUseWeapon` boolean that does just what it implies, completely ignoring `EmptyWeapon` and payload state. This would allow us to set it to `true` on actor defaults and then only set it to false in special cases like harvesters, artillery, Grenadiers etc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13444/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13443","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13443/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13443/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13443/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13443","id":233380564,"number":13443,"title":"Add a VERSION file to simplify engine version checks for mods.","user":{"login":"pchote","id":167819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/167819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote","html_url":"https://github.com/pchote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/23/labels","id":2556950,"number":23,"title":"Next Release","description":"","creator":{"login":"reaperrr","id":2857877,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2857877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperrr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2,"closed_issues":231,"state":"open","created_at":"2017-06-01T19:00:24Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T20:57:42Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-06-03T16:39:21Z","updated_at":"2017-06-04T11:26:53Z","closed_at":"2017-06-04T11:21:28Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/13443","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13443","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13443.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13443.patch"},"body":"Dropping support for the `RequiresMod` metadata had an unfortunate side effect of removing the only simple way we had for mods to check/force a specific engine version.  \r\n\r\nAccording to @jrb0001 players with the wrong engine version desyncing games is an ongoing problem for the Crystallized Doom mod, and I need a simple way to query the engine version for the mod template.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a VERSION file in the source/install root that external scripts can read to get the current engine version.
