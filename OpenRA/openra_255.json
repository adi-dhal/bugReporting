makes the AI take into consideration whether or not it can target a unit when considering how attractive a target it is for its support power - if it can't be targetted then it's not considered.\n\nI tested this change by creating a large number of stealth tanks and having them sat clumped together as bait - when cloaked the AI didn't air strike them and instead chose another target. When uncloaked (I made them force fire on a bit of terrain) it saw them and air striked them (as they were by far the most obvious target).\n\nI think this will make it a bit more fun to use stealth tanks against the AI - it decimated my stealth tanks the other day and I was a little bit displeased (╯°□°)╯︵

two platforms have a lot in common with respect to OpenRA:\n- They have active community-maintained repositories that already include higher-quality OpenRA packages than what our automated build can provide.\n- They have very few direct downloads from the website (around 1% or less of all downloads).\n- They are disproportionately difficult for us to package:\n  - We need to compile pkgbuild from source as part the packaging scripts.\n  - We need to ship consistently-named libraries in the rpm because the different distros use different library names (and mono doesn't support multiple alternatives).\n\nI would like to remove rpm and pkgbuild from our automated packaging script (`make install` would be unaffected) so that we can simplify and focus it on our three platforms that don't have a strong community-distribution channel.  We would keep the platform icons on the download page, but they would direct users to the downstream distribution channel like we already do for Gentoo.\n\nSee also #4248.\n\n<bountysource-plugin>\n\n---\n\nWant to back this issue?
