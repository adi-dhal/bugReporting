`stand2` if it was unused and/or a duplicate of `stand`\n- fixed `prone-stand` sequences to define `Stride` instead of `Length`\n- added `prone-stand2` (copy-paste of `prone-stand`) to all infantry with `stand2`\n- fixed d2k rifle infantry `prone-stand` sequence (it was using standup frames)\n- removed now redundant duplicate trait definitions from individual d2k infantry types.*\n\n*I did NOT

guys, so this map is now completed. Consider this somewhat \"beta\" version. I plan to gather your opinions, bugs and other comments and also for fixing harvester logic (https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8446).\n\nImportant information:\n-3 levels of difficulty, on hard AI Expands on Island right waway, Easy decreases size/increases interval of reinforcements.\n-#8446 evaded by creating a Refinery next to the orefield and deleting on 1st tick after harv is intialized.\n-AI is able to build it's base on the Island and even rebuild it, but there are some bugs that need more coding/are hard to implement and will be open to discussion, namely: AI can place the next building that is currently being produced after the CYard is destroyed. AI doesn't need money to build (it has two refineries and it loses the money, just doesn't checks if he has enough), it's building queue works as in original - no parallel building of defensive structures.\n-AI produces units as it should\n-Second MCV can be aquired by entering the western side of the island after the Radar is captured\n\nFeel free to post anything relevant to future development so I can deliver a version for next stable.\n\nPS. Thanks to abcdefg30 and also other guys who were willing to help me with lua and git!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8484/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8483","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8483/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8483/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8483/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8483","id":88163521,"number":8483,"title":"Fixes regression with selection classes","user":{"login":"matija-hustic","id":5747153,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5747153?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic","html_url":"https://github.com/matija-hustic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/15","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestone/15","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/15/labels","id":1127295,"number":15,"title":"release-20150919","description":"","creator":{"login":"obrakmann","id":4331210,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4331210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann","html_url":"https://github.com/obrakmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":96,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-05-24T08:30:48Z","updated_at":"2015-12-24T15:13:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2015-09-20T11:23:40Z"},"comments":12,"created_at":"2015-06-14T10:34:34Z","updated_at":"2015-06-26T00:47:25Z","closed_at":"2015-06-25T13:51:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/8483","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8483","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8483.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8483.patch"},"body":"Fixes regression from #8212, as @Phrohdoh remarked:\nSelect all units on screen should use selection priorities to determine who actually gets selected.
