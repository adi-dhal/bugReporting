more problem with air units :)\n\nI didn't find a way to back air units to a predefined position \n- either a previously targeted building they didn't finish to destroy \n- or to the rally point\n\n(Is there any way ?)\n\nFor example, rally point works for the Service Depot, so you don't need to micro a repaired unit. \nI think the same would be useful for air units.\n\nAnother reason to fix this : reloaded air units in stand-by block the production. Sending them back automatically to the field could solve the problem.\n\nMicro wouldn't disappear, as you would have to manage your units and their reload cycles, if you have more units than airfields / helipads. \nBut it would reduce the annoyances I cited before, and make airforce more comfortable to use.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue?
