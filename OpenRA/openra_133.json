this fix, actors which had an idle animation (not an overlay, but a looping `idle` sequence with more than 1 frame) as well as an `active` animation of some kind would get stuck at the last frame of

all of them.\n\nThis has gone unnoticed because there are only very few actors in the shipping mods with more than 1 idle frame (RA airfields are the only case I can think of), while TS uses
