wanted to try the mono profiler, to see what output it generates.\r\ni played a skirmich game for a few minutes with profiling enabled.\r\nin the report generated these method appear with the highest self-time (time spent in method itself). you should read the list bottom up.\r\n\r\nit seems Widget get_ChildOrigin and get_RenderOrigin are called over 33million times in those few minutes. In total over 5+ and 2+ seconds in spent in both method. \r\n\r\nwhen i read it the source it seem RenderOrigin calls ChildOrigin.\r\n\r\nperhaps you would like to optimize these method. \r\n- Not use a properties (get/set), but directly access the Bounds member as a variable.\r\n- If Parent == null, return a int2(Bounds.X, Bounds.Y) with adding int2.Zero, save 2 additions of zero\r\n- Store Bounds.X and Bounds.Y as a int2 class variable. Avoiding the need for int2(Bounds.X, Bounds.Y) each time.\r\n- Remove ChildOrigin as it calls RenderOrigin directly, saving a function call.\r\n- EventBounds calls RenderBounds, remove one, save a function call.\r\n- GetEventBounds, already has a PERF comment, \r\n- Vertex constructor is called a lot, probably difficult to optimize.\r\n- Try to remove the iterator/MoveNext\r\n\r\n\r\nTop 200,

like to propose implementing a common interface for input devices which translates specific input events (e.g. three finger swipe on a macbook trackpad...) coming from a myriad of input devices (like touchscreens, trackpads, mice, gamepads etc...) into general game events (like moving a unit somewhere or selecting a few units etc..) so, for example, touch screen controls on windows 10 tablets can be made more pleasant (I don't actually own a windows 10 tablet, however i can't imagine that simply treating touch events like a mouse could be as intuitive as it should be). \r\n\r\nThe reasoning behind this proposal is that I sometimes like to play a bit of OpenRA casually on my Macbook, however most often without a mouse, although it's not too bad of an experience, I'd like to implement proper trackpad gestures like multiselecting with a three swinger swipe across the trackpad or focusing on the MCV with a three finger double tap on the trackpad, just to name a few examples. I think that this could be a major improvement to the experience overall and by having a proper plugabble driver-like architecture in the engine for input devices, we could make the gameplay more pleasant across the board and therefore attract more players. I personally think that having such an architecture where everybody could write \"drivers\" against would benefit the project immensly and I would be willing to do the necessary work (after exams...) of implementing my proposal. With a common input architecture, we could also make a TV-mode, which would work surprisingly well (I played Red Alert on my Playstation 1 back in the days) without duplicated effort","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12488","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12488/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12488/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12488/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12488","id":196274030,"number":12488,"title":"Fixed Open.Nat directory name case","user":{"login":"draculus","id":2422776,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2422776?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/draculus","html_url":"https://github.com/draculus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/draculus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/draculus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/draculus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/draculus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/draculus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/draculus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/draculus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/draculus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/draculus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-12-18T12:53:04Z","updated_at":"2016-12-23T16:35:09Z","closed_at":"2016-12-23T14:33:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/12488","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12488","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12488.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12488.patch"},"body":"On GNU/Linux the directory would not be found during `cp` and `rm` because name Open.NAT was created as Open.Nat.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12488/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12487","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12487/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12487/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12487/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12487","id":196245821,"number":12487,"title":"MiGs and YAKs return to base when using 'stop' hotkey","user":{"login":"SoScared","id":2715583,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2715583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared","html_url":"https://github.com/SoScared","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":21877809,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Red%20Alert","name":"Red Alert","color":"8B0000","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-12-17T22:12:40Z","updated_at":"2017-05-05T09:57:55Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"They already do this with the 'deploy' hotkey.

Or just geneally disable production when powered down ( != low power).\r\n\r\nAdvantage of the `RequiresPower` trait would be, that it is a general concept which can be applied to may building traits (compare C&C3, where you could power down everything).
