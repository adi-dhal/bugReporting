Another track when the attack start in the mission, and triggers when first nuke is sent. etc.. First time godzilla arrive, victory music... Should be controlled by lua\r\n- Make it easy for modders to include track with maps, also on repeat and as environment/ambient background\r\n- Multiple tracks should be allowed to be played at once, like the aud's\r\n- Easy bundling: Mp3 included in .oramap will be played when map starts, with no code needed in yaml or lua\r\n\r\nIn my humble opinion, this would change a lot about map-modding.

been doing a bit of modding recently in an effort to find a use for the Forward Command structure in the Red Alert mod that wasn't build radius or vision range; my idea was to make it similar to the Veteran Academy from RA3 where in by you capture the Forward Command and all newly trained units you produce will be granted a rank up from the get-go. this idea can be done with a Prerequisite called 'ArmoryLevelUp' and then change the Prerequisite on the units from the building.upgraded to house that Prerequisite within the trait 'ProducibleWithLevel' but it only does it to rank 1 (although gives you an idea what is after); now it is possible to do it in Lua and work out a way to stack traits from the Yaml so this trick will work... good luck in working that one out and get back to me when progress has been made, i'll attempt to work something out as well so we can keep brainstorming through :)
