aim and shoot instantly (even if they spot an enemy in their back), giving a faster gameplay and allowing some hit & run (attack-move) moves.\nUnfortunately vehicles must rotate their turret or rotate themselves to aim. \nSuppose I spot a hijacker in one or two cells behind my mammoth tank, whatever I do the mammoth tank will be lost because it rotates too slowly to target the hijacker (and it can kill the hijacker by shooting at him only one time !). \n\n![sans titre](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8930382/4425010/118fe116-45a5-11e4-9513-cadb38d29085.png)\n\nSame scenarios with helicopters shot down by bazookas in their back, arties shot down because they rotate too slowly to flee, submarines sunk by submarines in their back, and so on …\n\nIs it possible to include an option which allows to remove all types of vehicle rotations to have an instant aiming and therefore faster and more brutal games (I imagine that there would be a simple condition to skip rotations/animations in the code) ?\n\nThere would be no need to \"pre place\" vehicles anymore (to “pre target” a potential enemy), no delay between detection and shooting, no players prevailing over other players simply because the vehicles look somewhere, and the gameplay would be closer to e-sports games.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6558/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6557","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6557/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6557/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6557/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/6557","id":44059752,"number":6557,"title":"Unhardcoded

The current behavior is the server freezes forever waiting for the missing clients to respond until the game timeouts.\n\nThis is incredibly frustrating for free-for-all and to an extent, larger team games. More often than not players wish to continue. This fixes the bug by recognizing that clients aren't communicating and eventually drops them so the game can continue.\n\nFirst the server responds to say it's still alive and waiting, then after a while it shows who isn't responding. Finally after 2 minutes it drops the players. I recommend at least 1.5 minutes before dropping players as often a router can be restarted within a minute and in the original games often found you'd missed the 60 second deadline only by a few seconds.\n\nThis is an important fix as the majority of games going down on hetzner, etc. are because of this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6546/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6545","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6545/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6545/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6545/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6545","id":43631414,"number":6545,"title":"You can go inside neutral AI vehicles with infantry but you cant get out","user":{"login":"VagueVigor","id":5774552,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5774552?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VagueVigor","html_url":"https://github.com/VagueVigor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VagueVigor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VagueVigor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VagueVigor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VagueVigor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VagueVigor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VagueVigor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VagueVigor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VagueVigor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VagueVigor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382400,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"d7e102","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2014-09-23T13:50:37Z","updated_at":"2015-02-24T19:44:19Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Thats weird.
