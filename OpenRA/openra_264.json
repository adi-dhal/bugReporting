Goal\n\nI'm attempting to revive @obrakmann's clever #5022, since as pchote said:\n\n> Probably not much perf wins yet, but this adds an interface that we can use for celltriggers and per-player autotarget maps (which should give quite a big perf win).\n\nWIP branch can be found here: https://github.com/UberWaffe/OpenRA/compare/INotifyActorMovement\n### Background\n\nI did some code-digging for this from scratch on my own and also came to the conclusion that all `Actor.CenterPosition` changes inevitably go through `ActorMap.UpdatePosition` even when actors get added to the world via `AddPosition`.\n\nThe only real difference is that I've taken the bulletin board approach. (I.e. `ActorMap.UpdatePosition` pushes data to `MovementAnnouncer`, which informs all `IMovementListener`)\n\nThe Announcer differentiates between position changes `PositionMovementAnnouncement` and cell changes `CellMovementAnnouncement`.\n\nTraits implementing `IMovementListener` have to register / unregister as needed to receive announcements.\n### Help needed\n\nInitial tests on `RevealsShroud` looks good, though I do not know how to do a proper performance test on this.\n\nInitial tests on `MapRegion` works, but I have not yet successfully tied in LUA to it. If someone could explain the basic concepts behind `ScriptTriggers.cs` to me, I'd appreciate it.\n\nLastly, comments on the overall approach would also be appreciated.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6203","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6203/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6203/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6203/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6203","id":39797285,"number":6203,"title":"Color

sure if this is in the right place)\n- Map.NamedActor now returns `nil` if the actor is Destroyed\n\nI'm more interested in a review right now rather than a merge, because there ~~might~~ will be more

way for a mod to include atmosphere effects such as day/night, hot/clear/overcast, rain/storm/snowing, etc?\n\nExcept for maybe very small \"rain\" sprites, this wouldn't need more than some way to darken or change the hue on the screen (for example, a hot day would have a slight yellow to look like the sun searing through the map, or night would make the map much darker).\n\nBeing able to cycle through them with programmable timers in a widget would be great too, to add even more variety to the game.\n\nExtra idea: rain/snow effect would slightly slow movement of units, and storms would
