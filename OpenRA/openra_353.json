I tested this against it. Note: there is a problem with inheritance `..\\` vs `../` which breaks a solution wide settings file so I had to copy & paste the file into each projects directory. :/\n\nEven though I disarmed it, we have >1000 warnings per project. Once we agreed on standards and those get fixed, we could have our CI check for those automatically in the future so we don't have to manually tell everyone how to format the code with each new contributor pull request. Also helps me write code in accordance if I have some lint tool to warn me when I am doing it wrong.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3532","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3532/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3532/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3532/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3532","id":16432740,"number":3532,"title":"Anti aircraft units and buildings don't damage aircrafts right on top of them","user":{"login":"Fahrradkette","id":4951351,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4951351?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fahrradkette","html_url":"https://github.com/Fahrradkette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fahrradkette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fahrradkette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fahrradkette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fahrradkette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fahrradkette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fahrradkette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fahrradkette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fahrradkette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fahrradkette/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33149887,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Polish","name":"Polish","color":"FF9933","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"pchote","id":167819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/167819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote","html_url":"https://github.com/pchote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"pchote","id":167819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/167819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote","html_url":"https://github.com/pchote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2013-07-06T16:33:51Z","updated_at":"2013-07-27T00:58:37Z","closed_at":"2013-07-27T00:57:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"If a heli is right on top of a missle site or anti aircraft gun, it will get shot but won't get any damage from it.
