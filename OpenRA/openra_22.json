of the big focuses of the next release has been decentralizing our engine so that modders aren't restricted by our default engine/mods install.  #13223 fell nicely under this umbrella point, leaving the voxel code as the last hardcoded format, and also the last piece of reverse-engineered proprietary logic in the core engine.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that by separating our voxel code into a generic model loading interface in the engine, and moving the voxel-specific code to Mods.Cnc.dll.  Once this has been merged we can proudly announce that our core engine is 100% free / clean code 🎉.  This also makes it a lot easier to implement #4689 at some point in the future.\r\n\r\nThis isn't nearly as intimidating as it looks, and should be straightforward to review if you go commit by commit (but note that github has messed up the display order).\r\nThe only real changes are in:\r\n* \"Add backend plumbing for model loaders.\": implements new backend for defining and creating the mod-level model loaders and model sequence merging.\r\n* \"Move Voxel code to Mods.Cnc.\": Ports the old `VoxelProvider` code over to the new `VoxelModelSequenceLoader`.\r\n\r\nEverything else is just renaming or moving code.\r\n\r\nThe old code relied on static state, with `ModData.InitializeLoaders` manually clearing and reloading the state as part of the map load.  The new code has `ModelCache` owned by the  `World`, which gives the same lifetime as before but without the ugly manual management.\r\n\r\nI have not written an upgrade rule for the `VoxelSequences` &rarr; `ModelSequences` map yaml rename because that would mean bumping the map format for a feature that we don't use at all in our default mods and which we don't officially support yet for modders.\r\n\r\nI will rename the `WithVoxel*` traits in a followup PR to reduce the rebase conflicts that come with renaming and upgrade rules.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13485/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13484","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13484/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13484/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13484/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13484","id":234781413,"number":13484,"title":"Added Polygon IHitShape","user":{"login":"atlimit8","id":4957137,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4957137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8","html_url":"https://github.com/atlimit8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":289856724,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Fixup%20requested","name":"PR: Fixup requested","color":"eb6420","default":false},{"id":117740707,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Rebase%20me!","name":"PR: Rebase me!","color":"eb6420","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/13","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestone/13","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/13/labels","id":930452,"number":13,"title":"Future","description":"This milestone is meant for stuff we want fixed, but don't have a timeline for yet.

https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/102/\r\n\r\n> High Sierra will be the last macOS release to support 32-bit apps without compromises.\r\n> From the next major release after High Sierra we are going to start aggressively warning users if apps are not compatible with 64 bit.\r\n\r\nThis gives us about 12 - 15 months to move to a 64 bit build.  Apple will be removing 32 bit support entirely in a further year or so, so there is no point offering a fat binary with both architectures.\r\n\r\nMono 5.0 now ships with the 64 bit runtime, so the technical parts are easy:\r\n* Recompile `libSDL2.dylib` and `liblua.5.1.dylib` as 64 bit.\r\n* Change `-m32` to `-m64` in the [osx launcher makefile](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRALauncherOSX/blob/master/Makefile)\r\n* Bump our minimum mono requirement to 5.0.\r\n\r\nThe launcher should then automatically load and use the 64 bit runtime.\r\n\r\nBefore we do this we need to make sure we understand and prepare for any potential stability or performance effects.  The best way to do this will be to collect a few representative replays for the main mods recorded on the current (32 bit) release, and then play them back using `mono64`.  Comparing the play times should give us some stats on the overall perf changes, and any runtime incompatibilities will manifest as desyncs.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13478/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13477","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13477/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13477/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13477/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13477","id":234488618,"number":13477,"title":"Bridge
