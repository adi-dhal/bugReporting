This worked but introduced another issue, that is ... the pathplanning is not optimal because the dog will run to the wall, stop and needs to reroute. I think that is not really wanted. So maybe we could introduce a new option that some weapons (such as the DogJaw) can only be fired with no obstructions with the target, modify the path planner to keep this in mind and build in a check on the leap to prevent jumping over blocked tiles. \r\n\r\nAny ideas about this?

i was talking to @ScottNZ about the new wave of people (mostly new players) ... using APC-Flamerushes in almost every game ... and that this (soviet) Attack itself is way easier to perform compared to the (allies) defense ... \nit might be possible to defend 1 apc with 5 flamethrowers , but even then it can be really hard , if you dont expect the apc ... (and seriously ... people should have the chance to to setup a quick  defense for every sneaky/easy rush-tactics) \n\ni do agree that it is a appropriate tactic for a soviet player , and i still want people to use it ... but it should atleast cost some attention and micromanagement for the attacker... not just a click to drive the apc to the location and then a \"f\"-key hit to watch the enemy struggling to not loose his mcv within the first 5 minutes ... \n\n@ScottNZ said , we could make the APC slower ... so there is more time to bring the APC down ... \n\nturrets for example cant reach a apc because he is too fast (there is a exception when the apc drives frontal directly towards the turret , which basicly never happens)\n\nPillboxes have the problem to get triggered by the APC , but does no damage whatsoever ... instead , the owner of the Pillbox has to wait until the enemy \"unloads\" the flamethrowers ... and then he has to manually target every enemy .... after every dead target , the pillbox-targeting will jump back to the enemy Apc (depends on the randomness of the \"cargo drop\" ... ) and you have to pick the next target again ... \n\nthe pillbox-cannon needs for every passenger 2 shots ... (the flamethrower might have less health then a e1 ... but its enough so the pillbox needs still 2 bursts to bring a flamethrower down) \n\nbut its not like my enemy has to put his man in any danger .... the high armor + hp + speed of the apc ... allows easily to avoid defense-structures and just choose a different location and drop the cargo out of defense-range \n\na pillbox does 30 damage on infantry ... \ne1 has 50hp \nflamethrower has 40hp \n\nthis has a hudge impact when 5 enemy flamethrowers get unloadet right beside a Construction Yard\n\nso there is definitly more then just a slower apc  ... i have a few ideas \n- flamethrower should not have the same range like a e1 ... (seriously , if we talk about a close-combat unit then we should tweak the range down ... we basicly give flames the same range as a bullet )\n- flamethrowers should have the abillity to take out the passengers inside a pillbox , leaving a empty pillbox (or maybe just a chance) \n- similar to the grenadier , there should be a chance for the flamethrower to \"explode\" ... leaving a 2-3 cell \"flame carpet\" on the ground for a short time  , which hurts other infantry when stepping over it (or standing inside) ... this chance to explode should preferable depend on the facing-direction of the flamethrower ... and the direction of the bullet\n\ndont get me wrong , i really like the unit ... but currently ... it only does a \"shitload\" of damage on buildings (grenadiers have the exact same purpose) ... just with a different sprite-sheet \n\nso im open for new ideas ... or balancing in terms of the flamethrower/apc\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7502","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7502/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7502/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7502/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7502","id":58195058,"number":7502,"title":"Add Graph for Memory Usage and more Debug Infos","user":{"login":"LipkeGu","id":2057932,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2057932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LipkeGu","html_url":"https://github.com/LipkeGu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LipkeGu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LipkeGu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LipkeGu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LipkeGu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LipkeGu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LipkeGu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LipkeGu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LipkeGu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LipkeGu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382420,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Idea/Wishlist","name":"Idea/Wishlist","color":"e102d8","default":false},{"id":6382530,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Performance","name":"Performance","color":"02e10c","default":false},{"id":124120259,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/UI","name":"UI","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-02-19T11:14:18Z","updated_at":"2015-07-04T11:42:16Z","closed_at":"2015-07-04T11:42:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Some Games like Minecraft Prints the MemoryUsage from the Process and the Video Memory (vram) onto the Screen.

Let’s say we have a 2 vs 2 vs 2 match. The 2 players could be blue, the other 2 yellow and the rest green.\n\n2)have the player and the observer to change the color of the selected player to “FoF”, Green from himself, Yellow for all his allies, and Red for all his Enemies.\n\n3)in addition to the first 2 ideas, just make sure the player’s name, country-side flag it’s very clear when the mouse is going over their units, as a tooltip. (as it is right now)\n\n4)Make a small form at the free bottom left corner of the screen accessible from the observer or the player during the game, where you can see always on top of your screen the current player names, side flags, colors, but most important group them by teams, for a fast and easy understanding of the current battle contentions.\n\n5)Make an option “Team color Selection” into the lobby when creating a game. Allow players to select to be in TEAM 1 (BLUE) TEAM 2 (RED) let them pick a color for their team and their units should be shown as this color when they choose to switch between “FoF” coloring mode in game.\nAny of those, standalone or as a combination or something like that could be used to help us enjoy more the OpenRA games.\nThanks for your time, and I hope you see how helpful and needed is Team Player Colors in OpenRA.\n\nRegards\nJohnnyXP64\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on
