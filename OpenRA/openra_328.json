20130915\nMod: RA\n\nImagine one of your teammates destroys a building which is covered by FoW.\nAs it is now, that building still remains visible to you.\nNow, if you got a bunch of units and order em to attack that bulding, they will MOVE to it's location instead (as there is nothing to attack anymore), and so they will move to their certain death right into the enemy's defenses, many times.\n\nThis is not a desirable behaviour and should be changed.\n\nMy advise is, prefer playability over realism in this case.\n(Many things in this game already follow this rule, a rifleman taking 10 bazooka-hits from a rocketman for example, which makes sense from a gameplay point of view but is not exactly realistic. But it's good the way it is!)\n\nSo, just make destroyed buildings disappear, so you know whats going on.\n\nThe exploration aspect is already very accentuated as you have to scout for new buildings, enemy units and as your units cannot shoot at what is not visible to them.\n\nAlso, even from a realism-point of view it's a 50/50 case:\nYes, if your units cannot see the building, they dont know if it is really destroyed.\nOn the other hand, they can hear (and perhaps even see) the explosion... the player sure can hear it.\n\nThe only \"realistic\" (for the other 50%) solution i could think of:\nUnits would endlessly continue firing at the building (assuming they dont know if it still exists), and you always would have to scout for every little peanuts.\nThat would be annoying as hell.\nAs units moving to their death is now.\n\nSolution: Just remove destroyed buildings from the map and we're fine.  :)\n\n<bountysource-plugin>\n\n---\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Place a

already wrote an http://old.d2kplus.com/wiki/index.php?title=Map_Files importer, but only published screenshots and then quickly vanished. http://forum.dune2k.com/topic/24184-opend2k-cross-platform-reimplementation-of-dune-2000/?p=375070 The problem is that Dune 2000 uses a 1x1 format. There are no pre-fabricated templates as in RA95 or C&C Gold and there has never been an official map editor. The fan made ones workaround this by defining their own set of templates, because it would otherwise be very annoying to make maps cell by cell. However these sets might conflict with the choices I made for our combined ARRAKIS tileset. Making deeper changes to arrakis.yaml will break the existing few maps we have. The easiest way would be to create BLOXBASE/BLOXBAT/BLOXWAST etc. legacy tilesets with bad usability in OpenRA.Editor.exe creating some ugly redundancy. Someone at http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=16009 also simply recreated the few popular Dune 2000 multiplayer maps manually.\n\n<bountysource-plugin>\n\n---\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Place a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/1351517-dune-2000-map-format-support?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4280","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4280/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4280/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4280/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4280","id":24059379,"number":4280,"title":"Dune 2000 MIS file import","user":{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":21104921,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Dune%202000","name":"Dune 2000","color":"EDC9AF","default":false},{"id":6382407,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"02d7e1","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"penev92","id":7137365,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7137365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92","html_url":"https://github.com/penev92","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"penev92","id":7137365,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7137365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92","html_url":"https://github.com/penev92","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2013-12-10T19:28:30Z","updated_at":"2015-02-26T19:34:42Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"Wished at http://forum.dune2k.com/topic/24184-opend2k-cross-platform-reimplementation-of-dune-2000/page-13#entry385338 I suggest to create some kind of legacy file import which parses the MIS file and then places some pre-fabricated trigger functions into the map.lua file.
