seems that the Spread logic works a bit different in between Release and Playtest. The Ion Cannon behaves differently, for example, even though its stats have not changed. It does not do as much damage to the communications centre now, and doesn't destroy it anymore. This difference only seems to apply to some buildings, not others. The buildings which are taller (3 cells tall) like the war factory and refinery seem unaffected. But buildings which are 2 cells tall receive far less damage now (e.g. landing strip, which is 4x2; comm. centre...).\n\nAlso, I haven't precisely measured it yet, but I think I have also noticed a slight difference in how ion cannon damage spreads across units. It seems slightly less powerful. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5119","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5119/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5119/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5119/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5119","id":31719324,"number":5119,"title":"Added smoke to the spice refineries","user":{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2014-04-17T11:23:33Z","updated_at":"2014-07-02T07:50:25Z","closed_at":"2014-05-14T10:20:27Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/5119","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5119","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5119.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5119.patch"},"body":"Found the sequence and tweaked the offset to fit:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/756669/2730943/a5afaa8c-c622-11e3-835f-9b7156c6b17d.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5119/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5118","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5118/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5118/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5118/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5118","id":31690420,"number":5118,"title":"unit upgrade building","user":{"login":"normannorman","id":5714681,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5714681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/normannorman","html_url":"https://github.com/normannorman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normannorman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normannorman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normannorman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normannorman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normannorman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normannorman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normannorman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normannorman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/normannorman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382420,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Idea/Wishlist","name":"Idea/Wishlist","color":"e102d8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-04-16T23:52:21Z","updated_at":"2014-12-30T00:50:20Z","closed_at":"2014-12-30T00:50:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"i think it would be awesome to be able to buy unit upgrades. for example + 2 speed for tanks or more ammo, hp or range etc. for other specific units. somebody like this idea and is able to add this function to openra??
