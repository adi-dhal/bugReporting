appears that muzzle flashes need very high Tick values for the first frame to show up at all, and even that doesn't help consistently (and it degrades how fluent the animation looks).\n\nFor example, if the muzzle has only 1 frame as in d2k, A tick value of 160 makes it show up roughly every second shot. At default it doesn't show at all.\n\nThe new muzzle in RA/C&C mod doesn't seem to display the first frame every time either, very rarely frame 2 appears to be skipped as well.

Additionally, this would make it easier for modders to add animations to any mod from other 2D C&C games without the need to convert them first.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/819321-palette-should-be-defineable-per-sequence?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3692/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3691","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3691/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3691/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3691/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/3691","id":18196790,"number":3691,"title":"Added the vehicle hijacker","user":{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2013-08-17T17:22:08Z","updated_at":"2014-06-25T15:10:51Z","closed_at":"2013-09-20T16:46:02Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/3691","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/3691","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/3691.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/3691.patch"},"body":"This is @ScottNZ's initial implementation discussed at #3272 rebased and I added owner checks to HackyAI.CleanSquads() and friends.
