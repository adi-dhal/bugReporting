I couldn't find the commit that was responsible for this regression, but this PR addresses that.\n\nI also made 'w' do less work if no units/classes are selected (no debug msg appears either)\n\nThe behavior now adheres to what's stated in the [wiki](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Hotkeys). Updated the line in settings to better represent what 'q' does.\n\nAlthough I incorrectly stated that it selects \"military units\" instead of \"highest priority\".\n\nDo you think 'q' should instead select \"military units\" ie a specific priority instead of simply the highest one?\n\nNote: this makes use of \"Game.debug()\" which might not be desirable. I could remove that or replace it with some placeholder (e.g. Game.WriteLine()) that calls Game.debug() until a better solution is available. I'm personally OK with leaving it as is (using Game.debug()).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9585/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9584","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9584/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9584/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9584/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9584","id":110791826,"number":9584,"title":"Fix

implements #8301 and parts of #2794.\n\nThe first commits implements the features, the second is a refactor to clarify the code, remove redundancies and make it easier to modify/add to in the future. It's also more explicit in its behavior, especially with regards to some functions that were being called from conditionals.\nBecause of the refactor, I recommend reviewing the commits separately.\n\nThe implemented keyboard hotkeys in the text areas are:\n- ctrl + left/right (navigate words) (cmd + left/right on osx)\n- ctrl + backspace/delete (backspaces/deletes words) (alt + backspace/delete on osx)\n- ctrl + u / ctrl + k (removes rest of line from cursor) (cmd backspace/delete on osx)\n- ctrl + x (clears the whole line) (cmd + x on osx) (this is optional but I often use it, especially in text editors)\n\nI don't have access to OSX, so someone has to test that it's working fine on OSX, and that the hotkeys are sane/expected behavior (coherent with how interface usually behaves in other apps/in the os)\n\nAlso, does home/end exist on OSX? should cmd + left/cmd + right behave like home/end instead? (edit: did the latter)\n\nA third commit resets the cursor blinking which I think makes the UX much better\nA fourth commit makes ctrl+x cut to clipboard instead of cutting to the ether.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9581","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9581/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9581/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9581/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9581","id":110738715,"number":9581,"title":"Gets

boring to play against passive creep, and too advanced to make Lua stuff\nThis would let mappers build a lot of cool maps, and give units/buildings to the AI to make it hard to play against them.\n\nExamples:\n*AI with only nukes, and you have to move quickly and have multiple bases\n*AI with only sea, but start with a lot of units\n*AI start with many units and mcv\n*fight between AI's and then winner vs player\netc..\n\nThe issues is also that many servers do not allow bots..
