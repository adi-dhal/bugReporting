can only be used on vehicles. The logic behind that is that infantry can not be teleported and those that are inside an APC die if that APC is teleported using chrono. But this logic is not consistent. All vehicles are operated by infantry. For example, sometimes after a tank is destroyed, the infantry inside survives and gets out. So when a tank is teleported, the infantry inside is also teleported without an issue. To make this consistent and also to enrich game tactics, chronosphere should have the ability to teleport infantry. \n\nBut this could make chronosphere a too powerful weapon because each square can hold five infantry and chronosphere teleports five squares which equals a maximum of 25 infantry. 25 Flamethrowers for example could be too overpowered and destroy significant amount of buildings. Actually even this could be an acceptable strategy since it is possible to prevent this by placing scattered artillery or V2 throughout the base. But if chronosphere would be deemed overpowered with this change, then its ability could be limited to five units instead of five squares. A different unit selection method would be required for this. And an APC with four infantry inside would count as five units. Or it could be extended to six units and a full APC could then be teleported.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4865/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4864","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4864/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4864/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4864/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/4864","id":29456701,"number":4864,"title":"Fixed husk flames","user":{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-03-14T17:55:58Z","updated_at":"2014-07-02T16:10:54Z","closed_at":"2014-03-14T21:38:30Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/4864","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/4864","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/4864.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/4864.patch"},"body":"for realsies now.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4864/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4863","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4863/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4863/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4863/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4863","id":29445928,"number":4863,"title":"Show country flags in front of player names in game lobby","user":{"login":"deniz1a","id":6599106,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6599106?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a","html_url":"https://github.com/deniz1a","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33149887,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Polish","name":"Polish","color":"FF9933","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-03-14T15:53:07Z","updated_at":"2016-01-14T18:12:22Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It would be better to immediately see where all the players are coming from.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue?

I was trying to parse one of them with a library and got a bunch of errors as a result. It looks like tabs for indentation are [not allowed](http://www.yaml.org/faq.html) by the yaml spec ([see section6.1](http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html)). Of course OpenRA doesn't have to completely follow the spec (and you can replace tabs with spaces before parsing), but it would be nice if it did for tool compatibility.\n\nFrom what I can tell, OpenRA uses [its own yaml parser class](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/master/OpenRA.FileFormats/MiniYaml.cs) so maybe that implementation only supports tabs or something.\n\nApologies if this is a duplicate, I couldn't find an existing discussion on this by searching the repo.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue?
