http://www.mediafire.com/listen/ic1ieq1lkl8p7dp/OpenRA.mp3\n\nI found out he has a YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/sbeast64\n\nWhat I like about this track (Hell March cover), in addition to being really good is that it's style fits well with the c&c soundtrack. The track is being offered freely. The appeal could be to reinforce the uniqueness of OpenRA's RA mod and the nature of it's voluntaryism. It could also encourage getting more valuable free offers from songwriters. Imagine having equally good, or better, unique tracks for all the mods (title music). If feasable, I feel this would be worthy of consideration.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9068","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9068/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9068/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9068/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9068","id":101008251,"number":9068,"title":"Crash

having some issues with running multiple servers on same users (Linux verified).\n\nIt seems on start the server writes the settings to settings.yaml in .openra/ directory.\n\nEarlier I've noticed a problem where the server name could actually be affected by this and duplicate, if the servers started up too fast (Sorted with adding a sleep in the script) - But I've experienced another \"worse\" problem now.\n\nEven though I'm starting my servers first, without any Server.Password, if I then start other servers, on the same user, but with Server.Password parameter, the first servers too, get locked (I guess it re-reads settings.yaml every now and then, and finds the Password-parameter).\n\nIs there any way to create a settings.yaml per server? Maybe settings-$PID.yaml if it's easy to get the PID on all OS'es.\n\nIt's very \"time consuming/waste\" to create own user for every server you might want to change the settings on.\n\nHope there's a solution to a more multi-setup friendly environment :)\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on

revealed in #9053.\nActor sight range is limited by the size of `Map.TilesByDistance`, which is defined as\n`static readonly CVec[][] TilesByDistance = InitTilesByDistance(MaxTilesInCircleRange);`.\nThis means that it is calculated once at game start and is the same for all maps.\n`Map.MaxTilesInCircleRange` is defined as `public const int MaxTilesInCircleRange = 50;`, which means there is effectively a hardcoded upper limit on the sight range one can put on an actor.\n\nTo be fair, `TilesByDistance`, which is used in `Map.FindTilesInAnnulus()` (only), is used for all kinds of stuff other than visibility as well, which means there is an upper limit of 50 cells for quite a few things.\n\n_P.S.: The actual limit for visibility is currently 49, because of_\n\n```\npublic static IEnumerable<PPos> ProjectedCellsInRange(Map map, WPos pos, WDist range)\n{\n    // Account for potential extra half-cell from odd-height terrain\n```\n\nThis can easily be changed to account for each map's size and adjust accordingly. That can be coupled with lint checks that would give proper warnings to modders and mappers about ranges that are too big. (there comes a point when the range is too big for the map).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9060","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9060/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9060/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9060/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9060","id":100871005,"number":9060,"title":"Add
