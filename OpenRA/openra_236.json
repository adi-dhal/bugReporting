This bug might be relevant to other SP missions as well, because it's likely objective evaluation is wrong.\n##### Objectives:\n- Find Einstein - primary - done\n- Tanya and Einstein must survive - primary - failed\n- Wait for the helicopter and extract Einstein - primary - failed\n- Protect all civilians - secondary - doesn't matter :)\n##### How to reproduce:\n\nOnce Einstein is on his way in the helicopter, get Tanya killed. This can be achieved by either leaving soldiers around or destroying only one power plant. Once allied destroyers arrive, they start destroying base. This will result in tesla coil being operational again.\n\nIt's very important to get Einstein in that helicopter. If you kill Tanya from the get go, mission will fail as expected. It's also noteworthy to say in game voice says _Mission failed_, but the mission summary says _Mission accomplished_ despite failed primary objectives as stated above.\n\n**Tags**: bug, RA,
