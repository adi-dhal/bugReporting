game regularly crashes after between 10 and 40 minutes of playing.\n\n**At the time of this crash, I was playing against Red Alert against 3 AIs.** In all the crashes I have experienced, I don't remember doing anything special in the moment before the crash.\n\n**I'm moving the cursor or clicking something, and then, suddenly, the screen freezes.** After a few seconds, (possibly only caused by me hitting Alt-Tab) the OSX beach ball appears.\n\nIn this last game, the one that generated the report below, there were a few laggy moments over the course of the game. All of those short lags lasted less than a second each. Then came the full freeze.\n\nHappy to provide additional information if necessary :)\n\n---\n\nRed Alert Mod at Version release-20131223\nOperating System: OSX (Unix 13.0.0.0)\nRuntime Version: Mono
