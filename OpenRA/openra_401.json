Now the fastest unit, to encourage hit and runs behind enemy lines on lightly armored units (e.g. artillery), infantry and wood buildings. \nBike - from 7.8 to 8.4.

Tank - from 7.2 to 5.6. I've tried differentiating the light tank and medium from one another; making medium slower is one way (they were set at identical speeds). Medium is still fast enough to break through places. Light tank has slightly less firepower (damage per second), but shoots fare more often, increasing odds of a hit. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2114","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2114/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2114/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2114/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/2114","id":4432793,"number":2114,"title":"cnc - made helicopter selection bounds a bit smaller","user":{"login":"psydev","id":1637812,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1637812?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev","html_url":"https://github.com/psydev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psydev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2012-05-04T23:11:17Z","updated_at":"2014-07-02T16:52:37Z","closed_at":"2012-05-06T07:58:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/2114","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/2114","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/2114.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/2114.patch"},"body":"Made smaller since they're so huge.
