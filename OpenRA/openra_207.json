is back.\n\nThe improves the speed of replay loading with several optimizations:\n- FieldLoader now caches some of the more expensive reflection calls, which speeds up loading.\n- ReplayBrowserLogic will now load replays on another thread so the UI doesn't block.\n- ReplayBrowserLogic will load replays in parallel. This means we can use all your cores to load all your replays.\n- If you had a lot of replays (we're talking hundreds to thousands), your framerate might drop significantly because it would have to draw so many items in the list, even the ones you couldn't see - I have made a change so it only draws the ones that are visible, which prevents the framerate tanking.\n\nFixes
