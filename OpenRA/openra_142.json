there are only two types of resources: \"cash\" and \"resources\". This should not be hardcoded and works badly with TS (which has veins), RA2 (which doesn't have resources), and AoE (which has several different primary types of resources), to name a few.\n\nThe obvious part of this work is to implement separate traits for each different type of resource, replacing `PlayerResources`, which may have different properties (to begin with, some resources must have capacities; some must not).\n\nThe other part of this is to implement RA/TD/D2K's behaviour of using resources to spend for cash. This should be implemented using a separate trait to indicate the two. There are two different proposed designs (note that the naming is tentative in both designs):\n\nThe first is to have an `ResourceAlias` trait which would implement the same abstract interface as a regular resource, but be implemented differently:\n\n```\nResourceAlias: ore-or-cash\n    Aliases: ore, cash\n```\n\nThis would simply be a resource which would link back into the others. Spending this resource would go in order of the `Aliases` array, so in this case, ore first, then cash.\n\nThe second is to have a `SubstituteResource` trait which would allow spending one resource in place of another:\n\n```\nSubstituteResource:\n    Use: ore\n    As: cash\n    Priority: 1\n```\n\nResources would be used in decreasing order of priority, so a positive priority indicates that ore would be used first; a negative priority would be used to spend ore only after cash was exhausted.\n\nFeedback on which design to use is appreciated.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this
