Also described in #2330\n\nIntroduces a new upgrade called `tesla`. Its consumers would be\n- `RequiresPower` that would disable itself (thus not necessitating power for proper functioning of the actor) when enough `tesla` upgrades  have been granted\n- `Armament` that would increase range, damage and reload speed and modify rendering for a juiced-up tesla coil\n\nNormally tesla coils would use these traits.\n\nThe upgrade's provider would be the `TeslaBoost` activity which requires the actor, that wishes to use this activity, to have the `GivesTeslaBoost` trait. Normally, tesla tanks and tesla troopers would use this trait.\n\nI've tried to make things flexible by allowing\n- the modders to decide whether or not `GivesTeslaBoost` activates the `TeslaBoost` when the units are idle in the vicinity of a receiving tesla coil\n- the player to force the tesla boost by explicitly giving an order to a tesla tank or tesla trooper to target a particular tesla coil\n- the `TeslaBoost` activity to be used with mobile units\n\n![untitled](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5747153/8380918/78835298-1c20-11e5-8a50-dbe2d0632432.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8562","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8562/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8562/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8562/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8562","id":91115776,"number":8562,"title":"Refactors the music player.","user":{"login":"GraionDilach","id":1136302,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1136302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach","html_url":"https://github.com/GraionDilach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/15","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestone/15","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/15/labels","id":1127295,"number":15,"title":"release-20150919","description":"","creator":{"login":"obrakmann","id":4331210,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4331210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann","html_url":"https://github.com/obrakmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":96,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-05-24T08:30:48Z","updated_at":"2015-12-24T15:13:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2015-09-20T11:23:40Z"},"comments":27,"created_at":"2015-06-26T00:49:57Z","updated_at":"2015-07-12T15:51:55Z","closed_at":"2015-07-12T15:45:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/8562","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8562","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8562.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8562.patch"},"body":"Proper fix for #8559.\nCloses  #8671, #8587 and #8033.\n\n<del>ATM it has one regression: due to the playlist getting set up before the shellmap's lua scripts, the game plays a maximum of two seconds maybe before the shellmap music at game start, depending on settings.

is more of a proposal than an issue. It's hard to explain in text, pardon if it's unclear...\n\nWhat if, instead of putting all the graphics on spritesheets, such as that of UIbits and other non-SHP graphics, make each individual graphic their own file?\n\nLooking at the UI chrome, there is a lot of picking out graphic WxH and X/Y values off of one sheet.\n\nOne downside I can think of to doing this is the extra memory and resources needed to manage every single graphic, but I think as far as modding goes, it is a lot more direct.\n\nFor example, the factions played, right now, can share the same infantry/vehicle/aircraft/etc icons off of the same sheet. I can even make separate sheets for the factions. To label each of those icons on the team's chrome, I'd refer to a coordinate on the sheet, and a specific width/height amount of pixels for it to fit.\n\nUsing individual graphics files, I can either select the very one I'll draw onto, or if I want to resize it for a custom UI, I can, and in a Trait, point out which file I want to use, and its width/height.\n\nSo, if I want a different icon for each team, I make another graphic of that icon, relabel both the file and the Trait definition in the chrome, and it will read specifically the image.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8551","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8551/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8551/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8551/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8551","id":90482270,"number":8551,"title":"Starting spec","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382420,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Idea/Wishlist","name":"Idea/Wishlist","color":"e102d8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2015-06-23T20:22:20Z","updated_at":"2015-11-22T21:56:03Z","closed_at":"2015-11-22T21:56:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It would be nice for new players and vets alike to have a 10s spec at the start of the match to see the map and chat with players. \n\nAs a toggleable option (enabled by default) a match starts paused with the entire map revealed.

like `Map.ActorsInBox(Map.TopLeft, Map.BottomRight, function(self) ... end)` are used through most of our map scripts as a method of finding the actors in a map that match an arbitrary filter.\n\nThis is bogus for two reasons:\n- It abuses an API designed for one thing (finding the actors within a specific part of the map) to do something something completely different (finding all the actors on the map matching a condition).  This is a design smell.\n- It doesn't work in TS or RA2 (or any other mods that decide to use terrain height).  The top and bottom edges of the map are not lines of constant WPos.Y, and so you will miss actors near the top of the map if they are at a lower elevation than the top-left cell, and miss actors at the bottom edge of the map if they are at a higher elevation than the bottom-right cell.\n- (bonus point) The implementation of `.TopLeft` and `.BottomRight` is basically completely bogus, and returns the wrong points for isometric maps.  We can fix this at least, but its not clear whether these positions are actually useful to scripters after we fix the above two points.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a

You can see that for example harvester remains same, facing down, while the units near the wall completely change direction left to right, and those facing SW now face SE and reverse.\n\n![openra

issue I am facing is twofold.\n\n(a) First, when launched (on _Ubuntu_) with a Lithuanian keyboard layout, which I use as a default, OpenRA does not allow me to make use of the Ctrl–# unit selection shortcuts. This is because the layout in question, in contrast to the en-US layout, has letters (like ąčęėšųūž) on the digit-key row. Other keyboard shortcuts (W, R, Ctrl-X and so on) work fine – probably because the lt-LT layout has no other special characters aside from the digit-key row.\n\nIt could be noted that changing the layout (via a keyboard shortcut) while in game does not work, for OpenRA just stops responding.\n\n(b) This leads to my second issue. Namely, when one launches the games with the layout now changed to the international en-US, one finds Ctrl–# shortcuts working just fine. However, the problem is that the other keyboard shortcuts have stopped working, i.e. W, R, D, G, Ctrl-X and many others. Fixing it requires manual key reassignment, which leads to some keycodes being shown instead of the proper keys, i.e. '1074' instead of 'W' and '1086' instead of R, and so on. Once reassigned, the keys work fine; this is very annoying, though.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/22736903-ctrl-shortcuts-are-not-keyboard-layout-agnostic?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8541","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8541/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8541/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8541/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8541","id":90092029,"number":8541,"title":"Selected across map in replay","user":{"login":"Snurre86","id":7798635,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7798635?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Snurre86","html_url":"https://github.com/Snurre86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Snurre86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Snurre86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Snurre86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Snurre86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Snurre86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Snurre86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Snurre86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Snurre86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Snurre86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":124120259,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/UI","name":"UI","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2015-06-22T13:00:24Z","updated_at":"2016-01-11T14:12:29Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Add the ability to double click or \"w\" to select all units by type in replay (with different shroud settings).
