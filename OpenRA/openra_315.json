The unit's driver is actually the mechanic, and maybe it should eject them on death, or not at all.\n- Hijackers - if a unit becomes hijacked the original driver is technically dead - this is the same situation as a Mechanic, an E1 may still be ejected.\n\nWe could pull `PilotActor` out of `EjectOnDeath` and make a separate `Driver` trait. When the unit is captured or hijacked then the driver/actor reference would be updated. This also ties in a bit to renegade-style gameplay, or sniping drivers out of vehicles (Generals/Jarmen Kell).\n\nOr we could somehow make Cargo support driver units as well (this might be the cleanest).\n\nPchote also mentioned showing art/badges on units with a different driver, so you know what can eject.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on
