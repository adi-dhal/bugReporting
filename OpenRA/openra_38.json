It occurs very frequently when AI builds many harvesters. After this fix, I never saw AI harvester getting stuck. I only verified it with AIs so I'm not sure if this fixes issues with ally harvesters. (but probably will)\r\n- Also, harvesters can get stuck when trying to harvest a tib/ore patch underneath a friendly unit. Especially true when AI has a rally point set on ore. Harvester will not mine until the unit is removed for its use as attacking force. I don't think Notifying blocker is a good solution as they might be standing there to protect the harvesters. In this fix, harvesters take such cells as un-harvestable cell.\r\n\r\n- This is the behavior of RA1 and CNC1 harvesters. I can make units stand on tib patch so that the tib patch underneath will start growing and eventually spread to adjacent cells., effectively making the units my own blossom tree
