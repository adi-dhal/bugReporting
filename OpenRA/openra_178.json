attempt to make inter-trait handling more robust and add information to trait docs.\n\nInter-Trait Handling Part 1: #8785.\n\nInter-Trait Handling Parts 2 & 3:\n- `InitializeAfter<Trait>`, `RequiresSingleton<Trait>`, `Uses<Trait>`, and `Requires<Trait>` Split (In progress)\n  - `InitializeAfter<Trait>` if `.Trait[OrDefault]<T>` or the like is called in trait constructor.\n  - `Uses<Trait>` if trait uses other but does not cache it. (for trait docs)\n  - `Requires<Trait>` if trait requires other but does not cache it.\n  - `RequiresSingleton<SingletonTrait>` if SingletonTrait is required.\n- `IMultipleTraitInfo` or `IManyTraitInfo`\n  - Allow multiple instances of trait only if it implements `IMultipleTraitInfo`\n  - Add multiplicity information to trait docs including singleton trait interfaces dropping the `I` in front and `TraitInfo` at the end.\n\nInter-Trait Handling Parts 4+:\n- Change `INotifyCreated.Create(Actor self)` to `INotifyCreated<T>.Create(T obj)`\n  - This will allow more complex interaction with `UpgradeManager` such as changing upgrades and responding to upgrade changes.\n    - This would allow for more complex condition/upgrade expressions.\n  - This will allow more complex interactions than simple caching.\n- Add `CachedTrait<Trait>` to provide better handing and error messages than using `Lazy<Trait>`.\n- ~~Support inter-trait caching similar to the way `FieldLoader` works.~~\n  - ~~`[ActorInitializor.Ignore]`, `[ActorInitializor.Single[OrDefault]]`, `[ActorInitializor.First[OrDefault]]`, and `[ActorInitializor.Many/Multiple]`.~~\n- Remove `Lazy<Trait>` and other tricks that may cause problems based on trait construction order using the above.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on

introduces a new coordinate system (\"projected map cells\", or `PPos`) for code that deals with the map border and shroud.  For mods that don't use terrain height `PPos` maps identically to `MPos`.\n\nFrom the first commit message:\n\n```\nPPos is best thought of as a cell grid applied in\nscreen space.  Multiple cells with different\nterrain heights may be projected to the same PPos,\nor to multiple PPos if they do not align with the\nscreen grid (i.e. odd-height or sloped).\n\nPPos coordinates are used primarily for map edge\nchecks and shroud / visibility queries.\n```\n\nFor the sake of keeping the PR as reviewable as possible I have limited this to what we need for the shroud.  Future PRs will deal with the map-edge coordinate helpers which are fiddly and harder to review.\n\nExpected behaviour with this PR applied is for there to be no visible changes in TD/RA/D2K, and for the TS shroud rendering to behave logically.  Edge of map behaviour in TS should be no worse than in current bleed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8780","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8780/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8780/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8780/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8780","id":97228775,"number":8780,"title":"Crates are not collectable in TS","user":{"login":"pchote","id":167819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/167819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote","html_url":"https://github.com/pchote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":117791539,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Regression","name":"Regression","color":"e11d21","default":false},{"id":41025558,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Tiberian%20Sun","name":"Tiberian Sun","color":"eb6420","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-07-25T14:05:13Z","updated_at":"2015-08-01T16:54:39Z","closed_at":"2015-08-01T16:54:31Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Introduced by https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8339/files#diff-8e8bb64e0c97a0eb2f07e03046a5628fR67.
