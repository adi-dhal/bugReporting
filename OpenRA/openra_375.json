Furthermore, it takes much longer for it to do this than its Soviet equivalent the MiG. Now that MiGs are getting AA capabilities in addition, something needs to be done.\n\nThese are my proposed improvements, though I welcome others. Note that I am suggesting all of these improvements be implemented, not just some:\n\n1: Reduce their build times by 25% to 36 seconds down from 48 seconds. \n2: Reduce their reload times to 0.5 per rocket down from 1 second per rocket. It is insane that it takes 8 full seconds to reload these things from empty! \n3: Reduce their cost by 25% to 1500 down from 2000 \n4: Increase their rocket damage vs tanks/heavy armour by 50%. This would allow it to destroy a single Medium Tank while at full rocket capacity (they presently take 12 rockets to destroy).\n\n<bountysource-plugin>\n\n---\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Place a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/136879-improve-longbows-balancing?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2893/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2892","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2892/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2892/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2892/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2892","id":12620131,"number":2892,"title":"Fix Allied Mobile AA (Balancing)","user":{"login":"Surrealistik","id":3922788,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3922788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Surrealistik","html_url":"https://github.com/Surrealistik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Surrealistik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Surrealistik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Surrealistik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Surrealistik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Surrealistik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Surrealistik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Surrealistik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Surrealistik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Surrealistik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":21103452,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Balancing","name":"Balancing","color":"DDDDDD","default":false},{"id":21877809,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Red%20Alert","name":"Red Alert","color":"8B0000","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2013-03-29T21:47:21Z","updated_at":"2015-11-22T01:49:52Z","closed_at":"2015-11-22T01:49:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Just a repost really of issues discussed on Sleipnir's forum here:\n\nhttp://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=82&t=16183\n\nSummary: Allies have no viable mobile anti-air.

patches introduce a new set of coordinates for representing position and orientation, and uses them to implement a much better system for positioning turrets and muzzles.\n\nKey changes:\n- New types for representing 3d types and rotations without requiring any floating point math.\n- Turrets and weapons understand arbitrary 3d rotations, not just facing.\n- Muzzles are now affected by recoil.\n- Clearer yaml definitions for positioning turrets/muzzles (forward,right,up relative to body).\n- Includes a debug layer for displaying the muzzle positions (might finally encourage someone to set them properly).\n- Lays the foundations for voxels and TS/RA2 support.\n\nI've tested this with RA, C&C, and my voxel test mod and I'm pretty sure I've covered all the edge cases. I have left rotors/spinners/etc with the old positioning for now, as these are better solved as part of #2841.\n\nIt will be straightforward from here to start fixing the coordinate-system mess and the rest of the combat code, but that should wait until these changes have been proven stable.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2887/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2886","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2886/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2886/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2886/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/2886","id":12598203,"number":2886,"title":"Added

It will give you the power down cursor instead.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2883/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2882","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2882/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2882/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2882/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2882","id":12579184,"number":2882,"title":"Customizable unit \"hitbox\"","user":{"login":"reaperrr","id":2857877,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2857877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperrr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382420,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Idea/Wishlist","name":"Idea/Wishlist","color":"e102d8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-03-28T19:01:51Z","updated_at":"2013-05-20T00:49:04Z","closed_at":"2013-05-20T00:49:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"One thing that has ALWAYS annoyed me about WW's C&C games was that to the engine, the (visual) size of the unit didn't matter at all when applying the warheads' spread value. It would be far more logical if an AP shell hitting 8 pixels from the target center would still do full damage to a mammoth tank, but zero damage to a nearby infantry.\n\nAs I'm not a programmer I'm not sure how to best implement something like that.\n\nMy idea would be a Size tag, where 1 = 1 pixel hitbox (default), 2 = 3x3, 3 = 5x5 and so on (I assume 2x2 and the likes are problematic since they don't have a pixel at the center, but maybe I'm wrong). Now the Spread value would take the outer bound of this hitbox instead of the center pixel for damage calculation, making a mammoth with size 8 and speed 8 easier to hit than a heavy tank at speed 7 and size 5, for example. .\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2881","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2881/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2881/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2881/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/2881","id":12572591,"number":2881,"title":"Hotfix: C&C classic don't crash on game start","user":{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2013-03-28T16:33:14Z","updated_at":"2014-07-02T16:43:13Z","closed_at":"2013-03-28T16:36:17Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/2881","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/2881","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/2881.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/2881.patch"},"body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2881/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2880","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2880/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2880/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2880/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2880","id":12566801,"number":2880,"title":"Can't watch single-player replays anymore","user":{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382400,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"d7e102","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-03-28T14:32:50Z","updated_at":"2013-04-12T20:49:00Z","closed_at":"2013-04-12T20:49:00Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"They will pause forever and can't be unpaused.
