Background\r\n\r\nThe core motivation of OpenRA is to be a set of games on a shared engine that improve on the classic C&C titles both as games and as a modding platform.  Having a shared engine that runs packaged mods (first or third party) actively sabotages these goals, and IMO is no longer sustainable.\r\n\r\nThere are two main reasons for this:\r\n#### (lack of) Mod support\r\n\r\nMods are slaves to whatever engine version the player has installed, and we break the whole platform on every new OpenRA release.  This sucks for players who lose access to their thirdparty mods (e.g. [crossfire](http://www.moddb.com/mods/openra-crossfire) or [TDX](http://ppmforums.com/viewtopic.php?t=42524) which are based on outdated releases), it sucks for modders who are forced to update their mods on *our* schedule instead of theirs, and it sucks for us because modders give up and abandon their mods because this requirement is not fair or sustainable.\r\n\r\nOn the technical side, for all our flexibility there are still far too many cases where customizing something basic means either begging for upstream changes (e.g. #11813, #11830) or duplicating and renaming huge chunks of the Mods.Common logic.\r\n\r\nWe put a lot of effort into building out a framework for oramod support, but this doesn't solve the main problems faced by non-trivial mods.  They either distribute a copy of the OpenRA repository with their own changes (Shattered Paradise, Crystallized Doom, Attacque Supérior, Rewire, etc) or fall apart ([*cough*](https://github.com/OpenRA/ra2/)).\r\n\r\nOn the player side, we have people writing scripts to [circumvent the oramod packaging](https://www.reddit.com/r/openra/comments/5l9lsz/script_to_easily_installuninstall_openra_mods_on/), and complaints about how annoying it is to switch between even our own playtest vs release mod versions.\r\n\r\n#### Branding confusion\r\n\r\nOut of all the feedback on our new logo design, the main underlying complaint seems to be that players don't want some generic icon on their launcher, they want something that they can identify with the mod(s) that they play.  I can't fault this argument, but this is incompatible with our goal/requirement for our project-neutral launcher to have a project-neutral icon.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nThe only way I can see to solve these problems is to change from a shared engine + dependent mods to fully self-contained mods.  This is mainly a packaging exercise – I am not proposing to split [OpenRA/OpenRA](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA) into multiple repositories (that would make it impossible to test engine PRs) or to offer individual installers for our official mods.\r\n\r\nThe repository layout (and running the development versions) would stay the same, but the packaging scripts would separate out the different mods into something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<prefix>/\r\n         ra-release-xxxx/\r\n                         OpenRA.Game.exe\r\n                         (other shared files)\r\n                         mods/\r\n                              common/\r\n                                     (common files)\r\n                              ra/\r\n                                 (ra files)\r\n                              ra-content/\r\n                                         (ra content manager files)\r\n         cnc-release-xxxx/\r\n                          OpenRA.Game.exe\r\n                          (other shared files)\r\n                          mods/\r\n                               common/\r\n                                      (common files)\r\n                               cnc/\r\n                                   (TD files)\r\n                               cnc-content/\r\n                                           (TD content manager files)\r\n          (and so on)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn OSX each mod would have its own .app bundle, and on Windows/Linux they would get their own launcher shortcut (yes, this is returning to our pre-2012 packaging standards).  The launchers would use the mods's own name and own logo.\r\n\r\nThe ingame modchooser mod would be dropped, so would oramods, support dir mod loading, and runtime mod dependencies.  The horrible filesystem behaviour on Windows means that we can't merge the content installer into the main mod, so we'd need each to ship its own content manager (replacing the `Mods` button in the menu with `Manage Content`).  It sucks to move away from the shared UI that I developed for this, but at least we will be reusing the same backend code this time.  It also means that mods that ship all their own assets can completely opt out of the content manager.\r\n\r\nThird party mods would then be free to target whatever engine version they want, including their own custom versions if they want to include changes that aren't/won't be merged upstream.  The downside here is that they will need to provide their own OS-specific packaging, but this is something that the big mods are *already* doing.\r\n\r\nHaving a shared multiplayer server list with the ability to switch mods on the fly is one of OpenRA's best features, so we need a way for mods to register themselves and launch other mods.  We can solve this by having the platform launchers pass a Launch.Launcher argument to the game exe that defines the platform specific command to run that mod and join a server.  The game writes this to a metadata file in the support directory, and mods read these files to populate the Game.Mods data.  The awesome thing here is that players will be able to switch between playtest and release versions of the same mod in exactly the same way that they switch between different mods.\r\n\r\n### Other issues / drawbacks:\r\n\r\n* The explicit mod registration means that players need to manually launch a mod at least once before it can be switched to from the MP lobby.\r\n\r\n* We would have to remove support for the orarep file type handler, and the either remove or change the openra:// uri handler to something like openra-&lt;mod&gt;-&lt;version&gt;://.\r\n\r\n* ~~The directory layout of development versions would be fundamentally different to packaged versions, which will cause bugs.~~ Hopefully largely solved, see my update below.\r\n\r\n* ~~Some people (who don't care about the reason for this change) will be very unhappy about the file duplication.~~ Hopefully largely solved, see my update below.\r\n\r\nThis is a big change, so it needs thought and input before we decide whether to move forward with it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12554/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":3,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12553","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12553/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12553/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12553/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12553","id":199369129,"number":12553,"title":"Fatal

suitable effect module.\r\nCandidates are\r\n\r\n* RenderDetectionCircle : To use this I need to make the Iron curtain a detector.\r\n* RenderJammerCircle : Iron curtain will become a radar jammer\r\n* RenderShroudCircle : IC needs to be a shroud generator\r\n* RenderRangeCircle : Most side-effect-less choice, as I can give the iron curtain a damageless weapon. However, it still has glitches as the player can select the structure and issue an attack order.\r\n\r\nI think there should be a more generic RenderCircle option.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12538","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12538/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12538/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12538/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12538","id":198410278,"number":12538,"title":"Upgrade ra2 mod error -

With a longer build time they fall prey to mass numbers.)\r\n\r\nion time increase from 3:00 to 4:30.\r\n(Ion strikes go off a little to fast. Mammoth armies take about 2:00 to build back up. By the time base attacks happen close to 3:00)\r\n\r\nnuke timer from 5 to 6.\r\n(Because the nuke damage has been buffed)\r\n\r\nnuke damage spread fallout increased from 1000, 368, 135, 50, 18, 7, 0\r\nto 1000, 700, 500, 300, 150, 50, 0\r\n(Nuke damage spread was to weak. Barely killing a power plant where it lands just a few cells away from base hit)\r\n\r\nnuke spread damage increased from 100 to 110. (First spread modifier)\r\n(See line above)\r\n\r\na10 timer increased from 3:30 to 4:00.\r\n(Timer increased because they were going off a little to fast still. These planes kill infantry builds as it is.)\r\n\r\nMSAM HP from 120 to 180.\r\n(To weak vs air. Missiles drain takes a few seconds to reload and then sniped within that time. Specially since dedicated AA)\r\n\r\nCommando weapon range increased from 6c0 to 8c0.\r\n(They had the same range as e3 and minigunners were able to close distances on them extremely fast. Take note they shoot farther then their vision range.)\r\n\r\nCommando weapon projectile speed increased from 1c682 to 5c682.\r\n(This was super annoying. You fire a shot and the infantry doesn't die because bullet travel to slow. Increased this fixed the problem.)\r\n\r\nCommando price increase from 1000 to 2000.\r\n(Extremely cheap when buffed. Increased price to match their power.)\r\n\r\nCommando build time increased from 24 to 32. (2000 Build duration)\r\n(Build time a little to fast. Compensates this with multiple barracks.)\r\n\r\nHusks interval timer increased from 2 to 6.\r\n(Husks blow up to fast to capture anything. Kept on low timer to prevent vehicle block. Only possible way is to have an engineer in an APC ready. Which Nod is unable to have APCs.)\r\n\r\nBike damage increase from 30 to 31.\r\n(HP changes on harvs, structures, and mammoth. A very small change leading to a decent buff. Granting a 2 damage increase with constant hits)\r\n\r\nChem damage vs none reduced from 100 to 70.\r\n(Chems performing a little to well by themselves. Having mixed units is a better solution. IE: My recent flame tank chem trooper mix)\r\n\r\nChem damage vs armor increased from 50 to 75.\r\n(Chems performed a little to weak vs armor. Doing less damage then infantry and getting squashed by medium tanks and light tanks. This will make players think twice about squashing tactics. Also more damage vs armored defenses.)\r\n\r\nGrenadier accuracy reduced from 213 to 813. (Makes them miss a lot more).\r\n(Grenadiers were to accurate and unable to kill infantry packs. Looking at CNC95 and RA in ORA they miss their targets as well. Having them miss spreads their AoE damage and able to take out infantry packs. Players maye want to think of spreading infantry when fighting grenadiers)\r\n\r\nFlamer damage vs armor reduced from 20 to 10. (Flame infantry)\r\n(To much damage to APCs and light tanks)\r\n\r\nFlamer damage vs none increased from 100 to 110. (Flame infantry.)\r\n(Made them stronger vs infantry to balance out vs chems. Makes them a strong viable choice.)\r\n\r\nHarv build timer increase from 24 to 27. (1680 build timer)\r\n(Harv spamming is like a disease. Its gotten to strong to quickly. Increasing their timer slightly also increases other viable builds.)\r\n\r\nHarvester HP increase from 600 to 625.\r\n(Both medium tanks and bikes doing a little to much damage. Compensates slightly for build timer)\r\n\r\nRefinery power reduced from 50 to 40.\r\n(Offers more build choices. Opening barracks becomes stronger then going strip/factory all the time. Both openings strong strats just requires scouting.)\r\n\r\nRefinery sell no longer refunds.\r\n(Includes with the harv spamming. Gave 250 back which counted towards buggy/bike money. IE: PP > Ref > Strip (Strip makes 2-3 buggies 2 bikes then a harv) > Ref (Sell ref gain harv) > Strip (Because power only 30) > PP\r\n\r\nRefinery tiberium hold reduced from 2000 to 700.\r\n(This has had no impact to force people to build silos. But it opts people to protect refineries rather then \"Lost a ref. Meh. Got 3 others.\". Losing a ref now loses earned money. If it holds money. Also prevents sell trick to save power.)\r\n\r\nSilo hold increase from 2000 to 3000.\r\n(Compensate for Refinery. Also has extra HP now. See below.)\r\n\r\nAGT HP from 600 to 550.\r\n(Way to strong when it came to units coming to these in mass amounts. Also hard for artillery units to shell due to small box size and HP pool.)\r\n\r\nLight Tank price reduced from 700 to 650.\r\n(700 was a bit to high. 650 seems to hit the right spot but left build time as is. 0:17)\r\n\r\nVisceroid spawn reduce from 10 to 5.\r\n(This was a weird one. Infantry dieing in tiberium was at a good spot. But for some reason when chems kill infantry it would create 2-3 visceroids. Then those visceroids would create 2-3 at a time. RNG issue so was reduced.)\r\n\r\nIncrease all building HP by 100.\r\n(Help balance vs medium tanks, bikes, light tanks, chems, grenadiers, air units, and stealth tanks.)\r\n\r\nGun turret HP increase from 400 to 410.\r\n(This is taking baby steps. I want them a little tougher vs medium tanks but not at the point of RA style. Same logic as obrakmann taking baby steps with MCV.)\r\n\r\nStarting units adjusted.\r\n(This created a big problem in competitive scenes. Having early units is good to prevent infantry rushes. But starting with a bike/apc while your opponent starts with a hummer/buggy is to off balancing.)\r\n\r\nMCV build time decreased from 1:36 to 1:00. (3750)\r\n(Price unchanged. Takes a little to long in team games and some 1v1 scenarios to get one built. Also now drains money faster to compensate)\r\n\r\nEngineer HP increase from 25 to 30.\r\n(Dies a little to quick hummers/buggies. Same kill time as minigunner (If takes a hit while standing)\r\n\r\nAPC HP increase from 210 to 215.\r\n(These are dieing a little to fast and weak vs certian units. IE: buggies/hummers and bikes. Tested vs light tanks and more optimal. Baby steps.)\r\n\r\nAPC Damage vs light decreased from 105 to 100.\r\n(I don't want them killing bikes to fast now that they are cheaper.)\r\n\r\nAPC cost decreased from 600 to 550.\r\n(APCs for infantry builds as GDI was waaaaay to expensive. Having a slightly faster build timer of 0:14 instead of 0:15 will help too. Helps to withstand early onslaught of Nod. Keep note bikes still 0:12 timer)\r\n\r\n(Created new Sam weapon Dragon from RA e3 AA. Reason: Shared weapon with AGT.)\r\n\r\nSamsite range increased from 8c0 to 12c0.\r\n(Dedicated AA. Keep note: Longer range = longer time to kill a unit and able to escape. Closer it is the faster air units die.)\r\n\r\nSamsite spread damage decreased from 682 to 128.\r\n(To much AoE damage)\r\n\r\nSamsite range limit increased from 9c614 to 15co.\r\n(Missiles would die out within its own range circle.)\r\n\r\nSamsite reveal shroud decreased from 8c0 to 6c0.\r\n(Prevents the RA logic of build an AA in front of your base and all good. You need units/structures to make good use of its range.)\r\n\r\nSamsite now fires two shots at a time.\r\n(Increases damage and intuitive to home base of CNC95.)\r\n\r\nRecon Bike HP decreased from 120 to 110.\r\n(Takes to long to kill these units when vs minigunners and light vehicle types. APCs taking to long to kill these.)\r\n\r\nAirstrip/Weapon Factory power increased from 30 to 50.\r\n(Increased like a disease. Nod players going with an extremely fast 4 strip build without com center. GDI maxing at 3 factories with non stop vehicles. Infantry became to weak.)\r\n\r\nCommunication Center power increased from 40 to 50.\r\n(See above.)\r\n\r\nAPC movement speed increased from 128 to 132.\r\n(A little to slow vs light tanks and dealing with buggies. Buggies being faster still they are able to get a few extra shots off. Provides better base entry.)\r\n\r\nMRLS range reduced from 12c0 to 11c0.\r\n(Out ranging Nod artillery. Extremely accurate as is and to strong vs several units. Shorter range allows faster vehicles to reach them better.)\r\n\r\nMRLS damage vs none reduced from 35 to 25.\r\n(To much damage vs infantry. Specially to e3.)\r\n\r\nObelisk power reduced from 150 to 90.\r\n(Having to build an adv power plant after each Obelisk is put up is insane. Two Obelisk = 180 now and adv power plant is 200.)\r\n\r\nPulled from https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12507 rebasing didn't work. Was also deleted contemplating time.
