problem in ra2 mod is the Kirov Airship, In ra2, Westwood makes a new kind of aircraft, it is the Kirov Airship, the Kirov will throw the bombs to enemy units directly not like the Aircraft in OpenRA, it is not like the AttackBomber either.\r\nIn ra2 mod, we use Aircraft to describe the Kirov, but it is not enough, so we need a new trait to describe the Kirov \r\nYes, there is no Airship in original OpenRA, but i think we need to give support to the people who want to create something like Kirov\r\n\r\nOf course, we can give more options to make people implemt their own style Airship, not only Kirov, it can be

traits in Mods.Common are not inheritable.\r\nFor example, I've been trying to create Marvest trait from Harvester trait.\r\nThey will share most of the code except I only have to remove docking behavior.\r\n\r\nOne way is to copy paste the whole Harvester.cs to make a separate MarvesterInfo and Marvester Trait class. Then, I run into trouble: I have to copy whole FindResources.cs in activities, as it requires Harvester trait and HarvesterInfo and any other stuff that reference Harvester trait.\r\n\r\nModders will then decide and inherit HarvesterInfo into MarvesterInfo so they can take advantage of implemented FindResources.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this decision is that when I inherit HarvesterInfo like this,\r\n\r\n\tpublic class OreTeleportHarvesterInfo : HarvesterInfo\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t**new** public object Create(ActorInitializer init) { return new OreTeleportHarvester(init.Self, this); }\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nthe new Create() function never gets run.\r\n\r\n\tpublic OreTeleportHarvester(Actor self, OreTeleportHarvesterInfo info)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tInfo = info;\r\n\t\t\tmobile = self.Trait<Mobile>();\r\n\t\t\tGame.Debug(\"MARV has arrived\");\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\nThis can be verified by putting a debug message.\r\n\r\nThroughout modding this occurs very often.\r\nIt happened to me before when I tried to implement SharedCargo from Cargo trait:
