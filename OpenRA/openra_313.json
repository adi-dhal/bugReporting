Apache has 5 rounds in its magazine.\nThe Apacheâ€™s reload timer begins after firing the 1st rounds.\nWhen the reload timer hits 0, all 5 rounds are refilled.\n\nUsually, this results in the Apache firing 5 rounds in a row, and then after a brief downtime, it can fire another 5 rounds in a row.\n\nHowever, if I fire the 1st round, wait for some time, and then fire the 4 remaining rounds, the reload will occur right after I use up the 4 remaining rounds, giving me 5 fresh rounds. This lets me fire 9 shots in a row.\n\nI recommend either:\nA) If the Apache fires its weapon when the reload timer is counting down, the reload will be interrupted, and the reload timer will be reset.\nB) Make the Apache reload like the Orca: a little bit of ammo at a time, instead of an instant full reload at the end of a timer.\n\nPS:\n\nThere also seems to be another bug, and I don't know if it is related: when trying to figure out exactly how long it takes for the apache to reload, it seems that the reload time is random. It always takes somewhere between 0 to 8 seconds to reload. This is weird, and reload time certainly shouldnâ€™t be random.\n\nAfter the 1st reload, the time between the 1st reload and the 2nd reload is always approximately 8 seconds. Only this part is consistent. \n\nPSS:\n\nI have confirmed that the Orca has the same reload time inconsistency problem. The Orca carries 6 missiles, and replenishes 2 missiles on every reload. \n\nThe time between the 1st round fired and the 1st reload is random, and seems to be between 0 to 8 seconds. \n\nSometimes, the reload is nearly instant, effectively allowing the Orca to fire 8 missiles in a row. Sometimes, after 6 missiles are fired, there is delay before the next 2 missiles can be fired.\n\nAfter the 1st reload, the time between the 1st reload and the 2nd reload is again, always approximately 8 seconds. Only this part is consistent. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4755/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4754","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4754/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4754/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4754/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4754","id":28555375,"number":4754,"title":"Own destroyed building visible through the darkness","user":{"login":"Temeez","id":3135774,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3135774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Temeez","html_url":"https://github.com/Temeez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Temeez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Temeez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Temeez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Temeez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Temeez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Temeez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Temeez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Temeez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Temeez/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33149887,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Polish","name":"Polish","color":"FF9933","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2014-03-01T11:28:23Z","updated_at":"2015-11-22T13:00:25Z","closed_at":"2015-11-22T13:00:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am fairly sure that airfield was the last one get destroyed.\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/gpzg5c6kzc8f7ho/OpenRA.Game%202014-02-27%2021-41-37-819.png\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4754/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4753","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4753/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4753/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4753/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4753","id":28552620,"number":4753,"title":"Investigate decreasing the default tick rate","user":{"login":"pchote","id":167819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/167819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote","html_url":"https://github.com/pchote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382530,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Performance","name":"Performance","color":"02e10c","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2014-03-01T07:46:22Z","updated_at":"2016-02-25T08:34:40Z","closed_at":"2015-11-22T12:14:29Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Decreasing the tick rate from 25 ticks per second to 10 would reduce the network and CPU requirements by 60%.

This way we could only let the server save replays, and not have to rely on people remembering to upload the replays. The reason I mention this is because of the added features mentioned in #4716. If production queue data is sent to clients, it would be easy to cheat. But if the server is the only one that knows it, then less so.\nWe could also add a feature to see more about who you are playing against, if they have a profile. This could also be used in replays.\n\nWith this feature players can also have friends list, which would help them keep track of which of their friends are online, and we could add chat features.\nWe can also better keep track of who is online, and have a \"LFG\" kind of thing.\n\nThese are just the ideas I could come up with.
