I am using Grant external condition to stack levels of a condition on actors, when they reach the max level possible by the condition, something fancy happens (kudos because this wasn't possible with the upgrade system), in this case your guys will be able to fire a final projectile that has the change onwer warhead.\r\n\r\nThe issue here is that the External Conditions trait crashes if I don't give every single condition a clear use, like what you can see here for example, I am forced to use the level conditions for dummy multipliers, if I remove a single range multiplier, then the game will crash after the first BoardingPod projectile reaches it's target.\r\n\r\nThe exception is below the template

of a fixed `TargetExtraSearchRadius` that is added unconditionally, all affected warheads and projectiles now look up the rules for the largest health shape, and add exactly that value by default (the old, static behaviour can still be enforced by setting a custom override value).\r\n\r\nThis way, modders don't have to find and set an optimal value themselves.\r\n\r\nAs an example how much this can help performance during heated battles, launch the RA mod, build 50 flamethrowers and make them shoot at the exact same time, on bleed and on this branch. The lag spike on the performance graph should be nearly 3 times as high on bleed vs. this PR, because the projectile is `Blockable` and the largest outer health radius in RA is only `543 WDist` (compared to the old default overscan of `1536`).\r\n\r\nCloses
