If a cell changes it will mark itself and its neighbours as dirty. During the render phase all dirty cells will have their vertices calculated and cached. If a cell is not dirty, the pre-calculated vertices are retrieved from cache. Then the sprite renderer is provided the sprite and the pre-calculated vertices to draw.\n\nThis prevents constant recalculation of vertices for the shroud in the render phase, requiring instead only dirty cells in the visible area. The update phase is reduced to a practical noop, instead incurring the cost only of changed cells each frame, rather than checking the visible area.\n\n---\n\nThis is a revival of #7095 with some updates. I initially thought @pchote's proof on concept would be the same for performance, and it was far less code so I thought it'd be a better choice.\n\nSadly it's not. You need to update the cell and its 8 neighbours. If you generate vertices right away you end up doing a substantial amount of work that can easily be avoided by delaying the work until you actually need to render the vertices.\n\nI tested this version, and saw total CPU time for rendering the shroud drop from 28% (told you it was expensive!) to 9% of all CPU time spent.\n\nIn theory, this means if you get a solid 50 fps, you could now be getting 60 fps instead!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7305/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7304","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7304/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7304/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7304/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7304","id":53928821,"number":7304,"title":"Make global chat the default mode in the ingame chat widget","user":{"login":"obrakmann","id":4331210,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4331210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann","html_url":"https://github.com/obrakmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2015-01-09T23:28:24Z","updated_at":"2015-01-10T09:17:36Z","closed_at":"2015-01-10T09:17:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/7304","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7304","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7304.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7304.patch"},"body":"Currently, the in-game chat widget starts off in team chat mode.

Additionally, HardwarePalette.ApplyModifiers sees a nice speedup as it has to transfer a much smaller amount of memory from the buffer to the texture.\n\nTo facilitate this change, the MaxPalettes constant is no longer publicly exposed.
