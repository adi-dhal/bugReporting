In CNC it is used as a repair bad for helis. I like this, but there are some issues.\n\n1) HPAD does not allow newly constructed helis spawn while another heli is on the pad repairing. I think they should be able to spawn. \n2) Helis on the repair pad do not go to the rally points when repair is complete. Instead they sit there. \n3) You cannot queue a heli to land for repairs while another one is on the pad. With FIX, you can have queues of units that wait until the previous unit leaves the pad before entering for repairs.
