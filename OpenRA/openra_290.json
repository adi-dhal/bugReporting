OpenRA work on OpenBSD? It builds fine, but fails to run (both release and git HEAD). \n\nHere is what I get on the latest release:\n\n```\nwilfred:OpenRA-release-20131223> mono OpenRA.Game.exe        \nPlatform is Linux\nUsing SDL 1.2 with OpenGL renderer\nDesktop resolution: 1366x768\nNo custom resolution provided, using desktop resolution\nUsing resolution: 1366x768\nRenderer initialization failed.

Something in SDL failed perhaps? No `graphics.log` was emitted...\n\nHere is what I get on git HEAD:\n\n```\nwilfred:OpenRA> mono OpenRA.Game.exe        \nPlatform is Linux\nUsing SDL 2 with OpenGL renderer\nRenderer initialization failed.

is:\n\n```\nvga1 at pci0 dev 2 function 0 \"Intel HD Graphics 4000\" rev 0x09\n```\n\nHere are my SDL, OpenAL and mono versions:\n\n```\nwilfred:~> pkg_info | grep -E 'mono-2|sdl|openal'

think #5120 showed a limitation of the current Normal damage model/Spread logic.\n\nFor a weapon like the Ion Cannon, you want maximum damage at the targeted cell, high damage at the 8 directly adjacent cells, maybe some very low damage at the outer border and then no damage at all about ~4 cells away from impact.\n\nWith DamageModel.Normal, that's currently next to impossible. Set a lower Spread value, and the area damage falls off too quickly, set it higher and the area that receives damage becomes rather large.\n\nWhat I'd propose is to add something like SpreadDamageFactor and MaxSpread settings to Warhead. SpreadDamageFactor would allow the modder to set a custom damage falloff multiplicator for every spread step (even allowing both decreasing and increasing damage), and MaxSpread would set an outer border at which damage is cut off completely regardless of the Spread value. This would give modders much more control over how exactly spread damage should behave, and would make fixing issues like #5120 much easier.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5436/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5435","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5435/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5435/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5435/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5435","id":34240024,"number":5435,"title":"Fixed RA camo pillbox desert art and aircraft selection boxes","user":{"login":"reaperrr","id":2857877,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2857877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperrr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-05-24T18:47:58Z","updated_at":"2014-07-05T12:26:35Z","closed_at":"2014-05-24T19:25:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/5435","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5435","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5435.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5435.patch"},"body":"Closes #4796 and #5208.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5435/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5434","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5434/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5434/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5434/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5434","id":34239883,"number":5434,"title":"Docking point of airfields etc. is not customizable","user":{"login":"reaperrr","id":2857877,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2857877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperrr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382407,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"02d7e1","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-05-24T18:38:35Z","updated_at":"2015-02-24T19:43:52Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Landing aircraft always land at CenterPosition.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue?

I click \"create game\", it will always say,\n\"Server: Psydev has joined the server\"\n\nbut it will very often NOT say:\n\"Server: Master server communication established\"\n\nI just noticed this behaviour within the last 2 weeks. So I will sit there and not realize that my game isn't being advertised. This happens maybe 25% of the time lately (typically only on the the first game creation, after starting the program).\n\nThe problem is solved when I cancel the game and create another one. But sometimes I sit there for a long time waiting for someone to join my game, without realizing that the game is not actually being advertised. It would be useful if OpenRA would produce some sort of warning message if it doesn't establish master server communication.\n\nSide note: one time I left this going for many hours, and then spontaneously it popped up with \"master server communication established\". I was surprised by this and it was the first time I noticed the bug, realizing that for all that time it didn't return that message. This is the only time this has happened. Normally I will leave it for hours and not notice, and the message will never come. It usually only comes within a couple seconds or not at all.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5420","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5420/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5420/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5420/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5420","id":34227172,"number":5420,"title":"New Maps","user":{"login":"NukemBro","id":1801219,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1801219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NukemBro","html_url":"https://github.com/NukemBro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NukemBro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NukemBro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NukemBro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NukemBro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NukemBro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NukemBro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NukemBro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NukemBro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NukemBro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2014-05-24T06:21:48Z","updated_at":"2014-07-02T16:00:38Z","closed_at":"2014-05-26T06:23:04Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/5420","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5420","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5420.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5420.patch"},"body":"-Added Updated/Balanced version of Doubles\n-Added \"Singles,\" 1v1 version of Doubles\n-Added \"Synergy,\" 3v3 Ground, Naval, and Air\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5419","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5419/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5419/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5419/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5419","id":34226856,"number":5419,"title":"Ingame news tweaks","user":{"login":"pchote","id":167819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/167819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote","html_url":"https://github.com/pchote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2014-05-24T06:11:06Z","updated_at":"2014-07-02T16:00:43Z","closed_at":"2014-05-24T08:19:20Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/5419","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5419","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5419.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5419.patch"},"body":"Improved layout and changes url to the (now deployed) http://open-ra.org/gamenews url.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5419/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4710","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"8C5D:572C:15E5035:2B7DA9E:59D6B68E","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=291>;
