http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=82&p=283580#283580\n\nAfter playing openRA on and off for a while, there is one thing I'd like to see changed more than anything else when playing multiplayer games: \n- Building structures next to your Ally can be done only with his/her Con.yard. \n\nTo be honest, I'm not too good with team-basewalking. When I face a front of buildings coming my way faster than my army can move on the ground, I usually raise my hands up in disbelief rather than calling up on my allies to help out build my opponents. \n\nThe fact is, too often new players are coming in only to be discouraged by established players who take control of the game with aggressive team-basewalking all over the map. New players remember the old Red Alert as a game of tanks, infantry,ships and aircrafts out on the battlefield, with a well established base supporting their army. When this nostalgic dream is countered by a rock solid wall of structures taking control of all resources on the map within 2 minutes, knocking on your front door in 4, they often leave never to return and we're left with a core of experienced players with a refined base stratergy that will shut out new players forever. \n\nIf building off ally construction yard was the default option it would change how we play the game significantly by forcing team players to support eachother with an army rather than with defensive structures. You could still basewalk by yourself and move your con.yard to establish a new base for your team. **Edit from Sleipnir's forum: I also think this would be a better solution than a con.yard distance-build-limit as proposed earlier by other players who wanted to try restrict basewalking: https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2156\n\nThe idea might go against the established players comfy levels but if you want the game to grow stronger beyond what we have today, then I feel this change HAS to be done. The gameplay will improve anyway.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2463","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2463/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2463/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2463/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2463","id":8080377,"number":2463,"title":"Feature request: Replay viewer needs a fog-of-war option!","user":{"login":"SoScared","id":2715583,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2715583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared","html_url":"https://github.com/SoScared","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoScared/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382407,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"02d7e1","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2012-11-03T15:51:32Z","updated_at":"2013-03-26T21:34:08Z","closed_at":"2013-03-26T21:34:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"crosspost: http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=82&t=16040\n\nI can watch replays for hours but when you watch a game with a lot of players it gets hard to keep track of everything.
