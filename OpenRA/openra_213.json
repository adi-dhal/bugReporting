Fixes #4798. Also see #6282.\n\nThis commit will change the following:\n1) Player's own countdown timers aren't shown in the text. This is redundant since it is already shown in the icons.\n2) Timers are divided into two groups: Allies and Enemies.\n3) Each group has a header which can be configured in ingame.yaml under SupportPowerTimer@SUPPORT_POWER_TIMER:.\n4) The old Order parameter in ingame.yaml is repurposed to configure which group will be shown on top. Default is EnemiesFirst, I thought enemy timers would be more important. Old Order parameter wasn't working for Ascending value.\n5) Player names are also shown in front of timer text. When the timer is zero, only the description text flashes white and not the player name.\n\nHere's what it looks like:\n![timer](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6599106/6831126/0582ab3c-d327-11e4-9999-5eaed3efd253.png)\n\nI tested this and seems to work.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7737/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7736","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7736/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7736/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7736/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7736","id":64296973,"number":7736,"title":"Fix a fatal error in allies05a","user":{"login":"abcdefg30","id":7704140,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7704140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30","html_url":"https://github.com/abcdefg30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":117740707,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Rebase%20me!","name":"PR: Rebase me!","color":"eb6420","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/12","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestone/12","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/12/labels","id":844833,"number":12,"title":"release-20150424","description":"","creator":{"login":"obrakmann","id":4331210,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4331210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann","html_url":"https://github.com/obrakmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":109,"state":"closed","created_at":"2014-10-29T09:04:03Z","updated_at":"2015-12-24T15:12:19Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2015-04-24T19:03:37Z"},"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-03-25T15:20:16Z","updated_at":"2015-03-26T21:53:34Z","closed_at":"2015-03-26T21:35:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/7736","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7736","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7736.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7736.patch"},"body":"Fixes the error described in #7735.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7735","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7735/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7735/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7735/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7735","id":64256306,"number":7735,"title":"(Fixed in playtest 2015-04-18) Allied 5a: Tanyas tale -

Instead, we now delay this extra rendering until the actor actually becomes invisible. This eliminates the wasted rendering to generate renderables that were never used.\n\nA great example is the RA shellmap, which previously spent 7.0% of the total CPU time generating these renderables just in case. Since the viewer can never see a frozen actor on the shellmap, this was all wasted. With this PR, it now spends 0% of its time doing this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7733","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7733/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7733/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7733/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7733","id":64061338,"number":7733,"title":"Disable
