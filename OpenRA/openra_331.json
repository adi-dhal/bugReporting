It either needs a longer time operation (and thus more damage to buildings and units). \n\nOther uses of the mad Tank: \n-- Destroy walls\n-- destroy ore (but not the ore mine)\n\n2) Not sure if this is a feature or bug: **My own units kept dying on my mines**. I played allies. I liked it, as it made mines a double edged sword. Just mentioning it here, in case it is a bug. #3513\n\n3) **The build radius is a excellent improvement**. It will make base walking much more cost intensive. \n\n4) **The change to give E3 a speed boost has greatly affected their use in a positive way** - finally one can use them next to E1s in offensive operations.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4209/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4208","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4208/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4208/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4208/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/4208","id":23557066,"number":4208,"title":"SpriteReader
