have been increasingly common over the last few releases.  We still don't know what triggers them, but we do know that restarting the server fixes them.\n\nClients can connect to the server and recieve the initial MOTD and map, but the ping then immediately switches to grey and players are kicked for \"connection problems\".\n\nWhen connecting to one of these servers I see the following traffic: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=jyWF8cAF\n\nThere are two things to notice here:\n1.  128 orphaned ClientPing entries in the `SyncInfo` order (only the last one, for my client id 496, is valid).\n2.  No `SyncClientPings` or `SyncLobbyClients` orders, which should have followed immediately after this if the server was working properly.\n\nI strongly suspect that this was introduced by #5115, but

without adjusting the kill/death count (engineer/spy behaviour).\n\nI think it would be useful to take this on to prep since it is part of the overall d2k balance, so I have limited this pr to only

I don't know how 'Earned/min' is calculated but I suspect it's done over a relatively long time-interval. If the economy of a player shifts somewhere past 10 minutes (often earlier), then for some reason it feels like the stat takes forever to catch up to reality, making comparisons of players' economy for this stat nonsensical in the late-game.\n\nThe 'Earned this minute' is accurate but it requires you to follow the numbers for a little while as it builds up and resets every minute. You don't want to wait for that. Perhaps if this instead showed 'Earned last minute' and only updated itself every minute then it would be something you would want to have a peak at from time to time.\n##

represents the first work towards refactoring to permit multiple resource queues. The first commit requires explicit specification of resource types on various traits which affected cash or resources previously, and the second commit lets a unit's value span across multiple resources.\n\nOne thing that's missing here is handling of text. Currently, for all text purposes, all resources are still just summed up and used.\n\nI'm also unsure of the map upgrades. In particular, I'm unsure how the oramaps are affected and whether the upgrade code works correctly. The upgrade code seemed to fail on upgrading `^Templates`, but worked fine on regular units. Any comments/feedback would be appreciated!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10075/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10074","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10074/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10074/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10074/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10074","id":118278030,"number":10074,"title":"Add SpiceSand to more terrain type definitions","user":{"login":"OmegaBolt","id":8225171,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8225171?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaBolt","html_url":"https://github.com/OmegaBolt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaBolt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaBolt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaBolt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaBolt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaBolt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaBolt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaBolt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaBolt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaBolt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":203838214,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20For%20stable","name":"PR: For stable","color":"733799","default":false},{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/16","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestone/16","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/16/labels","id":1214438,"number":16,"title":"release-20151224","description":"","creator":{"login":"reaperrr","id":2857877,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2857877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperrr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":235,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-07-18T22:57:47Z","updated_at":"2015-12-24T15:10:59Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2015-12-24T15:10:59Z"},"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-11-22T18:07:22Z","updated_at":"2015-11-22T20:55:27Z","closed_at":"2015-11-22T20:54:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/10074","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10074","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10074.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10074.patch"},"body":"Yep, there were some... basically needed to add the new terraintype to more places.

Then if you scout the area it shows the building but not the little marker. Well, say that player sells that building or some shit like that, then the GPS will just leave you seeing the building, however if it were the house marker, that would disappear.\n\nHow to put this?\n\nGPS will show changes for buildings you have not actually scouted yet. However buildings that you have scouted won't show changes.\nSo its kinda inconsistent if you see what I'm saying?\n\nPossible solution: Show house marker over known buildings.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10073/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10072","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10072/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10072/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10072/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10072","id":118276374,"number":10072,"title":"Monster tank madness polish","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2015-11-22T17:31:47Z","updated_at":"2015-12-25T20:39:16Z","closed_at":"2015-12-25T20:36:43Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/10072","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10072","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10072.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10072.patch"},"body":"Few bit of polish for this mission.\n1.
