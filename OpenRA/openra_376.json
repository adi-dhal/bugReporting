is hard to fix the dedicated server because it blocks {DEV_VERSION} by default with some obscure hard-coded conditionals. There are also other annoyances:\n- People can bomb in with their self-compiled {DEV_VERSION} if the server is not dedicated although we warn in the lobby about that.\n- People bomb into @ScottNZ and mine {DEV_VERSION} test-games with their stable releases and we have to explain or rudely kick them over and over again.\n\nThis addresses everything by introducing two new variables:\n1. Reject from connections different versions (also covers the case if people direct connect overriding the server browser GUI based check)\n2. Add a new Debug options so you can join every game with every version (if the server allows it, which he does not by default)\n\nStill warn about {DEV_VERSION} as we don't know which commit we are on.\n\nI also decided to ship the launch script from https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Dedicated because it has sane defaults. Everyone should use it. Plus I can then just type `./lauch-dedicated.sh` and `./launch-game.sh` when doing extensive
