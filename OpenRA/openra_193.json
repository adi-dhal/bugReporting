trying the (awesome!) Tiberian Sun mod and the whole screen is flickering (in self-compiled OpenRA on Linux). In TS mod the whole screen (or map, it's hard to tell) flickers when in the main game menu (with the map in the background) and in the game itself. It looks like the color of the whole screen is changing to black.\n\nI'm getting some flickering in RA mod too and even in the recent playtest. In the game, when I go to the menu (with Esc) unrevealed terrain appears for short periods of time. When I return to main menu I get the flickering again (black color appearing) but it seems that it is in longer period then in TS mod.\n\nNoting is happening when I play in windowed mode but in fullscreen and pseudo-fullscreen, screen flickers.\n\nI'm using Lubuntu 15.04 (Vivid Vervet) with LXDE desktop environment, Openbox windows-manager, LightDM display manager and the following configuration:\n\nGraphics card info (`lspci | grep -i graphics`):\n\n```\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 02)\n```\n\nCPU info (`cat /proc/cpuinfo | head -n 27`):\n\n```\nprocessor       : 0\nvendor_id       : GenuineIntel\ncpu family      : 6\nmodel           : 37\nmodel name      : Intel(R) Core(TM) i5 CPU       M 480  @ 2.67GHz\nstepping        : 5\nmicrocode       : 0x2\ncpu MHz         : 1599.000\ncache size      : 3072 KB\nphysical id     : 0\nsiblings        : 4\ncore id         : 0\ncpu cores       : 2\napicid          : 0\ninitial apicid  : 0\nfpu             : yes\nfpu_exception   : yes\ncpuid level     : 11\nwp              : yes\nflags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov pat pse36 clflush dts acpi mmx fxsr sse sse2 ss ht tm pbe syscall nx rdtscp lm constant_tsc arch_perfmon pebs bts rep_good nopl xtopology nonstop_tsc aperfmperf pni dtes64 monitor ds_cpl vmx est tm2 ssse3 cx16 xtpr pdcm pcid sse4_1 sse4_2 popcnt lahf_lm ida arat dtherm tpr_shadow vnmi flexpriority ept vpid\nbugs            :\nbogomips        : 5319.60\nclflush size    : 64\ncache_alignment : 64\naddress sizes   : 36 bits physical, 48 bits virtual\npower management:\n```\n\nOpenGL version (`glxinfo | grep \"OpenGL\"`):\n\n```\nOpenGL vendor string: Intel Open Source Technology Center\nOpenGL renderer string: Mesa DRI Intel(R) Ironlake Mobile \nOpenGL version string: 2.1 Mesa 10.5.2\nOpenGL shading language version string: 1.20\nOpenGL extensions:\nOpenGL ES profile version string: OpenGL ES 2.0 Mesa 10.5.2\nOpenGL ES profile shading language version string: OpenGL ES GLSL ES 1.0.16\nOpenGL ES profile extensions:\n```\n\nMono version (`mono --version`):\n\n```\nMono JIT compiler version 3.2.8 (Debian 3.2.8+dfsg-4ubuntu4)\nCopyright (C) 2002-2014 Novell, Inc, Xamarin Inc and Contributors. www.mono-project.com\n    TLS:           __thread\n    SIGSEGV:       altstack\n    Notifications: epoll\n    Architecture:  amd64\n    Disabled:      none\n    Misc:          softdebug \n    LLVM:          supported, not enabled.\n    GC:            sgen\n```\n\nI see that the Mono version is quite old (Feb 2014), so I have tried the new one:\n\n```\nMono JIT compiler version 4.0.1 (tarball Tue May 12 15:39:23 UTC 2015)\nCopyright (C) 2002-2014 Novell, Inc, Xamarin Inc and Contributors. www.mono-project.com\n    TLS:           __thread\n    SIGSEGV:       altstack\n    Notifications: epoll\n    Architecture:  amd64\n    Disabled:      none\n    Misc:          softdebug \n    LLVM:          supported, not enabled.\n    GC:            sgen\n```\n\nHowever, I get the same flickering in playtest. Now it is visible in the main menu right away without going to game first. I was not able to check bleed branch because with `make all` I get:\n\n```\nCSC fixheader.exe\nerror CS8001: Warning as Error: SDK path could not be resolved\nCompilation failed: 1 error(s), 0 warnings\nMakefile:257: recipe for target 'fixheader.exe' failed\nmake: *** [fixheader.exe] Error 1\n```\n\nThis happens after successful `make dependencies` preceded by `make clean` (and `git clean -f`). It might be caused by some mess in the system due to the packages from external sources but I don't know.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/19281252-whole-screen-flickers-especially-in-ts-mod?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8339","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8339/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8339/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8339/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8339","id":83222871,"number":8339,"title":"Step in the direction of RA2 paratroopers","user":{"login":"matija-hustic","id":5747153,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5747153?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic","html_url":"https://github.com/matija-hustic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija-hustic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":36,"created_at":"2015-05-31T23:30:33Z","updated_at":"2015-07-24T13:54:02Z","closed_at":"2015-07-14T20:29:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/8339","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8339","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8339.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8339.patch"},"body":"`Parachute` effect replaced by an in-world actor implementing the `Parachute` activity.
