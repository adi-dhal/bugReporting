Expected behaviour is to build more infantry, tanks, navy and stuff, but instead, AI decides to build more Ore Silos to store money. This gives no challenge to a human player and makes the gameplay very boring overall. The forementioned event happens especially when playing with low tech levels and in maps with lots of ore.\n\n2: AI should capture buildings\n\nDoes AI capture oil derricks? Or does it try to take enemy/your buildings? As far as I've seen, there is no such feature yet. Would be great improvement because it adds game dynamics and interaction between players.\n\n3: AI descriptions\n\nRed Alert AI descriptions are quite understandable. However, I have no idea about C&C TD AI behaviours. How does Watson, or Cabal act in the game field? How do they differ from each other? These unclear and mythic AI titles should be described clearly to a player to improve gaming experience to the end-user.\n\n4: Adjustable AI difficulty\n\nAs far as I can remember, there were such feature in the original Red Alert. AI difficulty should be adjustable so players could improve their gaming experience.

inspecting the map format, i noticed that the gems/ore values arent read correctly at all.\n\nProblems found:\n- OpenRA ignores the resource density value completely and uses its own algorithm to re-write those densities.\n- There is 3 usable levels of gems densities, but it seems to use only 2 of those levels in the game.\n\nIt would be good if we could add new option in the map.yaml such as \"FixedResources\" which means that it would actually read the resourcemap and use those densities defined in it.\n\nBut the problem is that there is no publicly released editors currently to actually write and read those values correctly. However, i am making an editor currently, and it would be very nice if we could edit resourcemaps more precisely. I can already save maps resources/tiles in my editor.\n\nThe current map editor that comes with OpenRA actually also adds incorrect values into the gems densities: 0-3 randomly, when it should be 0-2.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/4194427-fix-resourcemap-reading-and-rendering?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6395/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6394","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6394/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6394/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6394/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/6394","id":41772221,"number":6394,"title":"Refund information missing","user":{"login":"ImagoTrigger","id":3333956,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3333956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImagoTrigger","html_url":"https://github.com/ImagoTrigger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImagoTrigger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImagoTrigger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImagoTrigger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImagoTrigger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImagoTrigger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImagoTrigger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImagoTrigger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImagoTrigger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImagoTrigger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":117739713,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Changes%20requested","name":"PR: Changes requested","color":"e11d21","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2014-09-03T01:00:05Z","updated_at":"2015-03-07T14:06:59Z","closed_at":"2014-09-20T13:24:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/6394","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/6394","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/6394.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/6394.patch"},"body":"Closes #5563\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6393","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6393/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6393/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6393/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6393","id":41751845,"number":6393,"title":"MSBUILD does not support our current project setups.","user":{"login":"Unit158","id":706008,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/706008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158","html_url":"https://github.com/Unit158","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":10028244,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Packaging","name":"Packaging","color":"bfd4f2","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-09-02T20:36:55Z","updated_at":"2014-12-29T03:41:23Z","closed_at":"2014-12-29T03:41:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"```\nBuilding the projects in this solution one at a time.
