In Dune 2000 the thumper infantry which spawn a worm even makes it a weapon for multiplayer matches. It should behave like a moving anti-vehicle mine. In my early experiments it uses wormsigns to indicate it's position all the time. In the original it had moving sand tiles (maybe a palette rotation?) and only occasional wormsigns (there different ones which should occur randomly). It will also trigger the audio-notifier \"wormsigns\". AttackWander and TerrainSpeeds work fine for a worm that goes through the sand only.\n\nI already tried to use the existing weapons.\n- AttackLeap was too powerful as it instantly killed stuff occasionally without disappearing. Also the dog bark seemed hard-coded and you could not see the worm attacking.\n- (anti vehicle) mines make more sense. The explosion could be the worm mouth and when it ate a unit it should disappear (in the original it eats 3 units). However the units never triggered the explosions. Might be incompatible to the combination of movement.\n\n<bountysource-plugin>\n\n---\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Place a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/98205-sandworm-that-eats-whole-units?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2245/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2244","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2244/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2244/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2244/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/2244","id":5223900,"number":2244,"title":"small Dune 2000 update","user":{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2012-06-22T21:07:53Z","updated_at":"2014-07-02T16:51:28Z","closed_at":"2012-06-24T21:44:31Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/2244","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/2244","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/2244.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/2244.patch"},"body":"This adds a harmless sandworm, an ugly harvester unload animation and otherwise mostly notifications that I made race specific because Dune 2000 has 3 different announcer voices.
