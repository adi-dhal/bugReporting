the original games, I believe units could fire over barbed wire and sandbags, but that it would block the paths of light vehicles and infantry.\n\nIn oRA, these seem to block projectiles too, making them more like cheap weak walls. I think it would be  more interesting to allow units to shoot through them but still block the paths of light vehicles and infantry.\n\nThat is unless it is actually a ray-caster issue that these units can't fire over them?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9320/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4840","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"8314:572D:13F45DB:3075575:59D6B49D","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=161>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=405>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=159>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"70e0a7fa8965910263ce20408903db58\"","status":"200 OK"}}
