would be really useful to have a \"distribute units across area\" command.\n\nI imagine it working much like the mine layer in that a rectangular area can be chosen. This would be a one-off thing, though, unlike the mine layer, and any selected units move to points spread out across the selected area. It'd be great for sending rocket troops to defend an ore field from helicopters, for example, rather than having to move them out one at a time or repeatedly hit X until they're sufficiently far apart. It'd also be useful for telling a bunch of artillery to arrange themselves into a line (a 1-by-X rectangle), spacing themselves out defensively.\n\nA basic implementation would choose tiles in the area at random for each selected unit; a better one would choose randomly out of only viable tiles (no water for ground units, for example); better again would look at the space selected and the number of units and distribute them evenly. Better still, the target points would be assigned in some sane way, for example making the expected transit times for each unit as even as possible.\n\nThinking about it even more, the abilities of the selected units could be examined and target destinations chosen to distribute _those_. For example, strong vs air, strong vs armour and strong vs infantry units distributed somewhat evenly. Of course, that could be done fairly easily by the user in a multi step process too, by selecting all rocket soldiers at once and distributing them, then doing the same for riflemen and so on.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/1434766-distribute-units-in-area?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4812","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4812/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4812/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4812/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/4812","id":28940698,"number":4812,"title":"Renamed Flak Truck to Mobile Flak","user":{"login":"cjshmyr","id":566742,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/566742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr","html_url":"https://github.com/cjshmyr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-03-07T06:20:47Z","updated_at":"2014-07-02T16:12:00Z","closed_at":"2014-03-07T16:06:01Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/4812","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/4812","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/4812.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/4812.patch"},"body":"Needed to remake this PR.\n\nRenamed Flak Truck to Mobile Flak, also updated the unit to use a new icon provided by @KatzSmile, located here: http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=83&p=286374#286374.

Originally there was no music, but then i downloaded the disc iso for GDI and went back, the mod extracted the music just fine. Then I decided to try and add the extra unused songs available from C&C v1.06c by adding the scores mix file directly (a suggestion on the forums of cncc-comm when i was looking for the music) and it worked, but got rid of all the original music! I decided I'd rather have the first set, so i deleted the scores.mix file and opened it again, but now all the music is gone except the menu music and mission complete music. I tried extracting from the cd again, but there's an error every time. Even tried extracting from the Nod iso, same problem. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, same thing.

But this is not always helpful. Often times players have very similar colors, the same color may be chosen by players on different teams and it is hard to distinguish which timer belongs to which player. Instead of colors, player names should be used to show countdown timers. Timers for allies could be shown in green and those for enemies in red. Or player colors and names both could be shown. Also I don't know if this is already done but timers for allies and enemies should be grouped so for example those for allies are on top and the ones for enemies below them...\n\nOf course multiple players may also have the same name but this is less of an issue and it also encourages players to change the default name \"Newbie\" to something else.\n\n<bountysource-plugin>\n\n---\n\nWant to back
