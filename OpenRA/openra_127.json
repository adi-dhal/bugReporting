Only when new terrain is revealed and their path seems to be blocked the path finding kicks in (a new path is calculated to 'get around the obstacle'. \n\nIn short: Path finding assumes shrouded areas are always passable.\n\nIn openRA i noticed my units already took the best path possible, even though they had never seen the terrain. This kind of makes the path finding very smart, but I also consider this a bit of cheating. \n\nRevealing shroud would really have an extra effect if you take the shrouded data into consideration when calculating the best path to reach a destination.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/29483308-pathfinding-disregards-shroud?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10339","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10339/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10339/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10339/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10339","id":124349736,"number":10339,"title":"Crash when trying save a map in the editor after manually editing the map.yaml","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382357,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Crash","name":"Crash","color":"e10c02","default":false},{"id":21746870,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Map%20Editor","name":"Map Editor","color":"eeeeee","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-12-30T13:46:18Z","updated_at":"2015-12-31T12:33:49Z","closed_at":"2015-12-31T12:33:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"On bleed\n\nI am trying to reduce the size of some maps due to the boundaries being in weird places.

are two main changes in this PR:\n- A new trait, `FrozenUnderFogUpdatedByGps`, replaces `GpsRemoveFrozenActor`. It supports removing frozen actors that are sold or die but also now supports refreshing the frozen actor when ownership changes. This brings it in line with the GPS dot which changes colour as required.\n- Remove the `IRemoveFrozenActor` interface. This caused `FrozenActorLayer.Tick` to be quite slow. The new trait only needs to run when the GPS state changes, rather than every tick. This is faster.\n\nI would test the following:\n- When a GPS is launched, that frozen actors are updated as follows:\n  - A frozen actor for a sold building is removed.\n  - A frozen actor for a destroyed building is removed.\n  - A frozen actor for a building that was captured is updated with new colours.\n- With an active GPS, check that frozen actors are updated live for the above three scenarios.\n\n---\n\nOn the RA shellmap, reduces CPU time spent in `FrozenActorLayer.Tick` from 1.39% to 0.83%.\n\nSuggested changelog: GPS updates frozen actors that change owner\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10324/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10323","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10323/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10323/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10323/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10323","id":124226675,"number":10323,"title":"Ensure some structs implement IEquatable<T>.","user":{"login":"RoosterDragon","id":3399086,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3399086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon","html_url":"https://github.com/RoosterDragon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-12-29T15:32:56Z","updated_at":"2015-12-30T19:19:04Z","closed_at":"2015-12-30T08:28:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/10323","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10323","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10323.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10323.patch"},"body":"I have moved around some of the code to make it consistent with existing overrides in other vectors such as `CPos`, `WVec`, etc.\n\nImplementating `IEquatable<T>` is important for structs as this is used as the default equality comparer (when available) for inbuilt collections that need a definition of equality (like `Dictionary`).
