I can understand the Mobile Gap Generator (MGG) having obvious disadvantages compared to the Gap Generator (GG) structure in order to give the latter appeal, the penalties the MGG is slapped with are excessive, especially since it ties up vehicle production for 36 seconds! The premium you pay for mobility and a lack of power consumption is as follows:\n- Vastly increased fragility: 200 HP vs 1000 HP\n- 50% greater build cost: $1500 vs $1000\n- 50% longer build time: 36 vs 24 seconds.\n- 33% smaller shroud (4 vs 6).\n\nObviously this is way too onerous.\n\nSuggestions for improving MGGs so they're worth using:\n- Fold the Mobile Radar Jammer (MRJ) capabilities into the MGG. MRJs seem way too niche and redundant to begin with anyways, and this just makes narrative sense as Gap tech disrupts radar/GPS capabilities.\n- Reduce the cost of the GG to $800 and the MGG to $1200. Why on earth is the GG priced so much higher than the Turret and AA gun? Why would you ever pay $1500 for an MGG when that nets you a Medium Tank + Light Tank or Ranger or Artillery and then some?\n- Reduce the build time of both the GG and the MGG to ~18 seconds; I'm not sure why the build time was so long for either to begin with, but in the case of the MGG it is ridiculously excessive; tying up vehicle production for 36 seconds to build this thing is just crazy. Decreasing MGG's build time to 24 seconds should be done at a bare minimum.\n- Increase sight range to 10. This helps it act in the capacity of a support vehicle, and it's not as big an advantage as it otherwise would be in light of the GPS Satellite.\n\n<bountysource-plugin>\n\n---\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Place a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/136841-improve-mobile-gap-generators?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4628","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"9DD9:572C:1600615:2BB4235:59D6BA10","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=373>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=405>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=371>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"ee11297b87c973e93136a2c421855c79\"","status":"200 OK"}}
