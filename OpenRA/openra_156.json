for TD missions the player is either referenced as \"GDI/Nod\" or \"player\"\n- `player = Player.GetPlayer(\"GDI\")` (gdi01)\n- `gdi = Player.GetPlayer(\"GDI\")` (gdi04a)\n\nshould this be made consistent throughout all TD missions?\n\nI'd prefer to always use \"player/enemy\" for factions for two reasons:\n- makes code more readable\n- makes code more reusable (copy&paste a function from a gdi to a nod mission without having to deal with gdi/nod mixups; also half the missions capitalize the player as \"Nod\", the other half as \"nod\")\n\nthis should reduces the chance for bugs

and https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9029 are good ideas, but they have bad discover-ability by the players. They need to already know that thirdparty mods exist, where to find them and that you can install those just like browser addons. This proposal may however not exclude the previous ideas of \"manual\" installations from URLs and in-game updating, but rather complete it.\n\nOther Open Source game engine projects already solved this:\n\nInspiration:\n- https://bananas.openttd.org\n- https://springrts.com/wiki/Games\n\nAn in-game browser lists assets and mods available for download via the repository. That way you can discover a whole palette of mods you didn't know about. Downside is that this relies on a (yet non-existing) web-service. It may be in the scope of http://resource.openra.net though. Might also be the best way to ship mini mods (\"mutators\") https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9422.\n\nWith the rejection of https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9396 I thought this further. If separating mods and engine completely is the preferred way, we probably need this badly so people don't first start the game and see \"Choose your battlefield: no mods installed\" and quit, uninstall, comment \"doesn't work\", because they forgot to click on an `openra-mod://mods.openra.net/ra-release-2042-10-23.zip` URL somewhere hidden in the news post.\n\nWe probably have to ship a blank engine with just a `modbrowser` mod. A benefit of not including any non-free content and downloading everything on first game start may be that this open the doors for inclusion in official Linux repositories if we ever want this especially in ones with long release cycles.\n\nSynchronizing the releases of all currently supported mods together with the engine isn't a trivial matter though and probably will lead to some player base fragmentation. On the other hand, very actively developed mods don't have to wait for another release cycle to do balancing adjustments etc.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on

think the server browser (and to some extent the lobby) are in need of an overhaul. Here's a mockup I created fairly quickly with a few concepts highlighted. I'm not a self proclaimed design expert at all :), please chime in!\n\nServer\n- Show up to 10 servers at a time now with a flatter lobby list. Currently with the chat we only see 3!\n- Show a panel on the right for more detailed information, we don't really care about some of this stuff for every single server (minimap preview, ip, version, and potentially players)\n- Potentially allow players to sort by clicking on the server list columns\n- Move the server filter into its own popup panel, which would show over the server list\n- Change the chat to be tabbed - this means once you join a server, you can alternate between global and lobby chat\n\nLobby\n- Added a Music button and moved the Change Map button. The Music panel would cover the player bin when opened.\n- Changed the chat to be tabbed - let you switch between lobby and global chat.\n\nMockups (the OpenRA window is 1280x1024)\n- It was suggested we keep the geometry of the server browser and game lobby the same size\n- This has to fit the user interface's design limitation of 1024x768 size

render every effect in the world, including those that are outside the screen bounds.  Adding a new `SpatiallyPartitioned<IEffect> partitionedEffects` to ScreenMap for use by the WorldRenderer should give us a reasonable rendering performance win.  As an added bonus this should cut the rendering workload to the point where it is feasible to interleave actor and effect renderables, which fixes a big chunk of polish issues.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9443/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9442","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9442/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9442/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9442/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9442","id":108457584,"number":9442,"title":"Fixed AI bots trying to assign orders to units not in the world","user":{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/16","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestone/16","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/16/labels","id":1214438,"number":16,"title":"release-20151224","description":"","creator":{"login":"reaperrr","id":2857877,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2857877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperrr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":235,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-07-18T22:57:47Z","updated_at":"2015-12-24T15:10:59Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2015-12-24T15:10:59Z"},"comments":7,"created_at":"2015-09-26T11:31:17Z","updated_at":"2015-10-10T19:53:09Z","closed_at":"2015-10-10T19:21:10Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/9442","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9442","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9442.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9442.patch"},"body":"The AI was ordering units around which are not in the world.
