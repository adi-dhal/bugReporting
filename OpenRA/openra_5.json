actors how to properly behave when ordered to interact with frozen actors is a prerequisite for TS (#11265 is a major issue for cloak generators), and something we'd like to fix in general for the next release.  This is tricky right now because the Order class was never taught about Target, and frozen actor targeting is a bolted on kludge.\r\n\r\nThis PR starts the fixing this by introducing a new `Order` constructor that accepts a `Target`, and migrating all order issuing to use it.  Future PRs will push this through serialization/deserialization and then order resolving.\r\n\r\nOnce this is complete we will be able to implement the changes from #13363 across several smaller (and more reviewable) PRs by porting traits/activities from `ResolveFrozenActorOrder` to the native `Order.Target` on an activity-by-activity basis.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13995/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13994","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13994/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13994/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13994/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13994","id":255859670,"number":13994,"title":"teleport 13 tank in one chrono action","user":{"login":"AliT1993","id":30548034,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/30548034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliT1993","html_url":"https://github.com/AliT1993","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliT1993/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliT1993/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliT1993/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliT1993/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliT1993/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliT1993/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliT1993/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliT1993/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliT1993/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-09-07T08:42:33Z","updated_at":"2017-09-07T13:14:15Z","closed_at":"2017-09-07T13:14:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"hi\r\nin multiplayer game i saw this action more than one time and i attach last replay in this issue\r\ni know this is a bug but how can do it ? when somebody do it against me its not be a fareplay !!!\r\nand somtimes teleported tanks don't returned to beginig place and stay on other side!\r\nyou can see this in attached replay file more than one time and first one ocured in 17:12\r\n\r\n[OpenRA-2017-09-06T155120Z.orarep.zip](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/files/1283990/OpenRA-2017-09-06T155120Z.orarep.zip)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13994/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13993","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13993/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13993/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13993/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13993","id":255820378,"number":13993,"title":"Remove dead WSB from Refinery trait","user":{"login":"forcecore","id":632278,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/632278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/forcecore","html_url":"https://github.com/forcecore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forcecore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forcecore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forcecore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forcecore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forcecore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forcecore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forcecore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forcecore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forcecore/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-09-07T05:35:03Z","updated_at":"2017-09-09T10:15:33Z","closed_at":"2017-09-09T10:15:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/13993","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13993","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13993.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13993.patch"},"body":"WithSpriteBody code in Refinery trait seems to be dead.

adds the `ScreenMap` plumbing for sprite `IEffect`s (which can later be used for other `IEffect`s as well) and adapts all the easy sprite effects.\r\n\r\nThe only one of real importance here will be `SpriteEffect`, as it's used in `LeavesTrails`, projectile sprite trails and explosions, as well as a few other places.\r\n\r\nThe other migrated effects will likely give no noticable performance gains, but I migrated them as well since they were similarly easy to adapt and just might save a tiny additional bit of render time here and there.\r\n\r\nNote about effects not touched by this PR:\r\n- Support for `IEffectAboveShroud` effects would seemingly require some more changes to `WorldRenderer` (if at all possible) for presumably low gains (compared to `SpriteEffect`), so a decision and possible implementation is deferred to the future.\r\n- System-drawn effects like contrails and beams, as well as special cases like TeslaZaps, and therefore most projectiles will possibly require some more low-level preparations and for that reason are left to a later follow-up, although they are definitely desired due to expected gains comparable to (or larger than) `SpriteEffect` in mods with considerable use of these.\r\n\r\nSupersedes #11676.\r\nPartially adresses

global hotkeys in the static order handling plumbing is fundamentally incompatible with the future mod-defined hotkey system: it is too low level to be exposed to mod code or to the linter.  Fortunately we already have a pattern for mod-defined global hotkeys, as used by the music player.\r\n\r\nThis PR migrates the screenshot and mute (which previously only worked ingame) hotkeys to this new system, and removes the `DevReloadChrome` and `HideUserInterface` hotkeys.  These latter two are hacks that don't (and shouldn't!) work from mod code, so they can't easily be made to work with the new system.  Since they are both niche features that don't have (in my opinion) compelling use cases I felt that it was better to remove them than to let them stop progress towards the hotkey improvements.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13974/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13973","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13973/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13973/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13973/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13973","id":254861700,"number":13973,"title":"Merge
