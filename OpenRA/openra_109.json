on UI and future development**\n\nAfter more than year of playing OpenRA I found it more than sufficient in terms of in-game feature development, but somehow disappointing in terms of UI enhancements. This could lead to turning away from the game from the start for people who aren't familiar with C&C but tried to play OpenRA. I'm basing on personal experience and experience of friends and familiar designers. Current UI is straightforward, but not intuitive and bulky. Now you can expect to see things not fitting for place, like \"Music\" section in \"Skirmish\".\n\nI and many other devs see OpenRA as base platform for development. That's where we need to start.\n\n**1. Mods Section**\nOpenRA is a platform that gathered old C&C games around it. And we remember that there are a lot of mods that base on main games. So we should take original main games as _\"MASTER MODS\"_ and name every mod that bases on them as _\"BRANCH MODS\"_. People still can create their own Master Mods that heavily modify engine and serve as independent game. People who add couple of new tanks to opposite sides and bunch of missions usually heavily rely on Master Mods, so they only need a link to Master Mod.\n\n![oramods](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17611709/13489867/6cd9ed1e-e13a-11e5-932f-a2e3b54a2778.jpg)\n\nOne problem still exists up to this day - when you select \"Mods\" section you don't have option to go back to menu - it uses first time starting screen as default confingurator. Either load mod (which takes some time) or quit from game - no turning back. This is what should be fixed first.\n\n**2. Single Player**\nWhile single player missions is under construction development of this section UI can be put on hold. But basic point on Single Player structure should be noted:\n\nSingle Player:\n**+-** Campaigns (Main and Branch squential mission packs)\n**+-** Missions (Main and Branch separate missions maps, challenges and non-sequential mission packs)\n**+-** Skirmish\n\n**3. Multiplayer, Coop and Skirmish**\nThis is the main reason for writing this. Problems I see:\n- Chat section takes much space, but is necessary so it needs a \"Hide\" button (especially for Skirmish, where you don't write to anyone)\n- Chat typing section is small in comparison to chat log. Typing long sentences is incovenient.\n- \"Start Game\" and \"Back\" buttons are so close and misclicking is probable.\n- \"Music\" section in multiplayer game options??? I doubt the usefulness in this.\n- Whole UI needs some kind of folder bookmark style to intuitively navigate though options. Sections and buttons are scattered on the screen right now.\n- You can't get whole summary on used options fast.\n\nSo I suggest new multiplayer (coop and skirmish too) UI system:\n![oramulti](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17611709/13491666/bcfb945a-e144-11e5-8636-a5831e0d8941.jpg)\n\n_Sections:_\nPlayers - self-explanatory.\nOptions - this is where admon decides what type of game it will be (standart battle, infantry war, naval war, e.g.) and all types options in list that support that kind of game type (you don't need \"Ally Con. Yards\" or \"Starting Cash\" in mode without bases, for example). That will determine what maps can be used. This will require to mark maps with labels (what game types that map will support).\nMutators - this is where you can add and delete your micro-mods. Much like Unreal Tournament 2004. \"Double range of the artillery\" or \"No aircraft\", for example. Could be useful for quick balance changes and checks too. Fun intended too. Mutators must have labels as well - which game type they will support.\nSummary - quick glance on all options: selected map, players, game type, options, mutators and mutator options.\n\nMap section now will have technical data instead of creator name. Map selector don't need map type selector anymore in new UI.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10868/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10867","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10867/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10867/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10867/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10867","id":138127742,"number":10867,"title":"[Resource

I should have been chased and lynched for that.\n\nTo keep it short, I'm arguing for a slight nerf on the Demo Truck's blast damage against air units. Currently it's a kill guarantee within about 10 cells' radius for the YAK/Hind and 8 cells for the MiG/Longbow. For comparison, here's the kill guarantee for the blast radius versus artillery and infantry:\n![air inf](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2715583/13485492/aa91f764-e108-11e5-8f11-1b2c80daa96d.png)\n\nAbout 10 cells as well.\n\nMy comment from the previous issue:\n\nLogically air units are more resilient against nuke blasts than ground targets.\n\nBalance wise I think it's a good idea to not allow the nuke truck to completely wipe out a nearby (very expensive) air fleet 7-10 cells away. Scouting for nuke trucks should be rewarded. Sniping nuke trucks with lower tier air units already cost the attacker a loss ($1350 Hind/YAK).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10865/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10864","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10864/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10864/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10864/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10864","id":138000261,"number":10864,"title":"Property
