commit adds the `HealthPercentage` property to the `Explodes` class. This allows actors to be killed once they fall below a certain percentage of their health.\n\nThe second commit applies this functionality to RA fake structures. Most fakes now explode at 10% of their real counterparts max health.\n\nBefore\n![norm_fake](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3636652/10699673/7c529170-79b0-11e5-9f74-26eff3558def.gif)\n\nAfter\n![new_fake](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3636652/10699671/7b5d825c-79b0-11e5-97c5-53b506cf65e5.gif)\n\nPreviously a single rifle or flak burst would show a large chunk out of the visual health bar. Now fakes take damage at the same rate as their real counterparts. In the gifs above, both structures are destroyed after 100hp has been dealt (two grenades in this case). The gifs show the damage done from a single grenade.\n\nWF 100hp -> 150hp\nCY 100hp ->150hp\nSPEN 100hp -\nNY 100hp -\nDOME 100hp -\nATEK 100hp -> 40hp (perhaps this could do with a buff?)\n\nI have however buffed the fake msilo and fake pdox to explode at 50% since only 1 of each can be built, and it is pretty easy to get a couple rockets off from a paradrop now that you can select them in the air.\n\nPDOX 100hp -> 500hp\nMSILO 100hp -> 500hp\n\nThe one issue I have noticed that I discussed briefly on IRC, is that when a players fake structure is destroyed by an opponent, that player gains both a kill and a loss while the opponent who killed the actor gains nothing.\n\nIf anyone has ideas on how to solve this, please detail.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9729","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9729/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9729/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9729/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9729","id":113023577,"number":9729,"title":"Demo
