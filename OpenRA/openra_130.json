mentioned in #10235, it would be better to get this out of the way first before we remove `INotifyBuildComplete`.\n\nSince the number of places that check `self.IsDisabled()` is rather large and some related traits are not upgradable yet, I think the roadmap should look like this (exact order or number of steps might change):\n## 1.\n- [ ] Make all traits that need to be disabled under certain circumstances upgradable, if they aren't yet (an exception is `DisabledOverlay`, as we already have a replacement in `UpgradeOverlay`)\n- [ ] Check for `IsTraitDisabled` (in addition to `self.IsDisabled()`)\n## 2.\n- [ ] Remove `IDisable` from traits that implement it\n- [ ] Replace it on yaml level for `Husk` (as far as I can tell, apart from the overlay there currently isn't anything that requires husks being disabled anyway)\n- [ ] Replace it by granting upgrades on `Power`-related traits\n- [ ] Completely remove traits that become redundant (`DisabledOverlay` and `DisableOnUpgrade`)\n## 3.\n- [ ] Remove any remaining `self.IsDisabled()` checks from code\n- [ ] Remove `Actor.IsDisabled` and the `IDisable` interface\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this

`WithSiloAnimation` from `INotifyBuildComplete` to upgrades, and makes the `DisabledOverlay` trait upgradable itself, because we don't want it to be enabled while the make animation runs.\n\nI

I believe the bug happens because the game allows spawn A to be selected when slot 1 is unoccupied. When a player enters slot 1 and spawn A is already occupied, the game crashes.\n\nI fixed the issue for now by hardcoding spawns so it doesn't keep crashing but should someone investigate this issue they can use this version of the map: http://resource.openra.net/maps/6611\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on

am using playtest 20151213\nWhen playing the RA single player mission \"Tanya's Tale\", the spy gets detected by the soldiers and the flame turrets.\nThis makes completing the mission very hard, if not impossible.\n\nI believe in the original game, the soldiers did not detect a spy. I am unsure about the flame towers, though.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10226/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10225","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10225/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10225/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10225/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10225","id":122062556,"number":10225,"title":"Disable WithSpriteTurret until build/transform complete","user":{"login":"reaperrr","id":2857877,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2857877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperrr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2015-12-14T15:15:13Z","updated_at":"2015-12-29T15:29:26Z","closed_at":"2015-12-29T15:27:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/10225","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10225","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10225.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10225.patch"},"body":"Copying the approach of #10222.\n\nUnfortunately not enough to enable make animation on D2k turrets, seems `WithMakeAnimation`/ `INotifyBuildComplete` somehow conflict with `WithWallSpriteBody`, enabling `WithMakeAnimation` on D2k turrets still breaks them when built.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10225/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10224","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10224/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10224/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10224/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10224","id":122044350,"number":10224,"title":"Unit jumps a few pixels (when target is lost)","user":{"login":"pi99y","id":10639257,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10639257?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pi99y","html_url":"https://github.com/pi99y","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pi99y/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pi99y/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pi99y/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pi99y/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pi99y/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pi99y/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pi99y/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pi99y/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pi99y/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382400,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"d7e102","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-12-14T13:37:37Z","updated_at":"2015-12-14T14:51:30Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Tested on current bleed (2015/12/14) but also present in release-20150919, skirmish mode\n\nYou can see the V2 jump a few pixels to the left before moving away.
