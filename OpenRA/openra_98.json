#11184.\n\nOriginally, this was comparing distance beween `pos` and `unit.CenterPosition` with `HitShape`'s `OuterRadius`. However, the `OuterRadius` can exceed the shape for `Capsule` and `Rectangular` shapes, so I tried to adress that a few months ago by using the `DistanceFromEdge` check instead. The approach was bogus, though. `DistanceFromEdge` just calculates the distance of a position to the edge, so by comparing it with the distance between `pos` and `victim.CenterPosition` in combination with using `LengthSquared`, it was entirely possible the explosion would be within the `HitShape`, but closer to the edge than the `victim.CenterPosition` and the check would return `false`, despite the explosion happening inside the shape.\n\nNow we simply check if `DistanceFromEdge` is `0` or negative.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11192/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11191","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11191/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11191/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11191/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11191","id":151045329,"number":11191,"title":"[Idea]

it sometimes doesn't consider impacts within a `HitShape` as direct hits (particularly in TS).\n\nOne problem might be that `GetDirectHit` only checks for actors on the impact cell, but the target's `HitShape` might very well have been touched on a cell adjacent to the cell housing the actor's `CenterPosition`, so we should extend this to a search radius similar to what `SpreadDamageWarhead` has.\n\nAdditionally,\nhttps://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/bleed/OpenRA.Mods.Common/Warheads/CreateEffectWarhead.cs#L85\nlooks bogus to me. If I read that line correctly, when `DistanceFromEdge` is 0 (= inside `HitShape`), impact distance to target `CenterPosition` must be 0 as well to return `true`. But unless the projectile hits the target smack in the center, the target's `CenterPosition` will obviously be at least a bit further away than the `HitShape`, so this will almost never be true for slightly inaccurate weapons like missiles.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11183","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11183/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11183/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11183/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11183","id":150690179,"number":11183,"title":"Fixed
