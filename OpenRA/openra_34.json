having a problem with this trait, it seems to drop all attacks if it encounters a weapon that can't attack the target despite others being capable.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce this issue:\r\nusing the RA mod set the yaml PBOX cargo size & weight to 5.\r\nset the initial unit from e1 to e3.\r\nset the AttackGarrisoned, Armaments: to \"primary,secondary\".\r\n\r\nnow in game place a pill box and build a land unit and air unit, notice how you can force fire on the air unit and it works fine, but it will not attack the land unit at all. if you add other units inside they will also not attack unless they can hit the aircraft, also works in reverse with the rocket soldier going in last being unable to attack aircraft.\r\n\r\nThis issue stops garrisons from having more than a single weapon and having single unit cargo. I'm not sure if it was set up in RA to get around this bug, but I think it will be a good idea to fix for other mods.\r\n\r\nhaving downloading the source and messing around with AttackGarrisoned.cs I noticed that commenting out line 159 and 160\r\n158\t\t\t\tvar barrel = a.CheckFire(a.Actor, facing.Value, target);\r\n159\t\t\t\t//if (barrel == null)\r\n160\t\t\t\t//\treturn;\r\nthis makes it work as intended and without error so hopefully someone can work out why the return cancels the other armaments as I need this for a mod, thank you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13106","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13106/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13106/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13106/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13106","id":221003302,"number":13106,"title":"Add
