allows maps that are selectable in the lobby to assign unselectable factions to players without crashing.\n\nThere are two issues with this:\n1. The race needs to be locked, otherwise it gets ignored, and the default \"Any\" is used.\n2. When the map is changed, the slot keeps its previous (unselectable) race. A player may start a game with that configuration, but `Player::ChooseCountry` prevents that from actually working. The player will get a random faction instead. A similar thing happens with lobby options that get set by maps, they won't get unset either. There's a ticket for that somewhere.\n\nThis fixes #7927 and unbreaks our minigames.\n\nIf this fix is deemed to ugly, I propose to just make the allies and soviet factions selectable again.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7965","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7965/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7965/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7965/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7965","id":69042435,"number":7965,"title":"Playtest Debian Crash ","user":{"login":"barrettTom","id":5176580,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5176580?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/barrettTom","html_url":"https://github.com/barrettTom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barrettTom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barrettTom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barrettTom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barrettTom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barrettTom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barrettTom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barrettTom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barrettTom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barrettTom/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-04-17T01:26:57Z","updated_at":"2015-04-17T01:52:25Z","closed_at":"2015-04-17T01:37:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Very strange bug I have, when playing the first skirmish after installing game works wonderfully, but after playing and launching a second one it crashes.

#7945.\nI'm going to explain the problem very simple to facilitate reviewing:\nWe have CarryallA, CarryallB, CarryallC and Harvester. (**CarryallA should be the one delivering a new harvester to the refinery to reproduce easily; timing is very important**)\n- CarryallA dropps off Harvester, and Harvester immediately requests transport to somewhere else.\n- CarryallB is called in and reserves Harvester, so another carryall won't bother with it.\n- CarryallA has ticked his `Wait(10)` (removed in the diff below) and unreserves Harvester.\n- CarryallC, just becoming Idle (what luck, eh?), sees that Harvester wants transport but is not reserved and comes to the rescue to pick him up.\n\nFix is to unreserve the carryable immediatelly after dropping it off and not waiting for 10 ticks before doing it. This makes `State.Done` unneeded.\n\n`IsBusy = false;` is added because with the current set of changes, the carryall does not ascend to CruiseAltitude otherwise, because of [this check](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/10ff0be4671140945d461c4da96e3ab8612cf0cc/OpenRA.Mods.D2k/Traits/Carryall.cs#L60).\n\nThis will hopefully bring us (somewhat) back on track with the release.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7948/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7947","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7947/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7947/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7947/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7947","id":68190432,"number":7947,"title":"Fix flag-related crash for scripted \"players\"","user":{"login":"penev92","id":7137365,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7137365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92","html_url":"https://github.com/penev92","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/12","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestone/12","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/12/labels","id":844833,"number":12,"title":"release-20150424","description":"","creator":{"login":"obrakmann","id":4331210,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4331210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann","html_url":"https://github.com/obrakmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":109,"state":"closed","created_at":"2014-10-29T09:04:03Z","updated_at":"2015-12-24T15:12:19Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2015-04-24T19:03:37Z"},"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-04-13T20:45:19Z","updated_at":"2015-04-14T13:20:39Z","closed_at":"2015-04-14T13:20:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/7947","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7947","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7947.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7947.patch"},"body":"Fixes #7929, which is caused by flags not being set for scripted \"players\" like the Fort Lonestar soviet attackers and the scripted attackers on @Unit158's WIP map.\n\nFirst line fixes the crash by setting the flag name.\nSecond line fixes the scripted \"player\"'s faction being shows as \"soviet\" instead of \"Soviet\", which is a regression from #7722, I believe.
