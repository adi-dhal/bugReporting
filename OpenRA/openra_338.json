would be really interesting for some players to be able to modify contrast, brightness and hue.\n\nSome players may have bad (old) monitors and the only way to have a beautiful correct image would be to tweak these settings.\n\nAlso, some of the Red Alert and Tiberian Dawn ground tilesets sometimes look a bit dull. Being able to modify the  contrast, brightness or hue could improve their visual quality a lot.\n\nAnd it would awesome if it would be possible to apply these settings differently for two areas of the game:\n- tilesets \n- all the rest (units, buildings, trees...)\n\nI don't know if it's possible but with this option, the player could increase the color of the tileset without affecting the units..
