takes a few small steps towards making the GPS code comprehensible, and then fixes #11955.\n\nThe intentional logic changes are:\n- Map explore now runs at most once per player, triggered the first time that they or one of their allies' GPSWatcher becomes enabled (previously it would happen every time any player enabled or disabled their gps dots by enabling or disabling a radar or tech center)\n- GpsPower &rarr; GPSWatcher updates may be delayed by a tick on capture or building, in exchange for not getting horribly out of sync when capturing while having/not having a radar dome.\n- Frozen actor preview removals no longer requires you _and_ an ally to have an active GPS to run (pretty sure this was an unreported bug)\n- Activating a GPS will now only refresh your allies' state, not all players.  If this code were sensible this would have no impact on the game, but this code is not sensible.  Beware while testing.\n\nI strongly recommend reviewing commit-by-commit to follow the changes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11962/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11961","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11961/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11961/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11961/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11961","id":174910770,"number":11961,"title":"Fix crash when popping up the mod requirements dialog.","user":{"login":"pchote","id":167819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/167819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote","html_url":"https://github.com/pchote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/18","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestone/18","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/18/labels","id":1473743,"number":18,"title":"release-20161015","description":"Stability release with burning trees and video installation.","creator":{"login":"obrakmann","id":4331210,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4331210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann","html_url":"https://github.com/obrakmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":203,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-12-24T15:11:19Z","updated_at":"2016-12-24T14:30:13Z","due_on":"2016-10-16T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-10-16T06:44:16Z"},"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-09-03T18:29:22Z","updated_at":"2016-09-03T21:44:08Z","closed_at":"2016-09-03T21:42:49Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/11961","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11961","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11961.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11961.patch"},"body":"Fixes #11958, but I have no idea how he triggered it from TD.
