are a list of problems I have found in the Red Alert mod\n\nMines/Minelayers\n- Soviet minelayer has too less ammo\n-  Your own infantry and vehicles will trip on your mines\n- Infantry can be killed by Anti vehicle mines\n- The AP mines has too much health you cannot use a minigunner to fire on the floor to find them.\n\nAircraft problems\n- Airfield Aircraft does not start landed on airfield\n- Airplane build is not restricted when airfields are full\n- Airfield is not limited to one aircraft\n- Airfield planes do not return to airfield  automatically when out of ammo\n- MIG has too much ammo\n- Yak payload does not spread when firing (Usually it spreads 4 squares straight)\n- Yak turning radius too large\n- Tanya C4 does not flash on vehicles when placed. \n- Hind cannot be built because helipad is missing for soviets\n- Allies can build hind\n\nSuperweapons\n- A-bomb launch detected is not announced\n- Reinforcement have arrived is not announced when paradrop is used\n- Parabombs are missing for soviets\n- You can aim paradrop in the water and it will drop nothing.\n- Chronosphere is temporary teleports not permanent\n- If infantry is inside an vehicle when chronoshift the infantry disappears.\n- No chronostorm when chronosphere is overused.\n\nVehicle glitches\n- Harvester can get stuck unloading at refinery (Both AI and player)\n- squish command missing (usually hold down ALT and a red cursor appears)\n- Stop noise (beeping) missing when pressing s\n- If  a vehicle force fires on the floor and you move it into the area where it is force firing it can hurt itself and also kill itself.\n- Turrets of heavy tanks face what they last fire at and do not reset to the front of the vehicle\n\nInfantry\n- Grenader warhead is the C&C 95 type not RA one with the fire\n- Engineers do not work (for soviets at least)\n- When the infantry wave they leave their hand up too long (animation rotation)\n- Dogs can jump over concrete when attacking (they should only be able to jump barbed wire)\n- Infantry do not duck when fired upon\n- Medic heal does not make infantry glow\n- When spy infiltrates refinery it should announce credits stolen\n- Tanya does not laugh when she exits vehicle\n\nBuildings\n- Service depot animation too fast\n- Power off does not work on most buildings\n- Silos Needed is repeated too often \n- Medic, spy, engineer, and mechanic does nothing inside camo pillbox should be default\n- Superweapon building animations missing (ie opening of missile silo)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6296","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6296/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6296/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6296/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/6296","id":40787110,"number":6296,"title":"Fixes
