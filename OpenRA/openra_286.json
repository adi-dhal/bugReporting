played a multiplayer game and i placed two power plants side by side pretty fast at the start of the match, later I got some damaged vehicles that I thought I should repair so I built a repair pad. Once the building was completed and was about to place the building I saw that it would be a good match between these buildings I built earlier, but something strange happened. The vehicle got stuck, the only solution I found to this was to sell the repair pad but I lost some money and time on it. So I decided to write a bug report about this issue.\n\n![untitled](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7798635/3184375/2149cc82-ec83-11e3-898c-734b5b6e4b1d.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5553/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5552","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5552/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5552/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5552/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5552","id":35031210,"number":5552,"title":"Concrete

would be great if you could use the keyboard to queue 5 units at a time.\n\nTake building a rifleman (shortcut key = `i`) as an example.
