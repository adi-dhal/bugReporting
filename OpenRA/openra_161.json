Somebody said to me that the fire ants just used the red of soviets.\n\nIf you imagine 2 player using an ant faction this simple recoloring might not work. I Suggest the eyes of the ants should be the player color and the rest should give information about the kind of ant. I Don't know if that is possible. and this might also require some new ant.shps.\n\nAnyway here is the big idea:\n- Create a mobile construction ant queen by modifying the queen asset that can deploy to an anthill (Maybe unable to undeploy) . Yes that's not easy, and we might need a 3d approache here. Any 3dsmax artist volunteers?\n- The queen assest has tiny wings, so she might can fly?\n- Create some very basic ant buildings: Anthill (6cell),  SmallAntHill(4cell barraks&refinery), Anthole (1cell powerplant)\n- Giant ants should take the roll as harvesters and also as an early attack uni, build able only at the 6cell hill\n- Giant ants can unload the ore at the 6cell and 4cell anthill holes\n- The ant hole building could be something like an air condition hole and give few power, that you need to build a lot of them. (1cell building). Maybe adding some little building range to it to get them spread out like crazy basewalk.\n- The 4cell ant hill can produce fire ants, warriors and queens\n- Ants need something to counters air, maybe a fourth flying ant unit that's like a longbow, \n  or only queens can be used as anti air. not yet sure...\n- Buildings will need some building in Progress Animations this is where the larvae could get used\n- I thought about using larvae as resources or like zerg larvae (but I'm against that)\n- I also don't like that the queen used the tesla zap.\n\nYeah, something like that.\n\nconcept of a 4Cell: Ant hill  \n![screenshot 2015-09-05 01 33 36](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5147014/9806918/b2288510-584b-11e5-955c-c39ca71b6f6c.png)\n\nbtw: if you have any other ant stuff. drop

The best shot at reproducing it is shooting at various directions on the ground with bazooka infantry.\nIt can be reproduced more reliably with my `BallisticMissile` projectile in TDX (even the old betas from May), where it actually happens more often. That also means it is not a recent regression, but probably never (visibly) triggers in the shipping mods because in the 3 shipping mods missiles usually start at rather low altitude already and reach Z = 0 before \"CloseEnough\" triggers due to the Tan flight curve.\nBut the higher the projectile speed and starting altitude (or the lower the MaximumPitch), the more likely the issue comes up.\n\nThe issue becomes much more frequent and reproducable with #8717 as well, due to the different flight curve.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9308/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9307","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9307/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9307/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9307/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9307","id":105679484,"number":9307,"title":"Make some navigation keys available to spectators","user":{"login":"obrakmann","id":4331210,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4331210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann","html_url":"https://github.com/obrakmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2015-09-09T20:37:14Z","updated_at":"2015-11-11T07:28:59Z","closed_at":"2015-09-26T10:30:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/9307","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9307","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9307.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9307.patch"},"body":"This will make the following keys available to spectators and in replays:\n- Center screen on last event/beacon [Space]\n- Center screen on current selection [Home]\n- Cycle construction yards [H]\n- Cycle production buildings [Tab]\n\nThe latter two need a player view to work, the former two work in all views.\n\nWe may or may not want the first commit, please discuss.
