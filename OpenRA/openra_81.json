(off on default) ... to force people to build concrete .. otherwise they cant place buildings on the ground\n\nthis would put all players on the same starting-conditions without having them avoid a \"main-aspect\" of the dune-games ... and further more this could actually help defusing the early (and fast) trike/raider rushes ... as everyone should be able (in theory) to have the same amount of time  to produce counter - units\n\ni discussed that already with @x-a-n-a-x and @MustaphaTR ... here : http://logs.openra.net/?year=2016&month=07&day=25#08:55:38\n\ni would be actually interested especially on the opinion of @Nyerguds on this issue \n\nalso @SoScared and @TheRaffy should add their mustard on this matter , as this option would effect both d2k and d2 \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11717","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11717/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11717/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11717/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11717","id":167517446,"number":11717,"title":"OpenRA refuses to launch after detecting OpenGL 1.1 support despite system supporting OpenGL 2.1.","user":{"login":"aaronfranke","id":1646875,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1646875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronfranke","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronfranke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronfranke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronfranke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronfranke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronfranke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronfranke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronfranke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronfranke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronfranke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronfranke/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382357,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Crash","name":"Crash","color":"e10c02","default":false},{"id":189987508,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/OS:%20Windows","name":"OS: Windows","color":"5e9fe7","default":false},{"id":95646850,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Question%20/%20Support","name":"Question / Support","color":"d4c5f9","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-07-26T04:13:16Z","updated_at":"2016-07-31T06:20:25Z","closed_at":"2016-07-27T07:42:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"OS: Windows 10, GPU: Intel Mobile 965 Express Chipset Family\n\nOpenRA: release-20160508\n\nIntel only officially supports OpenGL 1.1 on this GPU but it is simple to add unofficial support for OpenGL 2.1. This works for launching Minecraft 1.10.2, which requires OpenGL 2.1, and Minecraft 1.10.2 does not launch on the drivers Intel provides. However, OpenRA refuses to try to launch due to it incorrectly detecting the maximum OpenGL version. I am confident that if OpenRA skipped this check and launched anyway then it would work fine. \n\nA fix for this issue could simply be to check for the Intel Mobile 965 Express Chipset Family GPU and ignore whatever the detected OpenGL version is and instead assume that it is 2.1.\n\nexception.log: \n\n> Operating System: Windows (Microsoft Windows NT 6.2.9200.0)\n> Runtime Version: .NET CLR 4.0.30319.42000\n> Exception of type `System.InvalidOperationException`: No suitable renderers were found.

This means the path finder now makes sure that an attack can be executed so jumping over cliffs and other glitches are gone.\n\nThe insta-kill is also not a hard-coded hack, but using the regular weapon system. This means we can also armor soldiers accordingly so they only take damage from a hit for a more fine grained balancing. For now the weapon is a high speed bullet like all the other melee attacks, but we can change this into a close combat \"projectile\" later on to avoid the overhead.\n\nI also tried to adhere to our modular https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Actor-Upgrades system instead of putting everything into a monolithic one-purpose trait. The `UpgradeOnTarget` trait can be used to recreate http://cnc.wikia.com/wiki/Terrorist_(Generals) style units and I guess creative modders will find a lot of uses for `UpgradeOnAttack` I didn't even think of yet.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11715/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11714","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11714/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11714/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11714/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11714","id":167387827,"number":11714,"title":"[RA] Official Map Pool: Northwest Passage (2 players) -

original mission converted from the [C# mission code found in release-20131223](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/release-20131223/OpenRA.Mods.RA/Missions/Allies04Script.cs). My favorite one as it tells a good story without relying on too much text and has a nice attention to detail. The intro sequence is very hard, but it works well in co-operative settings with one player already guiding the newbie. It is also exciting (and hilarious) for spectators to watch.\n\nRegarding features it was way ahead of it's time, but relied a lot on non-reusable hacks and suffered from missing engine features. It even had civilians walking around randomly which we just introduced in https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11520 for all maps and mods. I managed to replace all expensive checks with triggers and made use of the global palette effect from https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7863 to create the dawn lighting.\n\nThis should be very faithful to the original. The only behavioral change I introduced is to let the spy \"hotwire\" (externally capture) the truck. Afterwards all spies can enter regularly. This avoids fragile script workarounds. Capturing would destroy the spy actor and `LoadPassenger` will duplicate it, leading to an inconsistent world state.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11702/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11701","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11701/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11701/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11701/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11701","id":167218898,"number":11701,"title":"[RA]
