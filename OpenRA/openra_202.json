the time (when im writing this idea down) ... we currently cant access openra-ressource center , because of technical issues ... so ... this is quite a pain for \"ingame\" admins ... loading maps which cant get installed by players (if they didnt download them before the server-issue) ... this should show up \"immediately\" ... so the admin is informed about the players status about the requirements...\n\n---\n\nadministrator [or the whole lobby] should see if a player does not meet the requirements to ready up ... the reason being , for simple just not having the map (so he still has to click on the install button) or being unable to download a map cause ... unknown , broken ... ressource center not available etc. \n\nthis way we could track faster down people that are \"afk\" ... or just dont fullfill the requirements right now ( theres a difference which often comes out when all players are finally ready , except one ... )\n\nfor more fancy stuff (i know this was allready a idea in the past)  , the same graphical indicator could be replaced by a different one ... showing up when the player (or administrator) doesnt have any activity in the OpenRA window for about 1-3 minutes (as desired) aka ... being \"afk\" ... \nthis way , players wouldnt wait in a lobby for a administrator to show up ... they just change the server immidiatly ... cause sometimes theres admins just sitting in a lobby doing nothing \n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on

for [issue #3001](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3001): replacing disconnected clients with bots.\n\n**Logic:**\n\nServer drops player and send command \"ActivateBot\"\nGame admin activates bot, notification in chat about this showed for everybody\n\n**Detailed:**\n\n(Option is enabled)\n1. A player got dropped while a game is in progress.\n2. Server doesn't send \"player quit\" packet (0xBF).\n3. But it sends \"Disconnected\" instant message as usually - clients show \"player disconnected\" message.\n4. Just after that server sends \"ActivateBot\" instant message.\n- All clients (including admin) change their configuration so disconnected client is treated in the same way like it was a bot activated on the admin on start.\n- It doesn't meter if dropped client had or had not sent packages for recent frames - clients will not check for them after this point (also look at explanation of third commit lower).\n- All clients show \"bot activated for <player name>\" message\n- Admin activates bot\n\nCurrently nothing will show that a player was real client and then was replaced by a bot except server chat message. Statistics will include combined player and bot progress after game end.\n\nPlease check spelling, especially for strings, variable names, code style, caveats.\n\nI introduced:\n\"ActivateBot\" command from server to clients\n\"Autopilot\" string parameter in GlobalSettings which is a bot name if feature is enabled, null otherwise\n\"autopilot <bot name>\" command from the admin to the lobby to enable option\n\"disable_autopilot\" to disable\n\nPlease check implementation of the options gui. Do you have any cautions, will it work with specific maps (like scripted), foresights of bugs while player interact with the option in the lobby?\n\n**Commits explanations (also look at the diffs and messages):**\n\nCommit [1 of 4](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/commit/91491277ba9c3c21a0cb1a9b1d2bee18e2e5f00d):\n- I didn't found any pattern for entries order for game options fields in lobby yaml, so I reordered them to follow left to right, line after line. That helped me in future changes.\n- Some source and resource files had had execute bit on. It doesn't mean anything on windows, but that doesn't look pretty under *nix, so fixed some. On *nix you can check for that with `find -executable -type f` or `find -executable -type f -not -name '\\*.sh' -not -path './.git/\\*' -not -path './configure'` or auto fix with `find -executable -type f -name '\\*.cs' | xargs chmod a-x` \n\nCommit [2 of 4](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/commit/626493676dbc47c272d56055d895e78c5b6f1b42):\n- Added Session.Admin (LobbyInfo.Admin) as shortcut to `Clients.FirstOrDefault(c => c.IsAdmin)` to remove a small repetition.\n- In OpenRA.Game/Server/Server.cs:DropClient() moved toDrop.Socket.Disconnect(false) at the beginning of the function ([#L525](https://github.com/mtarranger/OpenRA/blob/626493676dbc47c272d56055d895e78c5b6f1b42/OpenRA.Game/Server/Server.cs#L525)). As far as I can see it doesn't break anything, but this removes the feeling that if somehow processing will become multi-threaded, disconnecting client will have a possibility to change something after server prepared to disconnect him and actual disconnect.\n- Mono doesn't respect HOME environment variable, and I didn't want to use Support directory. So I added OPENRASUPPORTDIR environment variable, which is path to already existing directory where logs, settings and other should be saved. Where should I write its description? Additionally there should be a command line option for this in future.\n\nCommit [3 of 4 (network code)](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/commit/20e467ecb35a3f2d08964d4cb949350f4cf57785):\n- In order to set up real client info like it is a bot client, client id should be removed from FrameData.clientQuitTimes ([#L35](https://github.com/mtarranger/OpenRA/blob/20e467ecb35a3f2d08964d4cb949350f4cf57785/OpenRA.Game/Network/FrameData.cs#L35)). This also excludes the client from IsReadyForNextFrame checks but doesn't affect FrameData.framePackets which holds any available order packets for disconnected client. The logic I chose implies that FrameData.clientQuitTimes is just optimization for checks who's playing and not for journaling purposes and can be freely modified.\n\nCommit [4 of 4 (gui code)](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/commit/09bfb29ef33f15131fcb930b5133887c86029009):\nNothing special.\n\nThe projects code is very nice but it lacks comments (and self descriptive names doesn't always work).\n\nIMHO network code and logic is a bit messy and requires some rewriting. The servers code becomes entangled.\n\nWidgets logic code (at least in OpenRA.Mods.Common/Widgets/Logic/Lobby/) also a bit messy and a bit self repetitive.\n\n**Conceptual questions:**\n- Should autopilot be in map options? (Currently a map cannot set autopilot option)\n- Can the removal of disconnected client id from FrameData.clientQuitTimes (described above in third commit) interfere with replay possibility? As it seems, replay will log \"Disconnected\", \"ActivateBot\" messages and will change FrameData.clientQuitTimes during replay as it happened during the game.\n- Player name remain unchanged after the replacement (only chat message notes about replacement). I can change that if you want. In my understanding there are forces on the map that have names, and they are ruled by its command. I'd suggest that when a bot activated for a player bot type written in parenthesis after the player name, and when a bot added in the lobby it added with name \"Bot\".\n- Also what should be BotControllerClientIndex if game doesn't have admins (dedicated, dropped)? I used `BotControllerClientIndex = admin == null ? 0 : admin.Index` ([#L90](https://github.com/mtarranger/OpenRA/blob/20e467ecb35a3f2d08964d4cb949350f4cf57785/OpenRA.Game/Network/UnitOrders.cs#L90)). Should it be -1 or other special?\n\n**Random remarks** (that arose during the work):\n- There are a couple of places where FirstOrDefault is used without further check if the result is null. Like in OpenRA.Mods.Common/Widgets/Logic/Lobby/LobbyLogic.cs:LobbyLogic.LobbyLogic(), variable botController ([#L193](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/b4fa704fbd61a8d66641f730adff5c9a43bdd498/OpenRA.Mods.Common/Widgets/Logic/Lobby/LobbyLogic.cs#L193), [#L576](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/b4fa704fbd61a8d66641f730adff5c9a43bdd498/OpenRA.Mods.Common/Widgets/Logic/Lobby/LobbyLogic.cs#L576), changed from `LobbyInfo.Clients.FirstOrDefault(c => c.IsAdmin)` to `LobbyInfo.Admin` in my commits but it's the same) or in LobbyUtils.cs ([#L55](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/b4fa704fbd61a8d66641f730adff5c9a43bdd498/OpenRA.Mods.Common/Widgets/Logic/Lobby/LobbyUtils.cs#L55))\n- All \"Send*\" and \"Dispatch*\" in OpenRA.Game/Server/[Server.cs](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/626493676dbc47c272d56055d895e78c5b6f1b42/OpenRA.Game/Server/Server.cs#L409) should be rethinked and rewritten.\n- IsHost on clients and IsAdmin on server are ambiguous. At first thought IsHost should be true if client hosting a game, not dedicated server, and any one in the lobby can be selected as IsAdmin. Now they are used as the same thing.\n- I would suggest to add in OpenRA.Game/Network/[FrameData.cs](https://github.com/mtarranger/OpenRA/blob/20e467ecb35a3f2d08964d4cb949350f4cf57785/OpenRA.Game/Network/FrameData.cs#L29),\n  \n  ```\n  AddClient(clientId)\n  {\n  clientQuitTimes.Add(clientId, 0x7FFFFFFF)\n  }\n  ```\n  \n  as a way to tell FrameData that the clients packages is required for a next frame, and in OpenRA.Game/Network/[OrderManager.cs](https://github.com/mtarranger/OpenRA/blob/20e467ecb35a3f2d08964d4cb949350f4cf57785/OpenRA.Game/Network/OrderManager.cs#L85),\n  \n  ```\n  WaitForClient(client)\n  {\n  frameData.AddClient(clientId)\n  }\n  ```\n  \n  for same reason, and remove `DispatchOrdersToClient(c, d.PlayerIndex, 0x7FFFFFFF, new byte[] { 0xBF });` from server (OpenRA.Game/Server/[Server.cs#L677](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/b4fa704fbd61a8d66641f730adff5c9a43bdd498/OpenRA.Game/Server/Server.cs#L677)).\n  \n  But this should be a part of network code rewrite.\n  \n  WaitForClient can probably be called from one of GameStarted. Additionaly notifications (using interfaces) can be used for client disconnect/replacement.\n- It's better to separate message strings from code (like in OpenRA.Mods.Common/Widgets/Logic/Lobby/[LobbyLogic.cs](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/b4fa704fbd61a8d66641f730adff5c9a43bdd498/OpenRA.Mods.Common/Widgets/Logic/Lobby/LobbyLogic.cs#L414)), although I understand it should be done after internationalization will be implemented.\n- Usage and meaning of Actor, IActor and others *Actor* in the project is a bit confusing, at least without comments (too many too different types of \"actors\").\n- Order.PauseGame() (OpenRA.Game/Network/[Order.cs, #L150](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/b4fa704fbd61a8d66641f730adff5c9a43bdd498/OpenRA.Game/Network/Order.cs#L150)) and PlayerCommands.InvokeCommand() (OpenRA.Mods.Common/Commands/[PlayerCommands.cs, #L43](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/b4fa704fbd61a8d66641f730adff5c9a43bdd498/OpenRA.Mods.Common/Commands/PlayerCommands.cs#L43)) contains same code `new Order(\"PauseGame\", null, false) ...`. What's the right location? Also `new Order(\"Surrender\", ...` in 2 places (OpenRA.Mods.Common/Commands/[PlayerCommands.cs, #L49](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/b4fa704fbd61a8d66641f730adff5c9a43bdd498/OpenRA.Mods.Common/Commands/PlayerCommands.cs#L49), OpenRA.Mods.Common/Widgets/Logic/Ingame/[IngameMenuLogic.cs, #L75](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/b4fa704fbd61a8d66641f730adff5c9a43bdd498/OpenRA.Mods.Common/Widgets/Logic/Ingame/IngameMenuLogic.cs#L75))\n- Flag numbers from network communication (like `0xBF`) can be put to constants with meaningful names (like FrameData.Markers.LastSeen or anything)\n- OpenRA.Order.Deserialize() (OpenRA.Game/Network/[Order.cs, #L94](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/b4fa704fbd61a8d66641f730adff5c9a43bdd498/OpenRA.Game/Network/Order.cs#L94)) and OpenRA.Server.ServerOrder.Deserialize() (OpenRA.Game/Server/[ServerOrder.cs, #L38](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/b4fa704fbd61a8d66641f730adff5c9a43bdd498/OpenRA.Game/Server/ServerOrder.cs#L38)) contains same code. Maybe it's better to move read/write code to something like OrderFormat or change meaning of current names.\n- Maybe strings in clients-server communication from OpenRA.Mods.Common (\"TeamChat\", \"HandshakeRequest\", \"SyncInfo\", ...) should be constants with special byte value (0x01 0x01, 0x01 0x02, ...)? Or at least string constants with current values and corresponding names to avoid typing mistakes?\n- As it seems, meaning of Requires<T> (OpenRA.Game/Traits/TraitsInterfaces.cs) isn't documented anywhere, however it's usefull feature for mods.\n- I think trait *.cs files in some directories can be placed more structured. Trait interfaces inside TraitsInterfaces.cs also (at least more sorted).\n- Ending of OpenRA.Game/[Sync.cs](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/b4fa704fbd61a8d66641f730adff5c9a43bdd498/OpenRA.Game/Sync.cs#L167) really needs comments. It looks like after the first successful fn execution inUnsyncedCode will never be false again.\n- ./configure and make functionality is confusing. Typically configure creates Makefile configured to use tools available on platform and build with options set by configure. There is Makefile out of the box but compilation will fail because there is no Eluant.dll.config which is created by configure. `make` should fail with sensible message about configure wasn't executed or it should be changed to fulfill its task when called.\n  I suggest either to remove configure at all and move its functionality to Makefile or rewrite configure so it will:\n  - Detect platform libraries\n  - Detect third-party libraries download method (is there nuget available or curl/wget should be used to download from `https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/package/$packageName/$packageVersion`. I did it with curl)\n  - Write configs, scripts and Makefile\n- I suggest OPENRAMODSDIR environment variable and command line option to point to custom mods directory location.\n- Also at least short --help, -h and /? command line option would be nice.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8059/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4798","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"85A9:572C:15DA519:2B689FB:59D6B53A","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=203>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=405>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=201>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"8a96ec033c96e5351284b72f6bb8d91e\"","status":"200 OK"}}
