Firing offsets are defined on each turret/weapon, and you can have any number of weapons distributed arbitrarily over any number of turrets.\n\nI'm putting this up for review, but it shouldn't be merged until the following are resolved:\n- WeaponMount is a dumb trait name, and should be changed (suggestions welcome). Weapon is unavailable because of a naming clash with GameRules.WeaponInfo.\n- I've only modified the yaml for C&C and RA. D2k, the classic mods, and custom maps still need updating.\n\nAttackBase.CanAttackGround should probably be moved to the weapon definition in weapons.yaml. Opinions for/against?
