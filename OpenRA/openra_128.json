The tiles that need new/adjusted artwork I was thinking of duplicating with a similar existing tile already in that tileset. This would allow artistic contributors to change the artwork in future while keeping yaml code changes to a minimum (if any).\n\nIn the long term though, I _think_ this could evolve into a theatre selection option in the map lobby. Perhaps with a random default setting. Throw in a small chance to have the new weather effects play for each theatre and you have a way to make all maps seem a little different each time.\n\nIs this actually realistic

the RA1 mod particularly, we ship many 1v1 maps that I feel are not balanced. Although competitive maps are trickling into the resource centre and are slowly being added to the official pool, we have had a number of competitive tournaments where official maps have been used.\n\nI think we should update some of the more unbalanced maps to match our current drive of unit balancing. At the same time, I think we should also increase the aesthetics of the much older maps.\n\nI am _not_ suggesting that maps should be redone to be perfectly symmetrical or such. I do feel however that oRA's gameplay has evolved over time to provide some unique gameplay mechanics and quirks that now cause issues on some maps.\n\n-Base walking to initial ore patches within CY build radius\n-Ore mine distance to REFs, accounting for northern REF disadvantage\n-Distances to expansions, attack range distances and tech buildings\n\nI will be creating some PR's to show off some changes I am proposing to remedy this.
