The difference for `Common` would be negligible, but this would make the \"Can this mod/map use trait X that is from mod Y?\" issues a lot better.\n\n> [23:23:58]< chrisf> things that turn out to be useful will move into common code and slowly get more general\n> [23:24:17]  < Phrohdoh> certainly, but where do we draw the line?\n> [23:24:40]  < chrisf> im not sold on there _being_ a line for things like traits.\n> [23:24:50]  < Phrohdoh> Then we should just have a mods.dll\n> [23:24:52]  < chrisf> if you have some weird ui junk, sure, keep that in your own dll \n\nI know we've talked about splitting `Common` to \"graphics stuff\" vs \"logic\", or \"sprite stuff\" vs \"voxel stuff\" or whatever. Maybe we can dump all the stuff in `Common` first. Then have `Activities.dll`, `Traits.dll`, `Traits.Render.dll`, etc. or whatever we name them.\n\nAt this point I am not sure how much point there is to have per-mod DLLs (custom mods of course will add their own logic in their own DLLs) for the official mods, considering how little code they actually contain.\n\nOpening this for discussion. I particularly want to hear what @reaperrr and @GraionDilach think about this, as people with their own mods, because I think this will affect them. Of course we need opinions from the other people interested/involved/capable on commenting on the project's architecture.\n\n(I'm not going to label this issue for now because it's a `Question` that I hope will quickly move to an `Idea` about a `Refactor`.)\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/25195875-unite-mod-dlls?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8850/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8849","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8849/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8849/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8849/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8849","id":98287946,"number":8849,"title":"Completely replace OpenRA.Test with OpenRA.Utility.exe or Support It","user":{"login":"atlimit8","id":4957137,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4957137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8","html_url":"https://github.com/atlimit8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":95646850,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Question%20/%20Support","name":"Question / Support","color":"d4c5f9","default":false},{"id":33146668,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Refactor","name":"Refactor","color":"00FFCC","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":17,"created_at":"2015-07-30T23:48:55Z","updated_at":"2015-11-21T13:33:07Z","closed_at":"2015-11-21T13:33:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It seems that `OpenRA.Test` does not provide much functionality and I have issues with running it on my system:\n`dmcs -t:library -out:OpenRA.Test.dll OpenRA.Test/OpenRA.Game/*.cs -r:mods/common/OpenRA.Mods.Common.dll -r:OpenRA.Game.exe -r:nunit.framework.dll -r:System.dll -r:System.Core.dll -r:System.Data.dll -r:System.Data.DataSetExtensions.dll -r:System.Drawing.dll -r:System.Xml.dll -r:thirdparty/download/ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.dll -r:thirdparty/download/FuzzyLogicLibrary.dll -r:thirdparty/download/Mono.Nat.dll -r:thirdparty/download/MaxMind.Db.dll -r:thirdparty/download/MaxMind.GeoIP2.dll -r:thirdparty/download/Eluant.dll && nunit-console OpenRA.Test.dll`\nresults in:\n\n```\nOpenRA.Test/OpenRA.Game/ActorInfoTest.cs(67,9): warning CS0219: The variable `i' is assigned but its value is never used\nOpenRA.Test/OpenRA.Game/ActorInfoTest.cs(88,9): warning CS0219: The variable `i' is assigned but its value is never used\nCompilation succeeded - 2 warning(s)\nNUnit version 2.4.8\nCopyright (C) 2002-2007 Charlie Poole.\nCopyright (C) 2002-2004 James W.
