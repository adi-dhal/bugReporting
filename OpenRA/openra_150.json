When 26ce7b5e1c3e6f8c7eaf359e14faaedf9954e470 fixed the map enumeration the code ended attaching bridges to the wrong ends of eachother, and this flowed on to the bridge huts being connected wrong.\n\nThis fix inverts the assumption above so that bridges are assumed to spawn north-to-south (which matches what we do), but the whole method is bogus and really should be rewritten at some point.\n\nFixes #9592.\nFixes
