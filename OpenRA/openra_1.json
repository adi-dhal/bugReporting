One suggestion that has been touted by myself and others is to remove the ability for units to see and therefore auto attack into the fog of war at gpsdots. \r\n\r\nIt can get silly for artillery to auto fire at assembling units long before their commander even notices what's going on. Also, as many RA units have greater firing range than their vision range, an allied player with GPS will get free shots off in most engagements. Tanya in particular can wreak havoc un-escorted with a simple A-move vs infantry dots.\r\n\r\nRelated forum post:

now cargo/passengers can be ordered to go into transports but transports can not be ordered to pick up their cargo/passengers. Such feature exists in other RTS (Starcraft for example) and can be very useful. \r\n\r\nImagine how much easier it will be to pick up stranded engineers (or Tanya). Now you have to first move the transport to where the passenger is and then order the passenger in (if you don't forget that you sent that transport in the first place). It can be extra useful if combined with queued orders - drive to the passenger, pick up, drive off to somewhere else with the passenger on board.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/14108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/14107","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/14107/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/14107/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/14107/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/14107","id":262401282,"number":14107,"title":"Added

currently don't require BaseProvider, which allows players to exploit game mechanics by building walls far away from an MCV. \r\nThere are a couple ways I've seen this play out. 1) A player can use it by dropping a rax or power plant and moving on, then walling off a choke. 2) A player can hinder an advance after losing their MCV if buildings are still nearby. \r\n\r\nFrom IRC: \r\n```\r\n[20:24:23] | <pchote> Smitty_: allowing walls to go outside the build radius was a deliberate decision\r\n[20:24:33] | <pchote> for reasons that were good at the time, but which I honestly can't remember now\r\n[20:24:52] | <pchote> and which may no longer apply\r\n[20:25:33] | <pchote> possibly that the line build logic couldn't easily be made to handle the various edge cases around it\r\n```\r\nI've tested walls with BaseProvider. Placing them along the periphery worked as expected. #12754 still comes into play from walls outside but that's a separate issue. \r\nIf anyone can remember the reason BaseProvider wasn't applied let me know. If the previous issue is no longer relevant I'd like to go ahead and fix this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/14095/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/14094","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/14094/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/14094/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/14094/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/14094","id":261875991,"number":14094,"title":"Attack helicopters will ignore orders if given queued attacks during rearming.","user":{"login":"FrameLimiter","id":22008761,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/22008761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrameLimiter","html_url":"https://github.com/FrameLimiter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrameLimiter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrameLimiter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrameLimiter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrameLimiter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrameLimiter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrameLimiter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrameLimiter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrameLimiter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrameLimiter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":124732617,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Pathfinding","name":"Pathfinding","color":"4c4c4c","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-09-30T22:11:36Z","updated_at":"2017-10-01T07:17:28Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hind & Longbow:\r\nIf you queue up attack orders on structures while the hind or longbow is returning to rearm.
