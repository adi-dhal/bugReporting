I'm not proposing any code changes to the missiles, only yaml tweaks to get them back/similar to their release version states. **I'm also thinking TS is fine as-is, and this ticket applies only for RA, TD, and D2K**. We had received negative feedback in RA on this during a playtest, can't speak for other mods yet or if it's a concern there.\n\nI have an automated RA test map here https://github.com/cjshmyr/OpenRA/commit/f941a0ed7f58f4fd184258f02ad38dce6893b5f2 that runs on both bleed and release. It should be useful when comparing the two, also when applying any balance changes back to bleed.\n\nI've observed the following for RA:\n- E3 anti-air is better\n- Mammoth anti-air is better\n- Destroyers all-around are better\n- E3 and Chronotank land targeting seems unaffected\n\nNot yet checked SAM sites.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on

other.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10121","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10121/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10121/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10121/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10121","id":119113365,"number":10121,"title":"Fix

Merge dictionaries in GpsDot\n\nThis speeds up GpsDot.Tick as it requires only one dictionary lookup per player rather than two. This change also provides useful infrastructure for later commits.\n\nOn the RA shellmap, this reduces total CPU time spent in GpsDot.Tick from 1.3% to 0.6%.\n## Ensure frozen actors are rendered on the first tick they become visible\n\nFixes a regression from #7734. If we don't render the snapshot for the frozen actor straight away, the actor can continue ticking and we'll take a much newer than intended snapshot and display that instead. This doesn't tend to have bad effects in practise but nonetheless we revert back to using TickRender to get a snapshot at the correct time.\n\nWe still manage to keep the perf benefit of #7734, by only rendering the snapshot once and not again until we need to.\n## Fix GPS dot relying on frozen actor render state\n\nFixes #10155. See the linked issue for more details. Ultimately I have seperated the simulation and render state of the GPS dot from the frozen actor rendering. I have attempted to maintain other behaviour, such as not rendering a GPS dot if there is already a visible frozen actor for it.\n## Fix GPS refreshing for incorrect player\n\nThis was just noticed during the debugging for #10155 as clearly broken behaviour (relying on the render player in simulation code). I'm including a fix here, although we haven't seen this manifest any issues of its own as yet.\n## Please review carefully\n\nSo far, every PR I have ever submitted or reviewed dealing with the frozen actor code has contained major regressions which I did not catch. Anything I've written here has a high chance of being super broken and you should treat it with due scepticism.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10119","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10119/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10119/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10119/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10119","id":119103164,"number":10119,"title":"Interleave renderables for effects and actors","user":{"login":"RoosterDragon","id":3399086,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3399086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon","html_url":"https://github.com/RoosterDragon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":17,"created_at":"2015-11-26T21:23:12Z","updated_at":"2015-12-31T18:43:10Z","closed_at":"2015-12-31T11:31:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/10119","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10119","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10119.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10119.patch"},"body":"Previously, renderables from actors were z-ordered, but effects were excluded and not ordered.

As a side effect, this adds the other half of the plumbing we need to fix #7546 (#9800 adds the first half), and gets us a small step closer to #8917.\n#10070 was introduced by #9327 which gave them a finite selection size.  This meant that the ScreenMap query for actors under the cursor now returned the bridge actor instead of null, and meant that the move cursor and order queries checked against the actor's center position instead of the moused over cell.\n\nThis fix comes in two parts:\n1. Adding a second pass to `UnitOrderGenerator.OrderForUnit` that checks for orders against the cell if there are no valid orders against the actor.\n2. Making move orders invalid for any non-cell targets.\n\nThis fixes the cursor, and allows us to again order actors to any cell in the bridge footprint.  It also fixes the inconsistency where you got a move cursor when mousing over trees, but not over barrels.\n\nThis may have unexpected consequences, so it shouldn't be merged to prep:\n- If there are any cases that relied on move orders against actors being valid when the moused-over cell was invalid but the actor's center position was valid (I don't think we have any code _this_ bogus... although it might affect crushing)\n- If there are any other where we want to prevent orders against cells when there is an un-targetable actor on top.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10117","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10117/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10117/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10117/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10117","id":119072614,"number":10117,"title":"Try

suddenly stanting there doing nothing but takeing hit and died, before they died, I was check they moveing line, which it's still on a red attacking line, but still standing there not fight back, this was a really big problems, especially when you control a huge group on battle, most of them just stay behind getting shot at... each game has a same problems.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10114","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10114/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10114/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10114/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10114","id":118960759,"number":10114,"title":"Grenadier

I found a really big problem about the grenadier, on both red alert and dune 2000, because those grenadier self destruction damage a way too high, which it will kill almost every friendly infantry nearby, most the time the grenadier is with other infantry on combat, and they are going way too front, make them get killed on the frist place, and even worst, if many of them stay together, it will cause chain reaction, make them blow up almost half you infantry group, is way too high on the damage, and most the time they will get killed without even reach the thorwing range or before throwing the grenade, because those problem, the grenadier is become almost useless, almost useless on the crazy ivan on the red alert 2.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty
