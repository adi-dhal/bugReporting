Static defences are still a big investment early game (and can be avoided) so I think camo PBs should be fairly strong early game. Currently players can hold fire their camo pillboxes to lure early infantry rushes closer for maximum kill chance. I wanted to build on this with the very under utilized infantry garrison mechanism.\n\n$400 camo PB (with free $100 rifle) + $300 RS = $600 turret + $100 rifle. \n\nWith the cheaper price and lower tech level I hope to see some interesting RS garrison plays (once #11429 is fixed) to counter early LT and APC blocking strats safely. Although camo PBs still have 200hp more than turrets, turrets fire much faster and have better range so they won't be replaced by camo RS pillboxes.\n\n~~The original pillbox for France still exists unchanged as I felt any changes would make them more likely to be spammed. I left it in to give French players more options if your opponent doesn't know you are playing France. A live decoy as it were.~~\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11431/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11430","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11430/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11430/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11430/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11430","id":159737819,"number":11430,"title":"Air units won't close the distance to attack other air units if ground weapon range is different","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382400,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"d7e102","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-06-10T22:50:10Z","updated_at":"2016-07-01T12:24:41Z","closed_at":"2016-07-01T12:24:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"As was mentioned by @HenrytheSlav in https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11337#issuecomment-221490963 \n\n> it was found that if longbow has two weapons with different ranges, f.e.
