zero while aligned with a coordinate axe. This sonic tank fired straight down, only hittig 3 light inf actors exactly on the path. Firing diagonaly however has the intended AOE.\r\n![sonictank](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16046997/29279106-120a17dc-8117-11e7-98fc-7e110f3ece13.png)\r\n\r\nI think the bug is caused here: (assume line parallel with y-axis)\r\n```\r\nvar xDir = Math.Sign(lineEnd.X - lineStart.X);\r\nvar yDir = Math.Sign(lineEnd.Y - lineStart.Y);\r\n```\r\nMath.Sign retuns 0 if lineEnd.X=lineStart.X **!!**   \r\n```\r\nvar dir = new WVec(xDir, yDir, 0);\r\nvar overselect = dir * (1024 + lineWidth.Length + targetExtraSearchRadius.Length);\r\n\t\t\tvar finalTarget = lineEnd + overselect;\r\n\t\t\tvar finalSource = lineStart - overselect;\r\n\r\nvar actorsInSquare = world.ActorMap.ActorsInBox(finalTarget, finalSource);\r\n```\r\n..which causes overselect to be 0 on x direction and leads to a box with no width (==line). \r\n\r\nA fix could be to catch case lineEnd.X==lineStart.X before Math.Sign() and set xDir=1.\r\nSame for yDir.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13851/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4991","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"CD28:572B:D6670E:1C55188:59D6B24C","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=10>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=405>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=8>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"6c06ed8be7961793870d2093e0b15232\"","status":"200 OK"}}
