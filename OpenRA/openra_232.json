It runs the build on Windows machines using .NET to test our IDE/msbuild project files and the PowerShell scripts. It also runs the NUnit tests from #6797 and stores the results. Yes, some of them are still failing. This may urge us to finally fix the MiniYAML merge code. Also some people had trouble running them https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/6984 so this should simplify it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7164","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7164/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7164/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7164/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7164","id":52601991,"number":7164,"title":"Ported survival02 to lua","user":{"login":"abcdefg30","id":7704140,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7704140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30","html_url":"https://github.com/abcdefg30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":20,"created_at":"2014-12-21T18:15:52Z","updated_at":"2015-01-14T14:25:46Z","closed_at":"2015-01-13T19:16:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/7164","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7164","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7164.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7164.patch"},"body":"What this PR does:\n- Ported survival02 to lua\n- Added a lua functions for airstrikes (spyplane, parabombs)\n- Added a lua function for paratroopers and replaced the \"old paradrop methods\"\n\nStill to do:\n- [x] Teach the lua-c# bridge how to use nullable types (WPos?) -

again guys. Recently a friend on sleipnirstuff noticed after capturing tech from tree factions in my Tiberian Origins mod that you can't build units from the 3rd or 4th side because they are too low on the sidebar and they do not show up. This occurs on\n machines with a resolution of 1366x768 and lower. I had no such problems on my 1920x1080 monitor, but I was able to reproduce the problem on my Asus T100TA. Further clipping occured when I tested the game on a netbook with 1024x600 resolution.\n\nI think this would be fixed if you added a scroll function to the sidebar to accommodate devices with low-resolution screens. \n\n![openra 2014-12-20 21-22-47-95](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6204538/5516010/9ee56eba-888e-11e4-9946-64c52c506437.jpg)\n\n![openra 2014-12-20 21-22-54-25](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6204538/5516016/a8be7120-888e-11e4-9ff2-1c7978e8fc1a.jpg)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4768","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"DF5B:572A:6FB0B4:FB7CB7:59D6B5AF","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=233>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=405>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=231>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"d901715569d8fca0944aca3c2291ab6d\"","status":"200 OK"}}
