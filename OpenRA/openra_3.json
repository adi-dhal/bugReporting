In this way, the amount of Tiberium in an area will increase exponentially. Tiberium patches can be completely de-'forested' temporarily, but will grow back even if the Tiberium is completely removed, due to its underground \"roots\", as well as smaller crystals, that will remain in the soil and become clusters for further crystalline growth.

default arrangement of players when spawns has not been selected helps sorting out spawns for players either not familiar or caring with the lobby's spawn selection system. At the same time it also takes away opportunities for play with maps having more spawn than players that allows the player the excitement of exploring the map in order to locate the enemy.\r\n\r\n![examples](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2715583/30519889-955a0f1c-9ba1-11e7-85b4-c1a44b558122.png) Using examples of the official map pool.\r\n\r\nThis option would also help competitive players with all mods to expand their selection of maps going beyond 1v1 maps. At the start-up of the RA Global League a few 2v2 maps was added to the map pool only to later realize the players by default spawning on polar opposite sides on the maps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/14041/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/14040","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/14040/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/14040/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/14040/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/14040","id":258292359,"number":14040,"title":"Added map Grassy Knoll","user":{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-09-17T09:57:44Z","updated_at":"2017-09-17T17:35:24Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/14040","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/14040","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/14040.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/14040.patch"},"body":"Another map that should be not too fancy #12518 and playable already.

I assume the invalid map rules chcks are expensive as that seems to be a problem elsewhere. To reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Load the TS mod (almost all of the maps have custom rules)\r\n2. Change the map\r\n3. Immediately click start game\r\n4. You get kicked from your own game\r\n\r\nTo avoid the problem you have to click change map, wait several seconds (on my machine) until the map actually changes. Then hit start game. It is quite annoying. Not sure if the start game button should be greyed out during map change actions or other countermeasures should take care of it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/14031/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4997","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"CCCE:572A:6F2C04:FA5396:59D6B234","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=4>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=405>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=2>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"b59fd8fd2c8965211457ebed8ec574ef\"","status":"200 OK"}}
