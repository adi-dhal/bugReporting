Also eliminates having to shift click spam a black screen to get around this. \n- If playing random spawns, you no longer have to pan the screen in four different directions to figure out where the map border is (and hence your spawn position)\n- No more memorizing a map for REF placement, tech buildings, debris / ore in the spawn blocking building placement etc. No more shift click spamming scouts just to uncover the map - now you can focus on scouting the enemy and countering their scouts.\n- No longer at a disadvantage on new maps so you can focus on just playing. Much less frustrating to try different tactics like changing your initial MCV deployment and rushes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11531/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11530","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11530/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11530/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11530/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11530","id":162295456,"number":11530,"title":"[RA] Official Map Pool: Alter Bombardment Islands (6 players) -

to GraionDilach for pointing this out to me but HackyAI will exclude MCVs and harvesters from squads but otherwise will add any available units to squads including possibility unarmed utility units like the Manticore faction in my mod, Phoenix Chronicles, has. So I have an AI that will send power-generating unarmed trucks and it's HQ among other base-units into battle. This gives a modder a way to make units with the sole purpose of being around the base. Could be useful for the mobile repair vehicle for Nod in TS.\n\nNo test case included, but I did test it before pushing by adding like 90% of the unit roster to the exclusion list. Nothing included appeared to be put into a squad.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11512/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11511","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11511/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11511/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11511/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11511","id":161881012,"number":11511,"title":"D2k: Add Cliffmaze 1v1 map by S.D.","user":{"login":"OmegaBolt","id":8225171,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8225171?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaBolt","html_url":"https://github.com/OmegaBolt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaBolt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaBolt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaBolt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaBolt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaBolt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaBolt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaBolt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaBolt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaBolt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-06-23T09:43:05Z","updated_at":"2016-06-23T19:16:58Z","closed_at":"2016-06-23T19:14:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/11511","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11511","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11511.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11511.patch"},"body":"![cliffmaze](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8225171/16298845/406bc3e0-392f-11e6-946d-080d01c38f57.png)\n\nThis is a small 1v1 map with a maze-like cliff layout between bases.
