#10907.\n\nCurrently, if you have multiple dependencies for a trait, as long as one of them is created first then the ordering is satisfied. This means the others might be created after the thing that requires them!\n\nNow, we strengthen the rules to require all of the dependencies to be created up front. This means the dependent can now guarantee all its dependencies are ready, rather than just at least one.\n\nI have adjusted the tests to verify this.\n\nThis created some circular dependency chains on `UpgradeManager` in the default mods which I have resolved by doing the trait lookups after the actor is created. Without this RA and D2k fail to load.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10965/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10964","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10964/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10964/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10964/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10964","id":142594899,"number":10964,"title":"Fix TakeCover dependence on AttackTurreted.","user":{"login":"GraionDilach","id":1136302,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1136302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach","html_url":"https://github.com/GraionDilach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-03-22T09:40:26Z","updated_at":"2016-03-22T19:11:50Z","closed_at":"2016-03-22T19:11:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/10964","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10964","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10964.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10964.patch"},"body":"Fixes #10962.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10964/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10963","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10963/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10963/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10963/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10963","id":142482909,"number":10963,"title":"Rework map data load/save.","user":{"login":"pchote","id":167819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/167819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote","html_url":"https://github.com/pchote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-03-21T21:57:28Z","updated_at":"2016-03-26T18:28:47Z","closed_at":"2016-03-26T18:24:45Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/10963","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10963","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10963.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10963.patch"},"body":"This reorganizes the map fields into a semblance of order, and, where possible, makes them readonly or `{ private set; }`.
