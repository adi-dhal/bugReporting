discussed on the IRC channel, these are some ideas for improving the renderer, I'm quite illiterate when it comes to programming so I don't know how much work any of these would be, as such I make no requests, but these are listed for posterity's sake. \r\n\r\nI would love to hear feedback from the devs if any of these are achievable during the current reworking the renderer is getting. I would also be interested in learning to code at some point to implement some of these.\r\n\r\n1. Alpha channel\r\nA separate alpha channel would allow for anti-aliasing, pre-rendered motion blur (rotors, explosions), true transparency (fire, explosions, flares, glows etc), overlay animations (beach waves, wind). Perhaps this could also be utilized to somehow make terrain more interesting through a secondary terrain layer that could be essentially brushed over the base tiles. I personally believe this is has the most use out of all the points.\r\n\r\n2. Normals channel\r\nThe combination of a normals, depth and alpha with dynamic lighting, which I assume is happening for TS, would allow for relighting of objects in game taking into consideration the objects' shapes, I'm not sure how computationally expensive that is however, I think that's the most ambitious point, with probably the least return for most projects, although it would be very cool to see games with explosions/muzzles that affect their surroundings and Nomad Galaxy with planets that are lit ingame by the stars.\r\n\r\n3. Different formats support\r\nShps and Westwood PALs are a PITA to work with, the tools are limited, broken and not intuitive. I can see some modders migrating from TS/RA2 to OpenRA once TS is implemented, but it's hard to imagine anyone outside of this community doing so with the current formats.\r\nWhether this format is 8 or 32 bit doesn't matter much especially since we can use virtually limitless palettes . Although I'm sure some people would like to have more colors to work with.\r\n\r\n4. Terrain Creation\r\nThis is a more complex point and I don't have a crystallized thought on this yet, but I would imagine there are better/easier ways to create terrain than fixed cell sizes. This was briefly touched upon in the IRC channel and sparked my interest. Any ideas would probably have to keep it friendly to the mapmakers themselves.\r\nThis is a quite interesting approach https://ppmforums.com/viewtopic.php?t=41860\r\nAnd if it can be combined with alpha channels as \"brushes\"might even be more interesting, but I would love to hear if anyone has ideas.\r\nAnother example, of something completely different is Nomad Galaxy again, while the approach above could be useful, a background image or procedural generators could be even more powerful, especially when you combine that with alpha channels and parallax scrolling for different layers of space \"objects\".\r\n\r\nWarman","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13245/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13244","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13244/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13244/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13244/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13244","id":226571719,"number":13244,"title":"OpenRA Manifest - Windows supported versions","user":{"login":"rob-v","id":16348750,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/16348750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v","html_url":"https://github.com/rob-v","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":117739713,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Changes%20requested","name":"PR: Changes requested","color":"e11d21","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-05-05T13:23:06Z","updated_at":"2017-05-30T08:47:39Z","closed_at":"2017-05-30T08:47:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/13244","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13244","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13244.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13244.patch"},"body":"Closes #13243 (OS Version returns 10.0.* instead of 9.2.* on Win 10)\r\n\r\n(Note: in the .manifest file is also commented setting dpiAware - Indicates that the application is DPI-aware and will not be automatically scaled by Windows at higher DPIs)\r\n\r\nWith the release of Windows 8.1, the behavior of the GetVersionEx API has changed in the value it will return for the operating system version.

makes \r\n- the two relevant warheads use the largest health radius for victim scans\r\n- all blockable projectiles use the largest health radius of an actor with `IBlocksProjectilesInfo` for normal blocker scans\r\n- bouncing `Bullet`s use the largest health radius for blocker scans\r\n- `AreaBeam` the largest health radius for \"ambient damage\" victim scans\r\n\r\nI decided to keep the fields around so this behavior can be overridden, but made the upgrade rule remove the (old) fields from yaml files, since under normal circumstances there won't be any need to use them.\r\nAlso renamed them to something more fitting, and split them into regular blocking and special-case properties for Bullet and AreaBeam.\r\n\r\nFinally, since only people who either know what they're doing or just want to fool around will ever see the need to use these overrides, I dropped the lint rule entirely since those edge cases should be incredibly rare and don't justify the amount of work and changes necessary to make the lint rule work properly.\r\nThe only sensible reason to set custom values would be to deliberately set lower values to save performance, while deliberately accepting the side-effects, in which case lint warnings (let alone errors) would just be annoying anyway.\r\n\r\nSupersedes
