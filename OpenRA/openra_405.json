One of the players was attacking a small ground force with a Yak. The Yak kills a V2 right before it is shot down by a rocket soldier. However, the plane gets stuck in the game world, is unplayable, and is auto-targeted by any hostile forces that go near it.\n\nAfter running through the replays, the exact cause is as follows:\n\n(1) In the first tick, the Yak destroys the V2\n(2) In the very next tick, the Yak itself is killed. The `FallToEarth` kill observer queues up the `FallToEarth` activity on the `FlyAttack` activity.\n(3) The `Tick` method for `FlyAttack` is called. The target is no longer valid (and in our instance, the Yak was out of ammo), so the `Cancel` method is called on the `FlyAttack` activity. This sets `NextActivity` to null, effectively canceling the crash animation for the plane.\n\nBy simply checking to see if the activity has already been canceled, this can be avoided.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/6","id":2326612,"number":6,"title":"Hide observer hud","user":{"login":"markolson","id":137988,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/137988?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markolson","html_url":"https://github.com/markolson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markolson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markolson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markolson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markolson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markolson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markolson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markolson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markolson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markolson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2011-11-23T05:06:21Z","updated_at":"2014-06-26T17:14:46Z","closed_at":"2011-11-25T05:08:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/6","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/6","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/6.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/6.patch"},"body":"These commits change a few things that have bothered me while playing skirmishes against more than 1 other person, where I'm interested in watching the rest of the game as it unfolds.\n\nI began by adding a choice of what to do upon defeat or surrender: Observe or Leave.
