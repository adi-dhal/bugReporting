in the new playtest (20170923) units are not moving to the closest cells to their destinations. Instead what is happening is when mobs of infantry occupy the cells that those units are trying to reach as their destination all movement orders cancels. This also includes those infantry units on the move to that spot and creates a line of units back behind the group.\r\n\r\nTo re-create this issue have a decent sized army of any unit type. Have vehicles on one key and infantry on another key. Move them to the same cell locations and this will trigger the issue.\r\n\r\nThis also affects RA. In TD its noticable as well but for some reason it seems like attack move is canceling out as well. I haven't been able to reproduce this just yet.\r\n\r\nEDIT: This also seems to have an issue with ore trucks and harvesters temporarily canceling out when that dump area is blocked by another harvester/ore truck.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/14073/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/14072","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/14072/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/14072/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/14072/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/14072","id":260111008,"number":14072,"title":"Fix
