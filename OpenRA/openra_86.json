To have a better overview of the different kind of maps and not clutter the map pool there could be several tabs. Like we have \"Official Maps\", \"Custom Maps\".\n\nI would like to add 3 more categories (better names are welcome!)\n- Official maps: maps that do not fit any catgory but still are good. Like Puddles Redux, Bad Neigbours, Barracuda, Haos Ridges, etc\n- Competitive maps: all maps that qualify for competitive play\n- Worldmaps (or scenic maps): this folder contains maps that look great and/or represent part of the world. These are maps that are not perfectly balanced/chockey, but they are fun to play for not so serious players who like to play a 'story'. Think of maps like: [Great Britain](http://resource.openra.net/maps/14631/), [The Netherlands](http://resource.openra.net/maps/12688/), [Earth 2064](http://resource.openra.net/maps/11928/), [Crimea landgrab](http://resource.openra.net/maps/14663/), and maybe too maps like this one: [Scarborough](http://resource.openra.net/maps/14805/) (not a good map, but pretty and fun for newbies?)\n- Fun maps: all well modded maps or maps that don't fit in the other categories go there. Think of the minigames, God's Divide, best map evurrr, etc.\n- Custom maps: all maps the user has added\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11541/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4914","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"D2A5:572C:15CB90E:2B4C1D0:59D6B37D","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=87>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=405>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=85>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"00cc016249df74a2205718629e48badc\"","status":"200 OK"}}
