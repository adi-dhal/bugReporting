rules cannot just be switched, which would have been the easiest solution.\n\nFixes #7764\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7781","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7781/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7781/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7781/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7781","id":65068842,"number":7781,"title":"UI
