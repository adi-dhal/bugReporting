In order to not have this, you have to pick your starting location every time. \nThe algorithm for starting location is to pick one player's starting location, and then pick the next player's starting location as far away as possible. Unfortunately this means in a 2vs2 team game that you end up as far away as possible from your teammate.\nIt would be nice if the program would automatically guess which sides of the map were supposed to be which, and assume that the starting locations of the teammates are supposed to be close together and that one should not start close to an opponent's starting location, by default.\n\n<bountysource-plugin>\n\n---\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Place a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/244909-don-t-start-next-to-opponent-in-team-games?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3099/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3098","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3098/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3098/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3098/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/3098","id":13322206,"number":3098,"title":"Separate UPnP from Game/Server into it's own class","user":{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2013-04-17T22:06:23Z","updated_at":"2014-07-02T16:39:41Z","closed_at":"2013-04-20T04:21:34Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/3098","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/3098","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/3098.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/3098.patch"},"body":"It was a little scattered around.

want to crush infantry but when I place the cursor over the target infantry, the cursor changes to \"attack\". When I press the Alt key, it does not go to \"force move\" the way that holding Ctrl goes to \"force fire\". I would like to be able to tell my units to force-move on to a tile. This would also be useful if you simply want to maneuver your tank to that location but it's impossible to give move orders because there are too many enemy units changing your cursor to \"attack\". \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3078/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4632","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"9D7F:572B:D8B3CA:1CA2862:59D6BA00","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=369>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=405>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=367>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"c0925f719b16fcff1c1933ee29cef5a1\"","status":"200 OK"}}
