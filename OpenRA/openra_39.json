I explained it more in-depth during the commit:\r\n\r\n- When the Grenadier throws his grenade he enters a state of being \"empty\" for a while (until his ammo is replenished and he can throw again). If he is killed and explodes upon death during this \"empty state\" the Explodes trait will use \"EmptyWeapon\" instead of \"Weapon\".\r\n\r\n- EmptyWeapon has however not been set to anything in infantry.yaml and therefore defaults to \"UnitExplode\" - an explosion that is over 12 times stronger than \"UnitExplodeSmall\" and covers a larger area.\r\n\r\n- What this commit does is make sure the Grenadier's death explosion will always have the same strength. My reasoning is that it was probably never intended for the bang to be so strong in the first place, especially since it happens when the unit has no ammo loaded.\r\n\r\nThis is something I disovered when making the so-called [\"overhaul\"](http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=82&t=19940) and thought it would be perfect as a test commit since it's such a simple fix yet can have a big impact on gameplay.

Why can't I use poison gas?!\" \r\n\r\nOpting to make the campy gag units available as part of the norm in a Red Alert/C&C game is just weird because it'll go against the whole \"too much of a good thing\" motif and the zombies and ants will quickly lose their novelty value (much like the zombie game genre today).\r\n\r\nThat's just my thought on the matter though.\r\n\r\n![tech tech](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25542788/23835962/bd1ac8d8-0746-11e7-8d9f-53edd354d960.png)\r\n\r\nI wouldn't say the Tech Lab placement would need to be fixed in existing maps. Most of the time, people place hazards near them in anticipation of them someday serving a purpose.\r\nIn fact, almost every map that features the Tech Lab has barbed wire and barrels around it or even entire concrete wall perimeters. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6loeCpRBZ4\r\n\r\nThe Renegade X style of adding new tech would be cool. Maybe instead of adding Tiberian Sun tech it could add Tiberian Dawn tech to save on resources by reusing existing ones.\r\n\r\nWhile the one additional unit would be completely random, it could add some interesting tech. \r\n\r\n- If a faction owns an airfield, they could get the Warthogs (the jets used in the airstrikes).\r\n- If a faction owns a helipad, they could get either the Apache or the Orca.\r\n- They could even get the Advanced Comm Center to grant access to Ions but, since it's being used against 1940s buildings, it would be a 1HK against whatever is directly under the crosshair (cursor).\r\n\r\nI don't think the Temple would be necessary though. Maybe Dawn vehicles with slightly more damage than all standard vehicles would be okay.\r\nEx: GDI Medium Tank could do as much damage as a Heavy Tank and slightly higher damage resistance than the RA version. \r\n\r\nI won't go too in-depth since this is all essentially wishful thinking.\r\n\r\nBut, yeah, the possibilities would be endless.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12957","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12957/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12957/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12957/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12957","id":213634179,"number":12957,"title":"Volkov (Soviet Tanya)","user":{"login":"RadicalEdward2","id":25542788,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25542788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RadicalEdward2","html_url":"https://github.com/RadicalEdward2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RadicalEdward2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RadicalEdward2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RadicalEdward2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RadicalEdward2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RadicalEdward2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RadicalEdward2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RadicalEdward2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RadicalEdward2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RadicalEdward2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382420,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Idea/Wishlist","name":"Idea/Wishlist","color":"e102d8","default":false},{"id":21877809,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Red%20Alert","name":"Red Alert","color":"8B0000","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-03-12T20:55:54Z","updated_at":"2017-03-19T23:01:18Z","closed_at":"2017-03-19T23:01:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have proposed this idea on the forum but, decided to pitch the idea here as well with some additional notes I've compiled from both playing OpenRA and reception received on the forum.\r\n\r\nAs a disclaimer, I have never played Mental Omega and only know of the characters from playing the original games on CD. \r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nI noticed that with all the new vehicles and abilities added to Red Alert, there actually are some preexisting assets that somehow haven't made a return yet.\r\n\r\nSure everyone remembers Tanya, the RA Lara Croft-turned-007 via countless re-castings but, what about the Soviet \"Tanya\"? \r\n\r\nI'm not talking about Boris. I'm talking about Volkov and his canine companion, Chitzkoi.\r\nhttp://cnc.wikia.com/wiki/Volkov\r\nhttp://cnc.wikia.com/wiki/Chitzkoi\r\n\r\nFor those of you that don't remember, Volkov, was a Russian cyborg supersoldier armed with a sniper rifle for long range, high powered pistol for close range, and a heavy explosives cannon for air units and naval/ground vehicles.\r\n\r\nHe was an underrated character that was even supposed to return in Red Alert 2 but, was ultimately cut despite still appearing on the cover art.\r\n\r\n![ra2-cover](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25542788/23835470/43919bf2-073e-11e7-8d21-128a7de0fe99.jpg)\r\n\r\nLike Volkov, Chitzkoi was cut from Red Alert 2 as well and only appeared in campaign missions.\r\nHe was cybernetically enhanced like Volkov with his own sets of perks to boot.\r\n\r\nDespite resembling the average attack dog, he was capable of scaling cliffs and could take a few more beatings than a regular Attack Dog. Despite being a cyborg dog, he could still be crushed by vehicles, however, he had a movement speed of 8 as opposed to the Attack Dog movement speed of 4 (the increased speed can be achieved in the current build of OpenRA by having dogs walk on roads).\r\nInterestingly, all Attacks Dogs in the game inherited Chitzkoi's cliff climbing ability.\r\n\r\nTo keep up with the new additions that came with OpenRA, both units could be able to detect cloaked units.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\n- Below are additional notes I compiled after receiving feedback on the forum -\r\n\r\nI have heard some concerns about Volkov being \"overpowered\" but, in the original Red Alert, both factions had access to Tanya but, this did not carry over into OpenRA.\r\n\r\nRight now, the Soviets don't have a Hero unit and the sprite work for Volkov is in the original game's files (or the expansions) so it wouldn't require a complete recreation from the ground up.\r\n\r\nIf we were to really take a moment to look at Volkov, he's just a Mammoth Tank in infantry form which isn't all that OP if you think about it. \r\n\r\nSince the Sniper already exists in-game and may be going to England, why not repurpose Volkov into being a Soviet anti-vehicle and infantry sniper?\r\n\r\nInstead of giving him a high-powered pistol (like RoboCop), give him a PTRD (the Russian anti-armor rifle from WW2). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTRD\r\n\r\nHe could use the PTRD to inflict rocket launcher-like damage to vehicles from a safe distance and 1HK towards infantry (maybe 4 shots against Tanya for balancing). \r\nTo add to the gory nature of classic Red Alert, firing the rifle at infantry could make them explode (as if they were killed with a grenade). Essentially, he would become the equivalent to Havoc in C&C: Renegade (or RenX) multiplayer. He could have the movement speed of a grenadier or rifleman.\r\n\r\nBeing a cyborg, he would keep his explosive canon for warding off aircraft. Also, he can't be crushed by vehicles (because cyborg and that would be a waste of about $1000 and he was also uncrushable in Aftermath). \r\n\r\nLike Tanya, only one of each (Volkov and Chitzkoi) can be present at any given time (unless given via crate) and like the Mammoth, he could regenerate 50% of his health (introduced in Counterstrike except regenerated 100%). \r\n\r\nFor the sake of balancing, Volkov's PTRD could have the same fire rate as a medium tank (giving the illusion of reloading since it's a bolt-action). He also wouldn't be able to C4 buildings; making that a trait exclusive to Tanya (outside of campaign missions). His effective range could be one tile further than artillery or V2 to avoid having a game of \"who will die first\". \r\n\r\nAnother suggestion to add some flare to his character, his death animation could be the electrocution death animation by-default (because cyborg).\r\n\r\nIf you guys don't want to add Chitzkoi, that's up to you. I heard he could attack vehicles in Mental Omega but, that sounds a bit too overpowered. Since he's just a dog, his price could be a fair $800 instead of $200.\r\n\r\nI think that covers everything until I come up with something else to add later.\r\nDo as you please with my proposal. I mean there's ants, zombies, and tech that was never in the original games so Volkov would be a considerably tame addition to the Soviet arsenal.
