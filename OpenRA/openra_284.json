beside them (fixes #2104).\n\nThis will need some careful testing, as a) it potentially affects anything that moves, and b) it has been rebased over a lot of changes, so it may no longer properly fix

It wanted to ensure a BGRA order in memory for the bytes, but everywhere else was respecting the machine endianness. (LockBits and Color respect the machine endianness, and everything else that seems to use those methods just appears to go with it).
