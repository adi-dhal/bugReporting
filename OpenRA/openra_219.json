unit with the CreatesShroud or RevealsShroud trait must update all shrouds when it changes position. Calculating the tiles it can currently see is an expensive calculation that previously had to be repeated for every shroud that needed to know these tiles.\n\nNow, we lazily populate a ref parameter to allow it to be reused for an actor if possible. The biggest improvement comes from the fact that allied players can re-use this calculation when updating their shrouds. Since many games includes a neutral player allied to both sides, most games will see a decent speedup.\n\nOn the RA shellmap, shroud updates dropped from 2.80% of total CPU time to 1.50% (because of the neutral player). Games with large teams will see an even more significant improvement.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7576","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7576/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7576/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7576/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7576","id":59497625,"number":7576,"title":"Just installed OpenRA","user":{"login":"imadsawal","id":7152315,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7152315?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imadsawal","html_url":"https://github.com/imadsawal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imadsawal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imadsawal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imadsawal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imadsawal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imadsawal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imadsawal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imadsawal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imadsawal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imadsawal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382357,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Crash","name":"Crash","color":"e10c02","default":false},{"id":95646850,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Question%20/%20Support","name":"Question / Support","color":"d4c5f9","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-03-02T15:39:48Z","updated_at":"2015-03-02T16:57:40Z","closed_at":"2015-03-02T16:57:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It displays the following error in the exception log : \n\n\"Operating System: Linux (Unix 3.13.0.24)\nRuntime Version: Mono 3.2.8 (Debian 3.2.8+dfsg-4ubuntu1) CLR 4.0.30319.17020\nException of type `System.InvalidOperationException`: No suitable renderers were found.

It should be completed through the span of several PR. If you take a look at the MoveTests, you'll see that I had to mock a load of dependencies in order to make the tests pass successfully. This is a clear smell of Demeter violation. The construction of Move instances should be delegated to some kind of Move factory that can resolve all the move dependencies for him. This, utimately, will make Move easier to undertand.\n- There is no clear barrier and meaning between Mobile and MobileInfo. There are lot of functions that Mobile could deal by himself and yet are delegated to MobileInfo...\n- The crush, block, enterCell, finishmove notifications... are implemented in a way that couples actors to each other. We should think in a way to make this work on a subscribe/publish like the Observer Pattern: http://dotnetcodr.com/2013/08/01/design-patterns-and-practices-in-net-the-observer-pattern/ . A message bus implementation of this would be really smart for the future, and would skyroof the performance.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7564","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7564/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7564/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7564/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7564","id":59340535,"number":7564,"title":"Moved

PR is technically two in one (and I can split it if required) but there is a minor dependency between the commits and they're fairly small so I'm hoping nobody will mind too much :)\n#### Speed up map shroud border\n\nWhen rendering the shroud that only affects the map border (for example, on the RA shellmap, when \"disable shroud\" is chosen during observing or when the \"disable fog and shroud\" cheat is active) we can skip the render entirely if the map border isn't even visible onscreen. This buys a surprising amount of performance as looping over all the visible cells to render nothing is still pretty expensive. On the RA shellmap total CPU time spent rendering the shroud drops from 3.75% to 0.05% (the border is never visible here so we can always bail early).\n\nTo test this, just make sure the shroud continues to display correctly at the map border when using one of the modes described above.\n#### Fix visible cells calculation\n\nViewport.VisibleCells was actually returning a larger region than it needed to. This is a correctness issue, as well as a small perf hit since cells that are offscreen are being rendered.\n\nI reworked the calculation to something that I hope covers the minimal area.\n\nTo test this, make sure that when panning both a rectangular and isometric map that you can always see cells at the edge of the screen.\n\nIf you specifically want to test that the new calculation covers a smaller, more correct area, try the following:\nInsert a line in Viewport.cs at line 181 (or thereabouts) so it looks like this.\n\n``` csharp\ncells = new CellRegion(map.TileShape, tl, br);\ncells = CellRegion.Expand(cells, -1); // Extra line. This will leave a 1 cell gap between the edge of the screen and the render area.\ncellsDirty = false;\n```\n\nIn this PR, you should notice a one cell gap around the edge of the map (try using the \"disabled shroud & fog\" and \"show terrain geometry\" options to help).\n\nOn bleed, you will notice it still renders more than it needs, particularly on the right and bottom of the screen. Try upping the value from -1 to -3 or something like that to see what it is really doing.\n\nThis also applies to isometric maps, except for the bottom of the screen. Due to the tile height it renders downwards a bit more than usual to account for the heights. This is normal (I believe).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7560","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7560/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7560/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7560/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7560","id":59286787,"number":7560,"title":"Speed up frozen actor updates & prevent flicker","user":{"login":"RoosterDragon","id":3399086,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3399086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon","html_url":"https://github.com/RoosterDragon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2015-02-27T20:04:33Z","updated_at":"2015-03-22T21:03:04Z","closed_at":"2015-03-22T13:52:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/7560","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7560","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7560.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7560.patch"},"body":"Fixes  #7660.\n\nPreviously frozen actor updates were done twice per actor.

This is a double edge sword. The Light Tanks can seemingly out perform the medium tanks with numbers of say 10 vs 7. Which I figured the Mediums would win. However if the mediums are evenly numbered or close the mediums win.\n\nThe problem could be that the light tanks perhaps shoot a tad bit to fast? But then this could create issues vs other units (Such as Nod vs Nod or other GDI units.) So im not entirely sure how to make a work around on this. Maybe a slight medium tank HP increase? Turrets turn rate is a bit faster? What do you guys think?\n\n---\n\nAs for the bikes, I think when the fix comes through and are able to implement the build speed modifiers from the price the price rate can stay at 600. But perhaps the bikes range is to far vs tanks? Its got a 2 ranger advantage then the tanks itself. Perhaps knocked to a 1 range different? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4781","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"8726:572A:6FAB91:FB7119:59D6B57D","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=220>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=405>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=218>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"77475a12119e8834d3b1b5f690a6b3ec\"","status":"200 OK"}}
