For the majority of weapons in RA, TD and TS these stages resulted in zero damage or 1 damage point against most actors anyway, while D2k now gets its own, custom Falloffs. This reduces situations where infantry would go prone due to a single damage point, and effectively reduces the default radius that is scanned for victims from 6x to 4x `Spread`, reducing the average number of iterated actors and number of 1-damage-point `Health.InflictDamage` ops.\n- `hitActors` now only enumerates actors with `HealthInfo`, which avoids iterating over and performing a pointless `DoImpact` on invulnerable actors without `Health` trait (which might actually yield significant savings when weapons with large area of effect - like nukes - are fired into an area with lots of rocks or invulnerable trees etc., but for now that's just a guess).\n- reduces default `TargetExtraSearchRadius` to largest feasible health radius on any shipping mod (1c512). A larger scan radius will only be needed when we increase health radii / health boxes, and only on weapons with relatively low area of effect.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9763/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9762","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9762/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9762/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9762/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9762","id":113220406,"number":9762,"title":"Fix TD SAM sites not closing after killing a target.","user":{"login":"obrakmann","id":4331210,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4331210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann","html_url":"https://github.com/obrakmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/16","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestone/16","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/16/labels","id":1214438,"number":16,"title":"release-20151224","description":"","creator":{"login":"reaperrr","id":2857877,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2857877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperrr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":235,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-07-18T22:57:47Z","updated_at":"2015-12-24T15:10:59Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2015-12-24T15:10:59Z"},"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-10-25T11:43:29Z","updated_at":"2015-10-25T16:55:01Z","closed_at":"2015-10-25T14:12:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/9762","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9762","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9762.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9762.patch"},"body":"This will only work when the target was killed, or when you tell the SAM to stop.\n\nThis fix will not make the SAM close if the target is still alive and got out of range.
