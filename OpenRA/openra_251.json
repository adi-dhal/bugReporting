option would act in a way that deny the player to directly attack the enemy base (just the defenses are allowed to attack units, in order to discourage any scout-cheating behavior), with a direct or force attack command, directed on enemy units and structures, until the timer has expired.\n\nThis would force the players to build up a compound, without being suddenly nagged by cocaine-haste enemies, or even just a quick-rushing AI, and instead provide the player enough time to build up all that is needed to fortify his base and things.\n\nThe time should be set while on the Mission selection options screen.\n\nSome alternative versions of this option could include the harvesting of a particular amount of resources, before enable the authorization of attack, or some particular buildings (for example superweapons, like the Nuke Silo structure) or land units (for example Medium/Heavy Thanks or Mobile HQ, in case of particular PvP games). The lasts here, are just some brainstorming of mine, but I would not exclude them from consideration.\n\n<bountysource-plugin>\n\n---\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Place a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/4915538-condition-authorization-to-attack-option?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6595","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6595/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6595/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6595/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6595","id":44194973,"number":6595,"title":"\"Count-Limited On-Field units\" option","user":{"login":"PUOjACKz","id":5386968,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5386968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PUOjACKz","html_url":"https://github.com/PUOjACKz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PUOjACKz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PUOjACKz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PUOjACKz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PUOjACKz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PUOjACKz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PUOjACKz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PUOjACKz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PUOjACKz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PUOjACKz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382407,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"02d7e1","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-09-27T22:40:40Z","updated_at":"2014-12-30T02:59:18Z","closed_at":"2014-12-30T02:58:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have played BFME 2 recently and I have found that the units Count-Limit applied in the game, could be a nice thing, in order to avoid poor unit-rushing strategies, for who is more interested and focused on \"strategy\". Even because sometimes, you have little bases, that produce tons of units. This could be reasonable in particular types of PvP sessions, but not always and especially against the AI. For example, having a number of units potentially buildable, according to the dimension of the base you have built, would encourage the construction of more specific units, instead of just flood the enemy base. This would even try to emulate, some sort of TD game logic, where you didn't have so much resources and you had to think how to attack the enemy base, doing various strikes in order to cripple it, before the final rush.\n\nI think this feature should be optional, and activable according the user preferences (of course).\n\nAccording to the quantity of buildings placed by the player, or particular buildings (for example War Factories, Air Strips, Helipads), the number raise, until a max capped number. Otherwise, it would be nice have even an option to force-cap a number (while on the mission selection area) of maximum units created. This would open some new versions of PvP challenges, where players have to decide what exacly to use and in case, sell their exceeding useless units. \n\nIt can even be conceived as another way of play the game, like deathmatch, capture the flag, king of the hill etc.\n\nI have thought about this feature, even because its insertion in the game, would help people on creating Total Conversion mods, based on the OpenRA engine.\n\n<bountysource-plugin>\n\n---\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Place a bounty on

:\nA mechanic repairs a mammoth tank with low health (3-4 px left) in about 100 s.\nA service depot repairs it in about 40 s.\nMammoth tanks seems to move from one cell to another in about 1,2 s.\nFrom what disance to the service depot the mechanic will be more profitable than a round trip to the service depot ?\nIf my mammoth tank is at a distance of n cells to the service depot :\n2_n_1.2+40>100\nn > 25\nSo if the tank is at more than 25 cells from the service depot, it’s better to repair it with a mechanic.\nMost of the maps have a size smaller than 100x100, so if you build a service depot at coordinates 25,25 (from any corner), mechanics become useless  on 25 % of a significant majority of map.\nIf you build a service depot at coordinates 25,25 from every corner, mechanics become useless on 100 % of these maps.\n\nCost :\nFinally if I want effective mechanics I need to train more mechanics.\nIf 10 bazookas (the cheapest anti tank unit) come to attack my mammoth, I need around... 15 mechanics to maintain this tank alive, even if the tank shoots at the bazookas (tested, I don't know the exact numbers to calculate it accurately).\n15 mechanics = 15*500$ = 7500 $ = 3,75 mammoth tanks.\nIf I had bought 4 mammoth tanks instead of 1 + 15 mechanics, the 4 mammoth tanks would have survived and killed all the bazookas (and I would have saved 1500 $).\nIn game you never have 15 mechanics per mammoth tank, so mechanics become useless again.\nLess than 15 mechanics and the 10 bazookas kill the tank and the mechanics (14 \\* 500 $ + 2000 $ = 9000 $ lost against 10 \\* 300 $ = 3000 $).\n![sans titre](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8930382/4431539/076736c2-466c-11e4-8340-f3107ebb47d6.png)\n\nOn the above screenshot, you can see 7500 $ in the bottom left corner and 3000 $ in the top right corner. The 7500 $ are lost. If it was 4 mammoth tanks instead (1500 $ less and no mechanic), they would have won.\n\nMechanics with faster repair or lower cost ?\n\n<bountysource-plugin>\n\n---\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Place a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/4907024-mechanics-are-too-expensive-or-repair-too-slowly?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6590/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6589","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6589/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6589/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6589/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6589","id":44182341,"number":6589,"title":"A player should have lost only if he has lost everything","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":95766782,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Easy","name":"Easy","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":6382407,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"02d7e1","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"obrakmann","id":4331210,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4331210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann","html_url":"https://github.com/obrakmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"obrakmann","id":4331210,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4331210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann","html_url":"https://github.com/obrakmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2014-09-27T17:30:13Z","updated_at":"2014-12-19T04:20:47Z","closed_at":"2014-12-19T04:20:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"If I have only one power plant left, I can sell it, get a soldier for the sell (my last “object” on the map), find a MCV crate with him, find a 1000$ crate too, rebuild a base, get all the technologies and produce a lot of mammoth tanks.\nLot of mammoth tanks from only one power plant left.\nUnfortunately the game decided I lost when I sold the power plant.\n\n<bountysource-plugin>\n\n---\n\nWant to back this issue?
