Long term this represents a foundation of which additional changes to the Mammoth Tank can be added, given that the current speed **fundamentally cripples** the tank both as an \"utility\" unit as well as a front line army unit.\n\n**Camo. Pillbox:** \n\nHealth: 450HP down from 600HP\n\nThe camo pillbox having cloak and at the same giving the same health/price value as the regular pillbox makes it too beefy and at the same time makes the regular pillbox more or less dormant. This is a very old observation made by a great majority of the community players. The camo. pillbox was super close to being merged in the RA mod as a french exclusive structure #11431. The idea behind it was to further distinguish France as a desceptive faction but also for the regular pillbox to make its way back into the game as a standard defensive structure. As per map playtesting the 450HP c.pillbox accomplished the latter and overall made competetive games a better experience.\n\n**AA Missile Sub:** (**UPDATE**: Removed AAMissileSub commit from the PR.)\n\nCost: $2000, down from $2400\nDamage: 25, down from 30\nAdded air as a valid target\nVisual: Adjusted missile speed and height.\n\nThis is an old one but it's really bad that this hasn't made it's way into the game yet. Hamb first exposed this on his twitch a year ago and pretty much got a round of applause. This balance change more or less drowned in the balance discussions raging on before and after the 20151224 holiday release and pretty much remained dormant as focus went more over the fast evolving land battle meta (and naval maps slipping off the radar). However it was brought back in map playtesting from May and despite having limited exposure due to being a Soviet late tech naval unit it did deliver as prmoised - picking off lazy Hinds and Longbows over or close to water and damaging clusters of idling YAKs with the sudden burst of its submissiles. Plays well and fun as hell. The damage and cost was somewhat reduced to gain the unit a little more accessibility and the missile speed/trajectory altered slightly in order for the AA trajectory to look proper vs air.\n\nCloses
