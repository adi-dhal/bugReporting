There is no longer need for the lookup of the TraitContainer inside the TraitDictionary. For a 15 minute multi player game it results 20 million less function calls and hash table lookups. \r\n\r\nDisadvantage is that when a new World is created the TraitContainers may need to be emptied manually.

Firing the first shot starts the timer tick and will reload even if the clip is not fully reloaded. This also fixes so they don't sit on top of infantry and blow them all away to quickly.\r\n\r\n+ Apache ammo reload amount reduced from 10 to 1.\r\nFixed in unison with ammo reload timer.\r\n\r\n+ Sam now fires two missiles. (CNC95)\r\nDoes extra damage.\r\n\r\n+ Sam range increase from 8c0 to 10c0.\r\nCompensate for the aircraft changes. Also had a problem of MSAMs were always the better choice rather then the structure SAMs itself. This change will make them more viable.\r\n\r\n+ Sam range limit from 9c614 to 12c0.\r\nMakes it so aircraft can still escape while the missile won't detonate at the edge of the circle range.\r\n\r\n+ Humvee damag vs light increased from 50 to 55.\r\nCompensates for the price of the hummer. Having just the HP wasn't enough to counter certian builds of Nod. Enabling them a slightly higher damage allows them to kill buggies and bikes a bit more effectively. Makes them also decent arty and MRLS killers.\r\n\r\n+ Crates got some love.\r\n\r\n+ Viceroids now spawn.\r\n\r\n+ An atomic bomb can now detonate. (CNC95)\r\n\r\n+ Crate veterancy level now gives general rank instead of stripe 1.\r\nThis makes grabbing crates all the more rewarding and riskier. Such as willing to bring a mammoth tank or commando to the crate rather then a minigunner. Instead of a crate granting level 1 for units it will now give rank level 4 promoting to general status.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13555","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13555/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13555/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13555/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13555","id":238619781,"number":13555,"title":"TraitsImplementing calls WithInterface not ActorsWithTrait(?)","user":{"login":"anvilvapre","id":12512948,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/12512948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anvilvapre","html_url":"https://github.com/anvilvapre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anvilvapre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anvilvapre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anvilvapre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anvilvapre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anvilvapre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anvilvapre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anvilvapre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anvilvapre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anvilvapre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382400,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"d7e102","default":false},{"id":95646850,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Question%20/%20Support","name":"Question / Support","color":"d4c5f9","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-06-26T17:51:15Z","updated_at":"2017-06-30T16:17:46Z","closed_at":"2017-06-30T14:46:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\npossible bug in bleed, \r\ndepending on how it was designed to work,\r\n\r\nbackground:\r\n- TraitContainer.Get and GetOrDefault throws an exception when a trait is queried for an actor and that trait does not exist. \r\n- TraiContainer.GetMultiple returns an enumeration, will search the complete container but does not check if it at least finds one entry. So here the same exception is not thrown. \r\n- When I log all traits that are being added to the TraitContainers there is no trait added for the World actor with the name IAutoSelectionSize. tc01, tc02, etc actors seem to have it\r\n\r\nproblem:\r\n- After changing the TraitContainer with a new implementation the game crashes with the error saying that Actor 0 does not have trait of type `OpenRA.Traits.IAutoSelectionSize'. The exception is triggered in GetMultiple - where I also added the check. \r\n\r\ncause:\r\n- The check in GetMultiple in my implemention. \r\n- The original GetMultiple implementation that will result in an empty enumeration. \r\n- World being initialized where DetermineBounds is called. \r\n- World.DetermineBounds calling World.TraitsImplementing\r\n- World.TraitsImplementing call TraitDictionary.WithInterface with this as actor argument.\r\n- TraitDictionary.WithInterface only returning traits for that specific actor. \r\n\r\nsolution:\r\n- Should perhaps World.TraitsImplementing not call ActorsWithTrait instead? Returning all actors with that trait?\r\n- Or, the DetermineBounds incorrectly calls TraitsImplementing \r\n\r\nin summary:\r\n- i think WithInterface is called where ActorsWithTrait is meant? \r\n- WithInterface is also a misleading name? Perhaps better to call it with Trait?\r\n\r\nbug:\r\n- traits being queried that will always result in an empty result \r\n\r\n\r\nor is it dependent on the game mod being loaded whether an actor may or may not implement a certaint trait and therefore it is acceptable to query an actor for a trait it does not
