Otherwise, @pchote  behavior of takeoff after reload/repair is still maintained. This change basically only affects the RA mod and helo interaction with mechanics. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12139","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12139/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12139/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12139/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12139","id":180436550,"number":12139,"title":"Helicopters Can Not Be Commanded to Stay on Pad","user":{"login":"e1d1s1","id":8049221,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/8049221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/e1d1s1","html_url":"https://github.com/e1d1s1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e1d1s1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e1d1s1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e1d1s1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e1d1s1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e1d1s1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e1d1s1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e1d1s1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e1d1s1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e1d1s1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":124120259,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/UI","name":"UI","color":"888888","default":false},{"id":453428319,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Usability","name":"Usability","color":"9dca04","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2016-10-01T04:05:56Z","updated_at":"2016-10-01T19:01:02Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"This is a continuation/improvement upon #12102 that allows mechanics to more easily repair helo units.\n\nIssuing an \"Enter\" command (mouse command to land) for a hind currently results in a \"touch-and-go\" behavior if it is fully armed.
