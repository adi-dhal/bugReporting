the `With*SpriteBody`/`With*Animation` interaction might need a refactor to prevent or at least reduce conflicts between multiple animations, for now making `WithAttackAnimation` upgradable + able to handle multiple sprite bodies should be good enough for most mods.\n\nAdditionally, I split the aiming animation stuff off to its own trait, because these two aspects didn't really work properly together anyway. This also made the code cleaner and more straightforward.\n\nA nice side-effect of the split is that `WithAttackAnimation` now only plays when the specified armament is used for attacking.\n\nLast but not least, due to their current incompatibility with each other, a lint warning and a yaml exception when both are enabled at actor creation have been added to prevent modders from using them at the same time.\n\nUpgrade rules, lint check and yaml exception have all been tested and worked when I tested them.\n\nCloses #11884 (assuming #11886 is merged before this).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12245/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12244","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12244/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12244/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12244/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12244","id":183263121,"number":12244,"title":"Fixed
