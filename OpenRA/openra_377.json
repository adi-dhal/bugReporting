games could become even more interesting if a Ranking system was implemented.\r\n\r\nConcept:\r\n- Players who want their game to be part of the ranking would just have to enable a checkbox during the

a table, on the website\r\n- The ranking could last one month but there could be statistics for 3 months, 6 months, a year...\r\n- Over a season, each player would be able to know his personal statistics such as: \r\n  number of games won, number of games lost, number of games played, pourcentage of \r\n  games won, the fastest game won..\r\n\r\nTo support this new Ranking system, the lobby
