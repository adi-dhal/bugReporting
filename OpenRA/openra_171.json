There are a lot of maps lacking detail or innovation as they are just remakes of existing ones which add more spawns or a bit more surrounding terrain mostly from the same author. They also tend to be very symmetric to ease balancing which makes them look less interesting. We probably need to do a https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/4817 there as well when the time is right.\n\nThis adds some awesome community maps I found and test played with @abcdefg30, @obrakmann, @pchote and @penev92 or against random opponents. They seemed to also work out in terms of gameplay. Some also make use of the new JUNGLE tileset which adds some diversity. They are not too easy to find, because the resource site does not let you filter by mod yet https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA-Resources/issues/23 and there are a lot of RA maps in the repository.\n\nSource:\n- http://resource.openra.net/maps/2702/\n- ~~http://resource.openra.net/maps/1652/~~\n- ~~http://resource.openra.net/maps/2861/~~\n- http://resource.openra.net/maps/1382/\n-

Thanks for the hard work!\n\nThe problems I came across while testing:\n\nAI makes 18 (some are out of screen) harvesters with only 2 refineries, but not a single unit to defend himself: (his base builiding was destroyed earlier)\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6690499/9152840/9b33db74-3e39-11e5-8a7b-90f820f823da.png)\n\nSubs from AI are dropping performance heavily.\nThe game was very slow, so I started to look for the reason (I first suspected the wall across the map, but it wasn't it). Once I killed all units on land except a few buildings, I started at sea, each boat I destroyed the game got back faster and faster. I have a modern fast computer, SSD hard drive, 16GB Ram, etc so on a slower pc the game wouldn't have been playable at all.\n\nTo give an idea: Sub Pen + 6 subs remaining: huge drop in performance, all other units and buildings from that party destroyed. After destroying the sub pen (boats get destroyed with it), performance is back normal. (at the end part of the game, the green player upper right side of the map)\n\nI couldn't wait till the end in the replay to take screenshots at the end, as due to the slow performance it took takes, but see spikes herein performance due to boats:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6690499/9152912/597dd546-3e3d-11e5-8ffa-9e98ef7a904b.png)\n\nReplay:

was: http://resource.openra.net/maps/758/\n\nThanks again for the great update and thanks for looking into

This causes confusion for players who install outdated mods that then crash.\n\nWe can combine this with a mechanism for supporting proper expansion mods to prevent duplication and add support for game expansions like YR to RA2 (as there has been a lot of hostility to the idea of integrating YR into @Phrohdoh's unofficial RA2 mod).\n\nI suggest doing the following:\n- Add a `RequiresMods:` block to mod.yaml.  A hypothetical YR mod that extends a standalone RA2 mod could, for example, declare\n\n``` yaml\nRequiresMods:\n    common: release-20170104\n    ra2: 3.0-beta\n```\n- Add a mod.yaml to the `common` mod dir that supersedes our `all` development mod and stores the \"core\" engine version.\n- Add checks to `ModBrowserLogic` to ensure that the declared mods are available and have their assets installed (depends on #8990).  Display a warning and disable the play button if they are not all available.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8990","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8990/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8990/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8990/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8990","id":99809616,"number":8990,"title":"Move asset installation code and UI into the mod chooser.","user":{"login":"pchote","id":167819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/167819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote","html_url":"https://github.com/pchote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33146668,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Refactor","name":"Refactor","color":"00FFCC","default":false},{"id":124120259,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/UI","name":"UI","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"penev92","id":7137365,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7137365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92","html_url":"https://github.com/penev92","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"penev92","id":7137365,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7137365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92","html_url":"https://github.com/penev92","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/penev92/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-08-08T15:43:10Z","updated_at":"2015-09-26T09:40:06Z","closed_at":"2015-09-26T09:40:04Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"The original plan for our mod chooser has always included asset management, but this second phase has not yet happened.
