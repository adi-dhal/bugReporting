HSL (hue, saturation, lightness) values (_hue_, 255, 255)\n  - _knownColor_ : parsed by `Enum<KownColor>.TryParse` (See System.Drawing.KnownColor)\n- _saturation_ is multiplied by _base_color_ saturation to get the final saturation (colourfulness - 0 is grey)\n- _lightness_ is multiplied by _base_color_ lightness to get the final lightness (brightness - 0 is black)\n- _alpha_ is the opacity/alpha channel\n\nOptions for shortening:\n- Default missing to 255 filling from alpha. Ex: `Blue, 127` is blue with 50% opacity/alpha\n  - This would allow for using rgba semantics like `rgb, 0, 0, 255, 127` to represent blue with 50% opacity/alpha\n- Default empty to 255. Ex: `Blue, , , 127` is blue with 50% opacity/alpha\n  - The number of components is more deterministic\n\nSince there have been remarks about the HSL used by OpenRA being counterintuitive, this might
