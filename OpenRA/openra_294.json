Radar is disabled for the infiltrated player during this time.\n- [ ] Missile Silo/Super Weapon: Nuke/Super Weapon progress reset and paused for X seconds.\n- [ ] Defensive Structure (Turret, Tesla Cannon, Gap Generator, etc...): Infiltrated structure is hijacked, attacking or otherwise working against its owner and allies for a brief period of time. Units in a pillbox are assassinated.\n- [ ] Tech Center: If infiltrating a Soviet tech center you can build the Iron Curtain. Otherwise you disable the enemy's GPS Satellite for X seconds or reset and pause its progress for X seconds if it hasn't yet launched. All units and structures with the Tech Center as a prerequisite are cancelled and can't be built for X seconds. \n- [ ] For infiltrating TC's, I really would mind going down the RA2 route (as much as I dislike so many aspects of the game) and allowing construction of special units from Barracks and War Factory. What units? Erm, new ones. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5298/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4706","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"E3C2:572B:D7B348:1C8115F:59D6B69D","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=295>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=405>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=293>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"5d5a82f4c9977cb9fca056d6253bf66a\"","status":"200 OK"}}
