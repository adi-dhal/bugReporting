First monitor is 1680x1050 and the second is 1920x1080. I use Pseudo-Fullscreen, which results to a 1920x1080 sized window without borders in the second monitor.\n\nEverything works perfectly until I either switch to another virtual desktop and back to OpenRA, or if I minimize OpenRA and then restore it. After this, the mouse refuses to move out of 1680x1050 area, so basically the whole left sidebar is inaccessible and a small 30 pixel area at the bottom too.\n\nSwitching to another application does not cause this.
