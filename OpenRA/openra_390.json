Remove it from all but what is necessary. So take it off every building except: Refinery, Barracks, and War Factory. They serve no purpose and really get in the way on small maps. \n\nA command to \"donate\" a building to an ally. IE: Donate them a Construction Yard after they lose theirs. Shouldn't work for super weapons or side specific buildings. So we cant have allies given an airfield or soviets given a Chronosphere. Donated MCV's should change to whatever team the player they were given to are. Allied MCV donated to Soviet player>MCV is now soviet.\n\nGive medic a special mode (IE: Hitting  Z sets it into MEDIC mode, not on by default.) that will make them run around healing all nearby friendly infantry, return to starting position when no more to heal. On that thought maybe give units a small icon when they aren't set at their default stance? \nShield for defend etc... Or just put a 1,2,3 and we just need to remember what mode each number is. IE: 1=Defend 2=Attack 3=Do Nothing\nSame for mechanic when introduced. \n\n\"Enable Pixel Doubling\" should be removed and either one option chosen for all players, or allow zooming in/out with the scroll wheel. People who don't use it have an advantage over those that do. Personally I don't like being zoomed out that much.\n\nAuto power down select buildings when low power. When low power automatically power down low priority structures. You are likely under attack so you will want base defenses but super weapons will not be necessary. So have it auto power down buildings until base defenses are operational, more important for soviets I guess. Building priority(what to power down first) would be Superweapons>Radar>AA Defenses(check for areas covered by multiple defenses and power down unnecessary ones till equilibrium or continue to next item)>Base defenses(Check for nearby enemy units/area covered by another defense)\nAt that point not much else can be done, the player can manually power on/off stuff as needed. Power should be restored in the opposite manner as new power is created. \n\nSome kind of check to prevent base walking. (IE: 3 buildings in a row with no offshoots shouldn't allow farther construction in that direction.) A cheaper solution would be to not allow cheap buildings to be constructed more then 3 in a row? IE: PowerPlant>Airfield>Helipad>XXXX Cannot build more in that direction. Defensive buildings do not count as offshoots. Could probably easily trick the check so this would need a lot more thought put into it. \n\nAdd check to make attacking units try to stay out of range of base defenses whenever possible.\n\nAdd check for units to decide if the current path is blocked, will going another way take longer? IE: Going over a bridge and the bridge is full but the units on it are moving, will waiting for them to finish crossing or going around be better?\n\nJust throwing out ideas, don't hate me if one is stupid.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2431/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2430","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2430/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2430/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2430/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2430","id":7629391,"number":2430,"title":"(Pseudo)-fullscreen spreads over both screens when using dual-head","user":{"login":"paulvt","id":551904,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/551904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulvt","html_url":"https://github.com/paulvt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulvt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulvt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulvt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulvt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulvt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulvt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulvt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulvt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulvt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33149887,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Polish","name":"Polish","color":"FF9933","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2012-10-16T15:37:11Z","updated_at":"2014-06-23T18:10:51Z","closed_at":"2014-06-23T18:08:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am using a dual-head setup of my laptop and an external 1080p screen.

here is my updated idea now that i have thought for more than 5 minutes :P\n\n I think it would be awesome to add some advanced game options when creating a multiplayer game to modify the game your hosting to meet your needs.\n\nSo there could be an advanced game options panel that allows you to:\nToggle Inf on/off\nToggle Vehicles on/off\nToggle Air\nToggle Crates\nenable crushing of infantry (i really would like this :3)\nchanging of starting funds\ngame speed\nNo super weapons\nno rush\netc\n\nchange game ruleset e.g. have the option to play the C&C mod with the new OpenRA balancing or the Classic C&C balancing\n\nOf course i don't demand in anyway that all these be done but i believe its a great idea and will allow for a bit of flexibility and fun in game
