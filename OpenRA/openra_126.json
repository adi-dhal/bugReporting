The timer in the sidebar would then run backwards when a limit is set, forwards if not. I think this could be interesting for tournaments. When the time runs out before there's a winner, both players lose, resulting in a draw.\n\nAs an idea for a new game mode, I think a 'Destruction` mode where the value of killed units is counted towards a player's score could be interesting. Players would need to think about whether they want to employ expensive powerful units, or weaker but cheaper ones. This game mode would need a score limit, changeable in the lobby.\n\nAnother idea would be an 'Economy' mode where the most harvested ore (or probably oil derricks would work out fairer) contributes to the score.\n\nMaps would then define the game types they support in their `Type` attribute, which would then be an array instead of a single string as it is now.\n\nThere are two problems I don't have a solution for yet with that scheme:\n1. How would the lobby en- or disable the appropriate `*VictoryConditions` trait?\n2. The lobby would need to change according to which game mode is selected for a map (eg. show a time and score limit field). It could also probably explain the rules in a text field somewhere. It currently doesn't know anything about these things at all.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on

:) \nRelated to #9962 (Suggestion: Hide GPS icons when player has low power)\n\nIIRC I think GPS is the only ability which doesn't get restarted after being destroyed and rebuilt, unlike other special

:)\n\nI know this is a more FPS-oriented feature ... but nevertheless I think that radio orders could be very useful in multiplayer games. \nI often lose time and concentration while writing to my teammates ^_^. Also, beacons would become more meaningful. And last but not least, writing blocks any other action (stop, attack move, ...)\n\nFor instance, we could have a key for opening radio-commands, then using numbers keys to issue an order (priority over selecting groups of units).\n\nSo it could be standard orders, or even custom-written orders (in a .yaml file ??? )\n\n(Some possible examples of standard orders : \nTactical orders : \n    Go \n    Follow Me \n        Cover Me \n    Take This Position \n    Hold This Position \n\nTactical reports :\n    Enemy Destroyed\n    Sector Clear\n    I'm in Position\n    I'm flanking\n\nAlert :  \n    Fall Back \n    Need Assistance\n    Report In \n    Enemy Flanking \n    Spy Spotted \n    Tanya Spotted \n    Demo truck Spotted  \n\nRadio Responses :\n    Affirmative\n    Negative)\n##

everyone :) \n\nI just tested out (release 151224) : spies can't infiltrate fake structures (WF, Radar, Navy), so they can easily identify them.\n\nI think ScottNZ talked about it here : https://www.bountysource.com/issues/7983378-add-more-fake-buildings\n\nI think it would make the french faction even more interesting if Fake buildings could be infiltrable, without giving the veterancy (or reveal for Radar) as supposed . \n\nIs this behaviour planned for future releases ? \n\nThank you all ! :)\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on
