an option to make a mission drop a simple savegame that (at least initially) just contains a minimum of useful informations (metadata).\n\nInformation that the file should contain:\n- Short name/ID of the accomplished mission (example: allies01).\n- Which primary and secondary objectives have been accomplished or failed (could be extremely useful for non-linear campaigns, for example if two secondary objectives exclude each other. What mission comes next then depends on which secondary objective you chose to complete).\n\nOptional (but presumably very easy):\n- How much cash did the player have at the end of the mission (TD/RA had a CarryOver feature that could give you a small percentage of the previous missions' end-cash as a bonus at the start of the next mission).\n\nNote: This should also be much easier to implement than in-game savegames and would allow us to finally implement a campaign system.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on

 We've had some lanparties and for the sake of nostalgia, we just look to play some 4vsX computer-stomping (or getting stomped by them) >:)\n\n  Anyway, i think the hardest AI definitely should receive a tune-up, its cool to try to \"crack-a-turtle-shell\" when playing vs AI, defending endless waves of brutal attacks and trying to advance from that hard situation into offensive mode. As some previous posts mentioned, harvesters could be limited (or maybe you're dealing with the pathfinding problem instead) or harvesters could bring in some extra cash for hardest AI to compensate and to keep them sharp all the time, instead of building extremely excessive amounts of harvesters. C&C3 Brutal Steamrollers was the real cool AI to play agains, for example! =) This would probably need one extra difficulty level for current three settings.\n\nThis might not be the highest priority for now, but these tune-up / tweaking issues would be definitely great for ppl like me or some friends of mine, who doesnt really enjoy doing Player vs Player, but just vs AI for fun and talking stuff on voicecomm or lanparty!\n\n Thanks for contributing and making this game, it makes our nostalgia-gaming possible :) I wish i had the skill to contribute and help, but no can do, will have to take the bastard-role of just suggesting stuff!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7209/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7208","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7208/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7208/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7208/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7208","id":52955882,"number":7208,"title":"Editor
