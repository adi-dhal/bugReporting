For example, if I ordered an MNLY to dock at a FIX it should move to the rally point after reloading and repairing. On the other hand, if it was laying mines and it came back to the dock to reload, it should reload and continue to lay the mines.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13720","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13720/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13720/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13720/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13720","id":245234702,"number":13720,"title":"TD: Change the Engineer description to reflect the vehicle capture ability","user":{"login":"VolkovChitzkoi","id":22860815,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/22860815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VolkovChitzkoi","html_url":"https://github.com/VolkovChitzkoi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VolkovChitzkoi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VolkovChitzkoi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VolkovChitzkoi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VolkovChitzkoi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VolkovChitzkoi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VolkovChitzkoi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VolkovChitzkoi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VolkovChitzkoi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VolkovChitzkoi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":95766782,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Easy","name":"Easy","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":33149887,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Polish","name":"Polish","color":"FF9933","default":false},{"id":33453175,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Tiberian%20Dawn","name":"Tiberian Dawn","color":"FFD700","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-07-24T23:00:05Z","updated_at":"2017-07-25T23:59:48Z","closed_at":"2017-07-25T23:59:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"According to the TD rules, the engineer have the ability to capture the tank husks, before they definitively explode (an ability reintroduced on the field mechanic unit in RA).
