How about we do that switch as well? My hope is that it will address issues like https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12494 as we gain more access to memory and maybe it will improve overall performance. Is that too naive? My technical knowledge in that regard is limited.\r\n\r\nPorting should be easy. For the managed code just flip some switches and for the system calls we only need to update the bundled native Windows/Mac dependencies to their 64 bit counterparts and for Linux just update package architecture metadata.\r\n\r\nI haven't checked how many players are still running 32-bit operating systems. Is that possible from our player survey? Hopefully no one will be excluded. My assumption or rather wishful thinking would be that most of them could upgrade to a 64-bit OS for their own benefit and 32-bit only era hardware will also make playing OpenRA especially the upcoming TS/RA2 mods not much fun anyway.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12587/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12586","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12586/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12586/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12586/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12586","id":200906922,"number":12586,"title":"Can't control-group units or buildings from allies ","user":{"login":"Micr0Bit","id":9139965,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/9139965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Micr0Bit","html_url":"https://github.com/Micr0Bit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Micr0Bit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Micr0Bit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Micr0Bit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Micr0Bit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Micr0Bit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Micr0Bit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Micr0Bit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Micr0Bit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Micr0Bit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":117791539,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Regression","name":"Regression","color":"e11d21","default":false},{"id":124120259,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/UI","name":"UI","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-01-15T23:48:40Z","updated_at":"2017-01-17T14:42:27Z","closed_at":"2017-01-17T14:42:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"*current release\r\nmy own troops and buildings work though ... \r\n\r\nthis used to work in the past and was a good feature-addition (mutation?) to help keeping track of allies by using hotkeys to quickly switch to their base or specific units\r\n\r\nnot sure if that is a bug or if it got removed intentionally","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12586/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12585","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12585/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12585/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12585/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12585","id":200884832,"number":12585,"title":"Reordering the list of units/structures in .yaml files","user":{"login":"MustaphaTR","id":7933210,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7933210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR","html_url":"https://github.com/MustaphaTR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustaphaTR/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33146668,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Refactor","name":"Refactor","color":"00FFCC","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-01-15T18:22:44Z","updated_at":"2017-02-27T14:21:19Z","closed_at":"2017-02-27T14:21:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I find it odd that for example RA structures.yaml start with Missile Silo, or vehicle.yaml has V2 etc. I think we those are left at where they was added at first place and never changed.

leave quite a bit of mid-battle performance on the table due to larger-than-necessary victim/blocker scan radii on many warheads and blockable projectiles.\r\n\r\n- All TD and D2k weapons, and at least some RA and TS weapons, don't need to have actor scans on their effect warheads at all, because the warhead triggers on all ImpactTypes anyway.\r\n\r\n- All `SpreadDamage` warheads, and `CreateEffect` warheads that don't trigger on all ImpactTypes, only need to scan up to the largest hit shape (OuterRadius).\r\n\r\n- All blockable projectiles only need a blocker scan radius large enough to find blocking actors, so at least in D2k, TD and RA, they only need something like 768 WDist or less (most outer corner of wall pieces), more than halving the cost of scanning for blockers compared to the default of 1536 WDist. Currently, 50 RA flamethrower infantry firing at the same time cost up to >10ms mostly due to `Blockable: true` on my i5-2500, things are certainly worse on slower CPUs.\r\n\r\nSo to improve performance, following measures can (or rather should) be taken:\r\n\r\n- [x] Automatically use the largest Shape.OuterRadius as victim scan radius for warheads, bouncing bullets and area beams #13236\r\n\r\n- [x] Automatically use the largest Shape.OuterRadius of an actor with `IBlocksProjectilesInfo` as scan radius for blockable projectiles #13236\r\n\r\n- [ ] Skip victim scan entirely on all `CreateEffect` warheads that don't need to scan for actors","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12574/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12573","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12573/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12573/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12573/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12573","id":200547504,"number":12573,"title":"Voice

should support multi-language.\r\nThe core idea of Multi-Language support system is \"localiztion string\" which can be replaced by any other language.\r\nThere are some solutions:\r\nUCS\r\nUCS is a text format which contains \"code\" and \"string\", the code is the unique ID of the string, it can be any pure numbers, such as \"160011\"; The string is the localized string, for example, if we run OpenRA in English, the local string which ID is 160011 is \"SinglePlayer\", but if we run OpenRA in other language such as Chinese, it will be \"单人游戏”.\r\nUCS is quite simple to be processed, each UCS line is splited by \"<TAB>\", we just use split function to split each line of UCS file to get both ID and string.\r\nwe can use this code \"160011\" to stand for string \"SinglePlayer\" in English,  the only  thing translator need to do is translate the code \"160011\" to \"SinglePlayer\" in their language.\r\n\r\nCSV\r\nCSV is famous text format, it is splited by a \"|\", before the \"|\" is ID, after it is string.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12569/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12568","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12568/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12568/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12568/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12568","id":200222669,"number":12568,"title":"Remove

out some of the small things that makes a big difference with the aircraft. Listings below:\r\n\r\nChinook:\r\n\r\nMobile speed increased from 140 to 150.\r\n\r\nThis is increasing because a number of vehicles catch up to these. (Bikes, APCs, buggies, humvees.)\r\n\r\nIncreasing the movement of this unit will help to outrun the APCs and other projectiles a little quicker. It also helps to compensate for travel distances. These units are only used in early game because of the enemies lack of AA. Increasing the speed will help their longevity.\r\n\r\n\r\nApache mobile speed decreased from 186 to 180.\r\n\r\nThis is done to prevent these units from chase killing Orcas as their machinegun fire is on point hits with minimal damage. HP remains the same (Orca 90 Apache 125). Orca being lighter in HP allows it to move more quickly while the apache can soak more damage. In air vs air battles the apache tends to win due to their guns vs slow missile fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth Orca and Apache turnspeed increased from 4 to 7.\r\n\r\nThis is increased on both units because they take a full second before they are able to aim at targets leaving them stationary and taking hits. Increasing this speeds allows them to be what they are ment to be as hit and strike crafts. The turning speed also allows them to hit targets more effectively on the move.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\nI am still testing the damages of the aircraft. Once the poll ends I will start testing more differences on the maps. So far some feedback has been obtained but need more data. Hearing and watching from many releases ago about buffing or nerfing these air units to much can tip the scales as far as being completely broken to completely worthless.
