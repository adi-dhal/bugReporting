think the current explosion system is a little unintuitive and limited.\r\n\r\n1) First of all, it doesn't cover two special cases of the original RA1:\r\n- If a vessel was hit directly (impact close enough to center), the warheads' regular explosion was used instead of a splash anim.\r\n- If an air unit was hit, FLAK.SHP was used instead of the regular explosion anim of that warhead.\r\n\r\n2) I don't like that a 2nd trait is needed on weapons to enable water explosions, and it would only get more complicated if point 1) was implemented the same way.\r\n\r\n3) Furthermore, in my opinion it is a little unintuitive that all explosions are defined as sequences of 'explosion:' instead of as regular animations.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd suggest to take care of all 3 points:\r\nExplosions should no longer be defined as sequences of explosion:, but rather like normal animations, with ground, water, air, ground-target, water-target, air-target sequences.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nWeapon:\r\n(...)\r\n
