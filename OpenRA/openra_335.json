Equals methods make assumptions about the types of objects they are working with, and crash the game if the types are not equal. This behaviour confuses dictionaries (particularly Luainterface's object cache - we need this fixed if we want unbuggy Lua support) which can make use of Equals when doing lookups.\nHere's a sample stack trace of what you could expect when trying to call a method while working with WRanges from Lua. This was pretty awful to debug, with the stack trace talking about something completely different. A simple `!(obj is WVec)` check in WVec.Equals() will fix this particular crash, but I expect there to be a few more crashes like this if it decides to check equality with other things. Edit: yup, there are\n\n```\nException of type `LuaInterface.LuaScriptException`: Specified cast is not valid.\nInner Exception of type `System.InvalidCastException`: Specified cast is not valid.\n
