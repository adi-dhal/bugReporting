usage over 100% (shown in `top`)\n\nstep to reproduce:\n1. start game using mono (`mono OpenRA.Game.exe`)\n2. start a skirmish (then check CPU usage)\n\ncause:\nAfter starting the game (match/skirmish), the [server/listener (TcpListener) would stop](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/bleed/OpenRA.Game/Server/Server.cs#L656), the stopped TcpListener somehow cause the [Socket.Select](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/bleed/OpenRA.Game/Server/Server.cs#L163) not to block and thus resulting a busy loop (High CPU usage)\n\npossible solution:\n1. use `Thread.Sleep` in the loop\n2. exclude `listener.Server` from the checkRead after the game started,  note: there MUST be some kind of check to prevent `System.ArgumentNullException: All the lists are null or empty.` (and maybe also a Thread.Sleep)\n\nsystem:\nfedora 21 (linux)\nmono 2.10.8 (on 29/12/2014) and mono 3.10.0 (from 30/12/2014)\nopengl 2.1\n\nthe different version of mono is cause pchote suggested that it could be the reason to the high cpu load so i updated it on 30/12/2014\n\ni also notice it long ago when i was using fedora 19 (i don't remember the mono version) but back then, i just thought it was cause my laptop wasn't powerful enough.\n\nnotes:\ni am able to reproduce the busy loop using this code: http://asl97.pythonanywhere.com/paste/cpp/7a9d9bd1-d5c0-43bc-a49e-13fc86d12b01\n\nthis
