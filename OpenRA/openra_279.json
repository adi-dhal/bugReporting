I think it would be interesting to add to Openra some kind of building/support power that could provide a shield to buildings or vehicles.\nI have some ideas for them:\n\n1 - Building that generates a shield that blocks projectiles:\n-This shields has a limited strength and when is hit beyond the limit it would destroy the building OR disable it for some time then it would regenerate over time;\n-It could be shutdown by unsufficient power;\n-This shield would block projectiles that pass the \"Bubble\" (I mean it's range);\n-It could or not block SuperWeapons. (Ion Cannon and Nuclear Strike)\nEXAMPLE: Supreme Commander's Shield Generators\nhttp://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20070501234236/supcom/images/thumb/1/1d/Cybran_shield_insitu.jpg/400px-Cybran_shield_insitu.jpg\n\n2 - Building that gives an \"aura\":\n-Everything inside the range would receive additional strength (Not healing, shield itself);\n-The shield would regenerate itself overtime with a certain speed;\n-Allies can/can't benefit from it;\n-It can be shutdown by unsufficient power;\n-Multiple buildings won't stack;\n-The shield building could or not benefit from it;\n-The units will only recieve it when inside the range, leaving it will lose it.\n-It could be only personal (only the actor itself);\nEXAMPLE: Path of Exile's Discipline Aura\nhttp://i1.ytimg.com/vi/op3-qOyjvp0/maxresdefault.jpg\n\n3 - Building with a SupportPower (Shield):\n-Choose only one unit to recieve it.\nOR\n-Target an area and everything inside it would receive the shield;\n-It could be temporary or permanent (it can be destroyed) (it would be better to be permanent in RA since there is the IRON CURTAIN)\n-Talking about the Iron Curtain, units affected by invulnerability can still lose their shield by taking damage;\n-Adds some extra health to the actors, the shield will absorb all damage;\nEXAMPLE: Can't find a decent one to demonstrate this.\n\nNote: The shield I'm talking about has limited health and theoretically the IRON CURTAIN gives a \"temporary shield that has unlimited heath\".\n\nThis would be delicious to modders. (I think it would ^.^)\nIt can be a very interesting feature\nPerhaps you can add it in the future. :+1: \n\n<bountysource-plugin>\n\n---\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Place a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/2885969-shields-should-be-interesting-not-the-iron-curtain-power?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5777/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5776","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5776/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5776/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5776/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5776","id":36760134,"number":5776,"title":"Shield","user":{"login":"GiftSender","id":2829629,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2829629?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiftSender","html_url":"https://github.com/GiftSender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiftSender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiftSender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiftSender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiftSender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiftSender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiftSender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiftSender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiftSender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiftSender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-06-29T23:07:43Z","updated_at":"2014-06-30T02:31:16Z","closed_at":"2014-06-30T01:55:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5775","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5775/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5775/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5775/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5775","id":36748920,"number":5775,"title":"Add an option to mute spectators","user":{"login":"deniz1a","id":6599106,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6599106?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a","html_url":"https://github.com/deniz1a","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382407,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"02d7e1","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-06-29T16:06:32Z","updated_at":"2015-02-24T19:43:58Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Some people complain about it.
