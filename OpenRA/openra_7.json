Luckily the first frame includes a reference piece from terrain artwork. I took a screenshot, moved it and counted the pixels. It then turned out that the OpenRA `sequence.yaml` offset currently matches `art.ini` in that\r\n* `TileXOffset=` is the same as our `X`\r\n* `TileYOffset=` minus 24 is our `Y`\r\n\r\nI don't know if that applies generally.\r\n\r\nI added them to maps where I could spot waterfalls with both snow and temperate test cases included.

While this PR may look ad-hoc, I think this could be the proper fix.\r\n\r\n* GI deploys and the Mobile trait becomes disabled.\r\n* Because mobile is disabled, Turn activity won't work (intended for EMP'ed units) and the unit can't change its facing to attack the enemy.\r\n* One option is to use turreted attack AND attack frontal so that while in deploy mode, it will use its \"turret\" to attack.\r\n* However, even if we get this multiple AttackBase approach to work, it still doesn't look good since:\r\n  * The infantry returns its facing to its \"neutral\" facing on idle (because, turret.)\r\n  * If we disable that by RealignDelay = -1 in TurretedInfo, it still looks bad. When we undeploy the GI and deploy it somewhere else, the turret will not face where the unit was facing just before it deploys and instead, the turret alignment just before relocating the GI will be in effect.\r\n* So I think the option of allowing the unit to turn even when it is immobile is a good solution.\r\n\r\nYAML for GI looks like
