The code itself changes the owner of the captured building to `self.World.WorldActor.Owner` during the 10-second cooldown. However, the world owner in a number of maps is set to be hostile to all multiplayers; either the \"Creeps\" player is set to be the world owner, or the \"Neutral\" player has the multiplayers set to be enemies (no-fly-zone.oramap, for example). \n\nWhen a building is put into the 10-second cooldown on one of these maps, the buildings become hostile to all players, causing the building to be a candidate for auto-target inside of one's base. This really causes a problem on maps that have capturable neutral buildings, such as oil derricks, as the oil derrick is a desired resource that ends up getting attacked the moment the capture cooldown starts.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2013/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2012","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2012/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2012/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2012/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2012","id":4018703,"number":2012,"title":"20120315 - Unable to Join Games, but can host....?","user":{"login":"earthpig","id":1620838,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1620838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/earthpig","html_url":"https://github.com/earthpig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/earthpig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/earthpig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/earthpig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/earthpig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/earthpig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/earthpig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/earthpig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/earthpig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/earthpig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":95646850,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Question%20/%20Support","name":"Question / Support","color":"d4c5f9","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2012-04-08T00:30:16Z","updated_at":"2014-04-28T07:15:06Z","closed_at":"2012-04-10T09:38:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think... once, I've been able to join a game.\n\nEvery other time, it stays at \"attempting to connect...\" indefinitely. \n\nLinux version (Ubuntu), no networking issues that I'm aware of (eg, no problems in other games and so on, no crazy network settings on my computer or router).\n\nThe odd thing is, I can host just fine.\n\nEDIT: I had someone else create a game, and now it works beautifully.

This, in practice, greatly changes how V2s, Artillery, Cruisers and other long-range weapons work, as the targets a player wishes to attack will have to be scouted with units like Jeeps.\n\nFor debugging purposes, it adds a new hotkey during replays: \"v\" will cycle between players' views. Multiple games have been played with this patch with no sync errors or crashes while watching replays and cycling through views. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9","id":2498266,"number":9,"title":"Quicker unit production with multiple producers.","user":{"login":"markolson","id":137988,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/137988?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markolson","html_url":"https://github.com/markolson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markolson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markolson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markolson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markolson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markolson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markolson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markolson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markolson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markolson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":26,"created_at":"2011-12-09T03:33:36Z","updated_at":"2014-06-14T11:24:41Z","closed_at":"2013-01-24T15:17:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/9","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9.patch"},"body":"I am sure that the ActorsWithTrait call is wrong, but I couldn't dig up another way to do this.
