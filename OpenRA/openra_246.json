to #5712 - releases more sheet buffers allowing 96 MiB of memory to be freed.\n\nSome background for anybody unfamiliar: prior to #5712, the Sheet class would permanently hold a reference to a managed copy of the texture it was representing. This is for performance as making small incremental updates was faster than getting and setting texture data from the texture itself all the time. Instead the changes were batched up in the managed buffer and committed on demand to the texture.\n#5712 introduced a method to allow this buffer to be marked for release once committed to the texture. If no more incremental updates are planned this allows the buffer memory to be reclaimed. This is important because these buffers can be very large.\n\nEven after #5712 there were still some sheets with buffers that stuck around, allocated by:\nMapCache (16m)\nSpriteFont (16m)\nVoxelLoader (16m)\nSequenceCache \\* 4 (16m) (one per tileset)\n\nThis PR address 6 of those 7 sheets, freeing an additional 96 MiB.\n\nThe data buffer is now generated lazily, which solves the problem for VoxelLoader.\nThe 4 SequenceCache sheets are released as part of preloading the sequences - when preloading everything we know we won't be needing the buffer again later.\nThe MapCache sheet is now released when the map generation thread dies. In this particular case the texture may not get rendered for a while, so we make a manual call to force the buffer to be written to the texture after which it can be freed.\n\nThis only leaves a buffer for the SpriteFont sheet. When text is drawn the glyphs are lazily generated and so we can't easily get rid of the buffer without impacting either performance or flexibility.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6756/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6755","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6755/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6755/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6755/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6755","id":45772750,"number":6755,"title":"\"u2\"

are a few things that have been bugging me for a while, with regard to how the mod folders are organized. In my opinion,\n1. weapons.yaml should be either\n   - moved into the rules folder, or\n   - moved into its own weapons folder, and then split into roughly categorized yamls (e.g. machineguns, ballistics, missiles, heat [fire and lasers], other) to make navigation easier (I already do that for both projects I'm working on).\n     To have it in the mods' main folder is rather unintuitive.\n2. Yamls related to defining music, movies, notifications, voices and maybe missions as well should be moved into a subfolder. I can't come up with a one-word folder name that makes this purpose clear enough though, `contentdefinitions` is a bit long...\n3. To have a `chrome.yaml` which defines ui element graphics and sizes, a `metrics.yaml` which sets some UI defaults and a `chrome` subfolder with lots of widget yamls is highly confusing to any new modder not familiar with OpenRA. For starters, `chrome` itself is a relatively non-descriptive term. My suggestion would be to rename the `chrome` folder to `uiwidgets` or just  `ui`, rename `chrome.yaml` to `uielements.yaml`, and `metrics.yaml` to `uimetrics.yaml`. Then people would understand right away what contains what.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on
