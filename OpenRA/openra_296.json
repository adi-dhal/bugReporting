How do you feel about the idea of extracting the shadow bits from a sprite into a separate sprite and deleting them from the original sprite? Thus rendering units from two sprites?\n\nOr adding a way to render sprites without shadows and only shadows without the other content?\n\nI've tried to figure out a way to do it using palette manipulation, as suggested by @chrisforbes in #3335, but reading the sprite rendering code proved to be too difficult for me. Maybe if you guys could tell me where and how exactly the magic happens with palette application to the rendered

for all its greatness, doesn't do very well at one of the things it's supposed to do well, namely take out light vehicles quickly (humvee, artillery, MLRS, etc.). Apache is required for Nod as a reliable way to take out MLRS, but currently it doesn't do enough damage to take it out with its entire payload (which takes 4 seconds to unload, to boot). A single Apache should be able to destroy an MLRS, if it gets the chance.\n\nIf anyone thinks the Apache needs nerfing, I would suggest looking in other areas besides its damage vs. light armor. \n\nAlso, does anyone object to removing the AG/AA distinctions for helicopters? They don't seem needed anymore.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5253","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5253/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5253/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5253/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5253","id":32769774,"number":5253,"title":"Console","user":{"login":"Unit158","id":706008,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/706008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158","html_url":"https://github.com/Unit158","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unit158/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":16,"created_at":"2014-05-04T14:51:44Z","updated_at":"2014-06-12T18:01:20Z","closed_at":"2014-05-13T07:09:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/5253","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5253","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5253.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5253.patch"},"body":"Implements

seeing Mailaender's latest comment (about the ingame map editor): https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3377#issuecomment-42101971 that made me think : \"we should really be able to move all these actors\".\n\nThat's why I hope that you'll consider adding a toolbar with a few buttons ; and one of them could let the player move actors.\n\n![2cbcb9f4-d2b0-11e3-88ab-9fc0b8d73092](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1732773/2870342/68354960-d2bf-11e3-940a-b28b676b32dd.png)\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this
