Damage vs Heavy Armor: +12.5%\n- Damage vs Light Armor +20%\n- Rate of fire halved, damage doubled\n\nTaking advantage from the past months' map playtesting I'd like to propose these Light Tank changes for the next playtest.\n\nFollowing the previous release buff of +1 vision range the Allies has gotten a somewhat useful early-game frontliner providing line-of-sight and a bit of damage soak for the infantry. The Light Tank still has a short expiration date due to its low health and abysmal damage output, as it gets dwarfed as soon as players build up their rocket squads while teching up to either Service Depot or Radar Dome.\n\nThe change in damage output was specifically aimed towards allowing Light Tanks to do better job at fighting and zoning out light vehicles and flanking undefended artillery/V2's as well as undeployed MCV's (as with the Mobile Flak). Experience demonstrated that not only was this accomplished to a certain degree but also avoided certain pitfalls such as swarm killing Ore Harvesters due to +12.5% Heavy Armor damage. The Light Tank is still phased out during games but a bit slower and does widens Allies' tech choice a little bit by using Light Tanks as support while teching up to Radar Dome before the Service Depot.\n\nThe rate of fire change is something I've always loved to see changed regardless, making the tank feel less like a pea shooter. I understand this was due to better target faster units such as Rangers, Mobile Flaks and APCs but the gain is pretty negligable. Even more so with the proposed damage buffs.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11926","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11926/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11926/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11926/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11926","id":174101960,"number":11926,"title":"Added

cause for this issue was indeed a regression from #11721.\n\nIt turns out that there may be situations\\* where the else-branch (the \"there already is a smudge here\"-case) in `AddSmudge` is taken even though there isn't a smudge (when the location in question is contained in both the `dirty` and `tiles` arrays, but `RemoveSmudges` ran previously for the same location).\n\nIn that case, the `Tile` field is null, but gets referenced in that else-branch, producing the NRE.\n\nThere are two possible ways to fix this. The first is to set the `Tile` field to a random entry in `RemoveSmudges`, the better way is to check the smudge for the \"deleted\" marker, which is a `Sprite` field set to `null`.\n\nFixes #11922.\n\n*Didn't delve too deeply into it, but in my replay a building was sold while oil barrels around it were being blown up, so I assume it's some kind of race condition where `RemoveSmudge` and `AddSmudge` run during the same tick for the same location.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11924/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11923","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11923/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11923/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11923/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11923","id":174050407,"number":11923,"title":"Doubled

On these maps Wall HP was additionally nerfed to 300HP from 500HP with buffs specifically vs tesla weapons. I adopted the _damage vs_ tweaks for my own round of balance maps, including the latest batch of maps v1.3 still available on the resource site http://resource.openra.net/maps/uploader/78/page/3/ with some 800 downloads from late July.\n\nThe pull request is a conservative take from the feedback and experiences drawn from the playtests.\n\n In short, the Flame Thrower and Tower does an unreasonable amount of damage compared to their peers. We've given a pass on the Grenadier because it functions as a disposable utility unit that doesn't add to any army composition in the game. \n\nBuffing Rocket Soldier damage vs Walls by a factor of 2,5 isn't overall a gamechanger given the default damaga value but will help Allies gain access to walled off areas early game (compared to Grenadiers) and give armies of _both_ factions (Soviet having early access to Flamethrowers) an equal chance at breaching against Wall spamming with Rocket Soldiers as part of any standard army composition.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11910/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11909","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11909/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11909/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11909/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11909","id":173617901,"number":11909,"title":"Use
