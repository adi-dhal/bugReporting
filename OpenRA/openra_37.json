is a suggested change to the CnC/TD official map pool, arrived at in consultation with many of the regular TD players. This pull request is in response to the request made by pchote here: http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=82&t=20031, which has discussion and a poll on the issue. I had raised an issue (https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13016) but thought it would be more helpful to make the changes myself.\r\n\r\nBelow is a list of maps I suggest to add/modify/leave unchanged/remove, comparing with the maps in the playtest-20170304. In the case of maps to be added or modified, I have used 'my' filenames. In the case of maps to be removed, I have used the playtest-20170304 filenames. I have given brief reasons for each modification.\r\n\r\nI changed the 'Categories' from '%' to 'Conquest' for the affected maps (all by Norman). I cleaned up the titles of some maps, but I left the map filenames and the map authors intact. As such, the UIDs for ~19 maps will now differ from the list below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Add**\r\n\r\n1. 169.oramap da8e7c4d4c4ca62812af156769ee9544f403bdd0 http://resource.openra.net/maps/16886/\r\n2. arcade.oramap aeeb0337abf307755a862ee3e321e804e623fdc4 http://resource.openra.net/maps/16895/\r\n3.

actor commands that is expected to continue are interrupted and the activity assumed complete when the interruption is resolved. This results in significantly different behaviour from their counterparts on the original games.\r\n\r\nHunt() - Breaks after killing one enemy (Expected: continue Hunt)\r\nAttackMove() - Breaks after killing one enemy (Expected: continue AttackMove until waypoint is reached)\r\nGuard() - Breaks after killing one enemy (Expected: continue Guard)\r\n\r\nBy 'break', I mean the action is deemed complete and the actors moves on to the next activity.\r\n\r\nPatrol() and PatrolUntil() are also affected since they are based on a AttackMove()-Wait() loop. Actors will go to the next waypoint, skipping his/her current waypoint if an enemy is intercepted.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\n**To reproduce:**\r\n\r\nGive an actor a _single_ command using an Lua script. Then throw an enemy in its path.\r\n\r\nHunt():\r\n Actor will hunt for one actor and attack it. Then it will become Idle.\r\n\r\nAttackMove():\r\n Actor will move towards the target location and attack the first enemy it sees. Then it will become Idle.\r\n\r\nGuard():\r\n Actor will move towards the target actor and attack the first enemy it sees. Then it will become Idle.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis forces scripters to create their own custom scripts to ensure such activity 'resumes'. This is seen in current campaigns and Lua customised maps across all mods. \r\n\r\n**Case example:**\r\nIf you have noticed, almost every mission in the RA mod defines their own IdleHunt and PatrolLoop Lua functions. As they heavily rely on OnIdle script triggers, I expect aircrafts to handle this badly. #13015\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nThere exists the possibly of scripters viewing the interruptions as features.\r\n\r\nAs a solution exists by re-creating the logic on Lua, I would like some word from the devs if the current implementation should be the maintained.\r\n\r\nEdit: Engrish.\r\nEdit 2: Clarity.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13017","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13017/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13017/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13017/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13017","id":216635628,"number":13017,"title":"Aircrafts has \"Attack\" property, but does not respond when it attempts to execute Attack(target)","user":{"login":"lovalmidas","id":13613471,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13613471?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovalmidas","html_url":"https://github.com/lovalmidas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovalmidas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovalmidas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovalmidas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovalmidas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovalmidas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovalmidas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovalmidas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovalmidas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovalmidas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":76857560,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Scripting","name":"Scripting","color":"006b75","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-03-24T03:35:21Z","updated_at":"2017-04-02T19:46:14Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Aircrafts (as defined without custom rules) have unusual handling of certain Actor commands exposed by the API.
