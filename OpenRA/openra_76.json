boxes from order generators render above the shroud like they do everywhere else (I don't think we have a ticket for this issue).\n- Works towards #7520.\n- Removes duplication/hacks from the health

was thinking that, while playing RA with Alliance, the player often send a spy inside a building, or to shutdown the power grid, getting veteran units etc. (even if I still don't have understand what happend, when you send a spy inside a radar dome). If you try to send someone on the deployed MCV, you can't access it. After the player have sent a spy inside the enemy building, he doesn't need to use the unit more again (at least, for OpenRA, where you can use it for tactical kills). My idea was instead to keep the interest on player, on infiltrating enemy bases, adding a scalar system. For example, if you send a spy on enemy barracks, the first time, you get veteran units. If you send him again, you get the possibility to build one new enemy unit, that usually could be obtained only constructing the enemy barrack, after taken over the enemy MCV.\n\nIn short, spy infiltration (I throw just some ideas about how it could be):\n\nEnemy barracks: (1) Get veteran units, (2) Get Granade launcher soldier, (3) Get Flamethrower soldier, (4) Get Hijacker, (5) Get Shock Trooper, (6) Get Attack Dog ....\nEnemy warfactory: (1) Get veteran units, (2) Get APC unit (for example), (3) Get V2 Rockets... or even (4) Get Chrono Tank, (5) Get Demotruck ...\nEnemy MCV: (1) Get Flame Tower, (2) Get Airplane strip, (3) Get Subpen, (4) Get French fake structures ...\nEnemy Research Center: (1, Among with Radar Dome infiltrated) Get Spy plane, (2, Among with Radar Dome infiltrated) Get  Paratrooper, (3, Among with Radar Dome infiltrated), Get Parabombs, Get Counterstrike B-52 Air-Fuel bomber\nEnemy Airstrip: (1) Get vetera units, (2) (After you infiltrated a research center and obtained an enemy airstrip for infiltration) Counterstrike Nuclear Mig\n\nSo you can even, using this kind of concept, introduce the hidden/secret counterstrike/aftermath units, like nuclear mig, fuel-air bomber, volkov, chitzkoi, even \"strange\" units from Paradox equation mission or various tipes of Giant

displayed there is template 80 (both on last release and on bleed). However, compared to last release, the templates 79 and 80 appear to have been swapped. Somehow `falls1.des` and `falls2.des` must have been mixed up when the desert tileset was added to RA.\n\nIn TD, `falls1.des` is 3x3 cells and `falls2.des` is 3x2 cells as well, so that fits, [see here](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/bleed/mods/cnc/tilesets/desert.yaml#L1567-L1593).\n\nThe first commit fixes this, and restores the situation from last release.\n\nThis is what it used to look like:\n![screenshot from 2016-08-20 12 43 42](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4331210/17830767/d6ca16ce-66d5-11e6-9975-4f99ab58a7c5.png)\n\nNotice however that that's actually a tiling error, the template is cut off on the right side (the bush on the lower bank is cut in half). The left part is template 80, the cave thing itself is template 76.\n\nI corrected the tiling error like this:\n![screenshot from 2016-08-20 13 02 23](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4331210/17830783/6f277bc8-66d6-11e6-9930-8337f8648964.png)\n\nFixes #11829.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11842/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11841","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11841/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11841/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11841/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11841","id":172266195,"number":11841,"title":"Added the Nod Cyborg Reaper","user":{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118248490,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Has%20dependencies","name":"PR: Has dependencies","color":"fbca04","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2016-08-20T11:10:22Z","updated_at":"2016-12-18T06:59:59Z","closed_at":"2016-12-15T23:57:47Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/11841","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11841","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11841.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11841.patch"},"body":"Depends on https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11787 and https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11624 as well as something that fixes \n\n```\n Actor has multiple traits of type `OpenRA.Mods.Common.Traits.Render.RenderSprites\n```\n\nfor webguy to work.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11841/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4924","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"D1AB:572D:13EB2B4:305E321:59D6B354","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=77>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=405>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=75>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"9a0b3dff0a2b14a73a471b4d590c1524\"","status":"200 OK"}}
