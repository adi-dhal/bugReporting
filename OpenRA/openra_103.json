The projection matrix is expanded to transform the raw z coordinates into normalized device coordinates... this was tricky to solve and is the most likely place to find bugs because any vertex mapped outside the range -1...1 it will be discarded, leaving a hole in the map.  Finally, the depth preview is adjusted to combine the vertex depth with the depth sprite to produce the final depth image that is drawn into the color buffer.  It will eventually be written into the depth buffer, but we don't need that yet so it's not included here.\n\nThe feature must be explicitly enabled by defining `EnableDepthBuffer` on the MapGrid so it shouldn't affect the classic mods (but this should be tested) or ts once the test commit is dropped.  Because actors etc don't write sensible vertex z coordinates they end up being discarded for most map scroll positions (reason explained above).  My [depthbuffer-part-two](https://github.com/pchote/OpenRA/tree/depthbuffer-part-two) branch prototypes that support, which shows off the almost-proper depth sorting that this pr is working towards.\n\nThings to look out for / be aware of when testing:\n- If the projection is wrong then holes will appear in the map, probably at the top or bottom of the screen or where the terrain is very high.\n- The depth image should look consistent with the map everywhere (no sudden jumps in shade that aren't explained by the map tiles).\n- I've included the test map that I uses for tweaking and debugging the depth transformations.\n- Loading the \"Town of Karasjok\" map into the editor is a good way of getting a feeling for this.  You can enable depth rendering in the editor by starting a skirmish, enabling depth rendering, returning to the shellmap, then starting the editor.\n\nGood luck!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11058/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11057","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11057/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11057/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11057/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11057","id":146134964,"number":11057,"title":"[AI] [TD] Enable Repair Pad build for AI --> needed for MCV replacement","user":{"login":"jaZzKCS","id":2698113,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2698113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaZzKCS","html_url":"https://github.com/jaZzKCS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaZzKCS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaZzKCS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaZzKCS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaZzKCS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaZzKCS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaZzKCS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaZzKCS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaZzKCS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaZzKCS/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":124732140,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/AI","name":"AI","color":"486b79","default":false},{"id":33453175,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Tiberian%20Dawn","name":"Tiberian Dawn","color":"FFD700","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/17","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestone/17","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/17/labels","id":1372708,"number":17,"title":"release-20160508","description":"","creator":{"login":"atlimit8","id":4957137,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4957137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8","html_url":"https://github.com/atlimit8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":154,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-10-23T15:44:13Z","updated_at":"2016-12-24T14:29:58Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2016-05-09T19:42:46Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-04-05T23:14:55Z","updated_at":"2016-04-06T17:42:42Z","closed_at":"2016-04-06T17:42:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Currently, the AI in TD does not build repair pads (set to 0 in yaml).
