We have avoided committing any of these changes as part of other prs that introduced map rule changes, as per our policy for avoiding unrelated changes in prs.\n\nThis has lead to two issues:\n- There is a lot of noise to sort through and discard when running the rule updater.\n- The maps on the resource site were recently updated (including these formatting changes), which has left them out of sync with what we ship.  This will be the reason for http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=82&t=16784 and the many missing maps on http://www.openra.net/games/.\n\nThis pr includes the result of opening and resaving all of our shipped maps.  It also includes a fix for mission maps (which otherwise lose their PreviewVideo key), and trailing newlines in some of the mod rules.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6783/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6782","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6782/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6782/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6782/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/6782","id":46185033,"number":6782,"title":"Fixed

Wouldn't it be nice to start supporting unit tests to take that burden off developers' shoulders? Could also automate running the tests when pull requests are submitted.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UmmaPe8Bzc\nUnit Testing: Minutes Now Will Save Hours Later - Eric Mann\n\nIt's probably best to go with the popular NUnit 2.6.3, which is a super easy to use and very extendable cross platform testing framework for .NET and the source is actually hosted here on github, although the website has more information http://www.nunit.org/\n\nTo implement NUnit in a project you need a .nunit config file and an assembly that the test fixtures can be executed from. Here's an example of a vanilla NUnit fixture:\n\n```\nusing NUnit.Framework;\n\nnamespace SomethingNamespace\n{\n    [TestFixture]\n    class Test\n    {\n        Something something;\n\n        [SetUp]\n        public void SetUp()\n        {\n            something = new Something();\n        }\n\n        [Test]\n        public void Hello()\n        {\n            Assert.That(something.Hello(), Is.EqualTo(\"Hello!\"));\n        }\n\n        [Test]\n        public void MakeList()\n        {\n            something.MakeList();\n            Assert.That(something.list, Is.InstanceOf<List<int>>());\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIt's that simple. Then you can run the testing program on the assembly and it returns the output of the selected tests.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6777/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6776","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6776/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6776/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6776/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/6776","id":46156796,"number":6776,"title":"Improve new-lua error handling.","user":{"login":"pchote","id":167819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/167819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote","html_url":"https://github.com/pchote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/11","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestone/11","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/11/labels","id":714748,"number":11,"title":"release-20141029","description":"","creator":{"login":"chrisforbes","id":128877,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/128877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisforbes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":159,"state":"closed","created_at":"2014-07-09T04:28:35Z","updated_at":"2015-12-24T15:15:27Z","due_on":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2014-10-29T09:03:35Z"},"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-10-18T00:18:48Z","updated_at":"2014-10-18T22:08:44Z","closed_at":"2014-10-18T10:24:32Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/6776","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/6776","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/6776.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/6776.patch"},"body":"This improves our handling of lua errors by\n1. not crashing inside most of our recent triggers\n2. writing the error details (and also print statements) to lua.log\n3. halting the game on error with a (rudimentary) dialog.\n\nThe error dialog UI isn't great, but this will be difficult to improve without completely rewriting our info-panel implementation.
