The global chat history or nickname panel has a chance to pass in `null` for `Game.GlobalChat.History` or `Game.GlobalChat.Users` during binding. What this will do is set `collection = null`, and `BindingRefresh()` would get caught with an NRE. What's interesting to me is it seemed like:\n- Event bindings on `collection` are being cleared.\n- `Collection` is being set null.\n- For some reason, the event `BindingRefresh` still gets called, even though this event is not bound if `c == null` (I am assuming RunAfterTick causes this behavior).\n\nI didn't go with adding a null check inside of `BindingRefresh` since it felt like a symptom of the problem, and I'm starting to get familiar with the scroll panel widget. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12317","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12317/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12317/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12317/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12317","id":186102373,"number":12317,"title":"Fix Lua error message for WPos subtraction","user":{"login":"cjshmyr","id":566742,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/566742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr","html_url":"https://github.com/cjshmyr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjshmyr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-10-29T21:36:37Z","updated_at":"2016-10-30T14:51:38Z","closed_at":"2016-10-30T14:51:38Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/12317","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12317","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12317.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12317.patch"},"body":"This updates the Lua error message shown if a script screws up subtracting a WPos, and also fixes one of the `string.Format` parameters.

RA gap generators have never worked very well in our RA mod – our additions of the fog of war, initially explored map, and (until recently) GPS satellite dots made them relatively useless.\r\n\r\nWe had planned to make them more useful by actively blocking unit sight instead of just turning a circle of fog into shroud.  Not surprisingly... nobody wanted to actually code the feature, so it fell off the radar and other easier changes were made instead (changing \"Disable Shroud\" &rarr; \"Explore Map\", hiding GPS dots, etc).\r\n\r\n~~#12267~~ #12308 added the last real prerequisite for this (supporting multiple `RevealsShroud` traits on an actor), so I feel this is the right time to try and push this feature through.\r\n\r\nThis reorganizes the internal `Shroud` plumbing to reduce duplication and adds a new \"passive\" reveal type that has lower precedence than generated shroud.  ~~The RA mod rules are then updated to give all actors half their normal vision range for gap-generated cells.~~\r\n\r\nThe effect ingame looks like this (gap generator is to the left of the tank):\r\n![gap2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/167819/19705218/25835be8-9b03-11e6-9f20-f194b7ddf0a1.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12307/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12306","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12306/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12306/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12306/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12306","id":185196594,"number":12306,"title":"Out-of-Sync

made a map with a lot of effort. Took me a coule of months to create it so that it is as beatufull as possible, that it is balanced for both teams qua ore placement and such. But the idea of the map is to make a map that looks like the standard map of league of legends but then in red alert. I have a lot of requests for scripting and i would like to get help with that as i am not able to do the scripting. if this is not possible (when i can get contact with somewone willing to do this for me) then my request is just to repair the map and upload it without the scripting, aswell as some coorperation in taking a look at the map for improvements. Plzz let me know if there is someone willing to do this and give me an email so i can send it to you. The map that i have on my pc crashes now all the time i try to loadit even in skirmisch mode. So i think that has to do with some updates that came in later on. Besides that a guy named zjordy tried to script it and uplaod it but he did a terrible job at it. and uploaded the map while its completely wrongly scripted, it crashes, and he quited half way the attempt to finish it. The map name is Summoners rift. the same name of the map in league of legends.  (so maybe you  can find it allready online, but that is the uploaded version with the crappy scripting of zjordy. Sorry if i insult zjordy with this. that is not my intention. I just want to finish this map on which i put so much effor in to make it). TIf there is someone willing to help me with this i will send my requests for scripting through email. and ofcource the map that i have on my pc. Forward thatns for the one, if there is someone, willing to help me with this. Sorry for the long story. i just took my medication and im kinda buzzed out :/ anyway i hope to get a reaction soon\n\ncheers Leander Letwory (gamename Ohmk Torque\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12303","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12303/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12303/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12303/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12303","id":184999719,"number":12303,"title":"ranking system","user":{"login":"runeavalon","id":22977084,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/22977084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/runeavalon","html_url":"https://github.com/runeavalon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runeavalon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runeavalon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runeavalon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runeavalon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runeavalon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runeavalon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runeavalon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runeavalon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runeavalon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-10-25T01:58:47Z","updated_at":"2016-10-25T20:49:52Z","closed_at":"2016-10-25T20:49:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I really think (and i asked a lot in the lobby, lots of ppl agree) that you guys should imply a ranking system to insure that the matches are allways balanced.
