The limited situations where the GAP effect was in play showed a definite effect in support of the user's defensive structure, limiting the opponent's base push by extending extra vision from one side. Sporadic examples of vehicle based armies entering poor engagements vs other armies or base fortifications coupled with the GAP defense structure or an MGG.\r\n\r\nInitial values set by pure hypothesis. Real valuable data won't be possible until the GAP effect is part of the official release/playtest in order to make prolonged playtesting available. The initial values was set intentionally \"soft\" as not to break game balance and at the same time allow for the overall player base to experience generated GAP shroud with the next release/playtest. The values' effectiveness in game-play is in the dark but due to the natural unpredictability of gameplay development the appearance of more GAP generators, MGG's during the next release cycle is at least plausible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12690/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12689","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12689/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12689/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12689/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12689","id":205340031,"number":12689,"title":"Exception of type `System.ArgumentException`: Illegal characters in path.","user":{"login":"ibrokemypie","id":7827846,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7827846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibrokemypie","html_url":"https://github.com/ibrokemypie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibrokemypie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibrokemypie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibrokemypie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibrokemypie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibrokemypie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibrokemypie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibrokemypie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibrokemypie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibrokemypie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382357,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Crash","name":"Crash","color":"e10c02","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-02-04T10:50:48Z","updated_at":"2017-02-08T09:34:21Z","closed_at":"2017-02-04T11:15:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Crashes immediately upon selecting RA2 in mods.
