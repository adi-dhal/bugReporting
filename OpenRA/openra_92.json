And, of course, the diff and risk of regressions would go up considerably.\n\n_Note2_: The upgrade rule did work on two maps, but then I ran into a bug in our map upgrading so I had to use a slightly modified version of my previous MapFormat upgrade rule to apply it to all maps.\nAdditionally, I ran into a zlib error when trying to upgrade the `.oramap` packages, so I could only fix the unzipped maps (though I'm not sure we ship any packaged maps which have these specific actors pre-placed.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11372","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11372/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11372/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11372/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11372","id":157379095,"number":11372,"title":"[RA] Add operation-goldmine.oramap","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-05-29T10:11:42Z","updated_at":"2016-05-30T18:02:47Z","closed_at":"2016-05-30T18:01:10Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/11372","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11372","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11372.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11372.patch"},"body":"http://resource.openra.net/maps/14344/ (updated)\n\nAn author I've never heard of before with a really nice 4 player map.

mentioned in https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10349.\n\n```\n[15:23] <pchote> you want Exts.PolygonContains\n[15:23] <pchote> for polygon hit testing\n[15:23] <pchote> I think it would be better to have a polygon hit shape instead of footprint\n[15:24] <pchote> because footprints might have holes in them\n[15:24] <pchote> and handling that case makes the code at least 5 times more complicated\n[15:24] <pchote> the other half of the hitshape is distance from polygon, which you get by taking the minimum distance from each line in the shape\n[15:25] <pchote> which i'm pretty sure we have code for\n[15:25] <pchote> just need to enumerate the edges\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11361","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11361/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11361/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11361/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11361","id":157030684,"number":11361,"title":"Add
