#2175 referred to an ability to make a cloaking device. Later in the comment thread, someone mentioned making a structure that works like the GLA tunnel network from C&C Generals.\n\nI haven't seen a specific ticket on this like the comments suggested, so this is to bring the idea up for review.\n\nA structure that can garrison troops and deploy at any other similar structure in the map. If they're all destroyed, the units inside die off. If it's possible to make individual units exit is good; otherwise it can function like APCs and discharge all the units in the network.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/4219842-gla-tunnel-effect?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/6409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4743","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"E149:572D:13FF3E5:308F713:59D6B610","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=258>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=405>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=256>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"19810c8f10fb6f25bf06fa7a46e5c35c\"","status":"200 OK"}}
