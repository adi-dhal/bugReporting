This seems like a power management exploit against the way gap generators create and contribute to the shroud.\n\nIn response, this pull request changes gap generator shroud creation slightly to make it dynamic; when powered down or destroyed, the shroud that it created disappears as well. This shroud is in addition to the \"explored\" shroud, so if a player has not explored an area, they will not gain exploration simply because a gap generator has been destroyed.\n\nThis, of course, paves the way to enable Mobile Gap Generators, which @ScottNZ has graciously been working on recently. The second commit in this pull request enables the mobile gap generators and gives them a shroud creation range of 4.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2610","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2610/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2610/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2610/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/2610","id":10236782,"number":2610,"title":"Make volkov vulnerable to Anti-Personnel mines, and immune to anti-tank mines","user":{"login":"Generalcamo","id":1779662,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1779662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Generalcamo","html_url":"https://github.com/Generalcamo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Generalcamo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Generalcamo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Generalcamo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Generalcamo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Generalcamo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Generalcamo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Generalcamo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Generalcamo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Generalcamo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2013-01-23T15:46:45Z","updated_at":"2014-07-02T16:47:33Z","closed_at":"2013-03-10T23:21:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/2610","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/2610","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/2610.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/2610.patch"},"body":"Why is volkov immune to Anti-Personnel mines, but is killed by Anti-Tank mines?

If the map gets reported on content as crashing map / pathfinding does not work, what to do?\nWhat happends if they update the map? \nCould we get some lines from content about this map? Or just vote from content?\n\n2: when I create maps, I name them 01 02 03, when browsing, it only shows title, that is the same many times.. \n..Confusing, can we solve this?\n\n3: The maps should be moved to another folder on windows, caused by read only problems for some users. If maps include audio the files can be big, where should them be moved later on?\n\n4: Information about maps.. Not sure how the new map browser should be, but in game lobby waiting to start, there should be some information about the game, like \"no ore trucks, collecting ore with choppers\" \nOr \"press here to view yaml\" (great for getting ppl to learn that)\n\n5: List playcount on all maps\n\n6: turn on / of preview of maps..
