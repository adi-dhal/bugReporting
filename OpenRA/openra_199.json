(large) step towards getting rid of `RenderSimple` and all traits based on it, and instead use `RenderSprites` + `WithSpriteBody`-based traits and additional `With*Animation` traits.\n\nThis PR modifies `WithSpriteBody` to be roughly equivalent to `RenderSimple` and introduces `WithFacingSpriteBody` for moving actors with facings, as well as \n1) `WithMoveAnimation` to replace `RenderUnitFlying` special cases and \n2) `WithAttackAnimation` to replace `RenderUnitReload` special case as well as allow the use of `WithFacingSpriteBody` in cases where `WithInfantryBody` would be overkill (example: TS Wolverine Mech).\n\nThis should fix the issue with the Wolverine occasionally getting stuck on the last shooting frame as a side-effect.\n\nOnce DeployToUpgrade lands, we can probably use this to implement TS deployable units better since With*Body is upgradable.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8170","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8170/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8170/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8170/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8170","id":76516836,"number":8170,"title":"TFD

always forget to update this one before releases and it is a binary that should not be stored here. According to http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/ it is updated every first Tuesday of the month. I need some help with PowerShell to update the AppVeyor cache. The rule can probably be simplified to just \"every Tuesday\" or maybe even better some other day of the month to not stress the Maxmind servers when everybody runs his update. It does not need to be bleeding edge, but still update every once in a while.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8149/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4801","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"857C:572D:13F8B2C:308023F:59D6B52E","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=200>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=405>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=198>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"068f21d9121a64d45ab634f9a061e7f1\"","status":"200 OK"}}
