RA2:YR solved this by adding concentric rings, similar to the range circles when placing defensive structures, as seen [here](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tb5HzWQkwVw/USc6t1ri6aI/AAAAAAAAFW8/Lt-AWUIwuzo/s1600/21_red-alert2-yuris-revenge.jpg).\n\nAs the OpenRA atomic bomb has a wider spread and gradual falloff to zero damage, the rings would be more useful if they aligned with damage thresholds, similar to those in [NukeMap](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/) but without area colouring. For example, a ring could be displayed where the damage drops to 10% less than that of previous rings, or at the 99.7%, 95% and 68% intervals, or at the points where various different classes of unit or structure will be instantly destroyed.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on
