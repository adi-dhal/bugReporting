But I have no idea how to fix this problem that appeared out of nowhere, and so far none of the searches I've done on Google or in this Issues section have turned up any results. So if this doesn't belong here, by all means delete/close it.\n\nI've been playing **OpenRA** on **Ubuntu** for several months without any significant issues - most of the errors I run into every now and then are mapmaking-related ones, either by maps I try to create or maps made by other users with problematic tiles or coding. But all of a sudden, I can no longer launch the program without it failing to execute, and I'm not familiar enough with Ubuntu to troubleshoot the problem on my own. I'm too used to a Windows operating system and this one is still relatively foreign to me.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the problem isn't with OpenRA's version, because the most recent one is **20160508**, which I have been using for at least a week or two prior to this problem without any issues.\n\nThis is the output of trying to run \"**openra**\" in **terminal**:\n\n```\nNative stacktrace:\n\n    mono() [0x49ff2f]\n    mono() [0x426c8c]\n    /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0(+0x113d0) [0x7f7b25bd13d0]\n    mono() [0x53e1b8]\n    mono() [0x427361]\n    mono(mono_main+0x2cb) [0x475abb]\n    /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xf0) [0x7f7b25817830]\n    mono(_start+0x29) [0x422e79]\n\nDebug info from gdb:\n\n[New LWP 5877]\n[Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]\nUsing host libthread_db library \"/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libthread_db.so.1\".\n\nGot a SIGSEGV while executing native code. This usually indicates a fatal error in the mono runtime or one of the native libraries used by your application.\n\nAborted (core dumped)\nGtk-Message: GtkDialog mapped without a transient parent. This is discouraged.\n```\n\nThis does not generate any log files in \"**.openra/Logs**\". I even checked this by removing all the log files and re-executing to see if new log files were made, and none were. (I have still kept the log files though, in case I'm incorrect about this and it's not supposed to generate new ones or something?)\n\nI have tried uninstalling OpenRA and then reinstalling, but the issue persists.\n\nI have no idea what to check in order to fix this. My only guess was that one of my packages/dependencies on Unbuntu updated and now  no longer works properly with OpenRA, but I don't know how to check which would cause this or how to fix the problem. I've tried \"**sudo apt-get update**\" on terminal as well, hoping it would further update any related dependencies and squash the issue, but no luck there either.\n\nAny help or insights you might have would be very appreciated. If there's any further info I can provide to help out, I certainly can - I don't know what else to include here yet since the only output I could find of the problem was in terminal.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11677","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11677/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11677/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11677/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11677","id":166453850,"number":11677,"title":"make \"custom rules warning\" more distinguishable","user":{"login":"Micr0Bit","id":9139965,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/9139965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Micr0Bit","html_url":"https://github.com/Micr0Bit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Micr0Bit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Micr0Bit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Micr0Bit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Micr0Bit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Micr0Bit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Micr0Bit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Micr0Bit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Micr0Bit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Micr0Bit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382420,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Idea/Wishlist","name":"Idea/Wishlist","color":"e102d8","default":false},{"id":124120259,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/UI","name":"UI","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-07-19T22:38:33Z","updated_at":"2016-07-23T08:48:47Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"from other server-messages ... \ni thought maybe have the line with a specific color ... \n\ncould do the same when game-options get changed \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11677/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11676","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11676/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11676/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11676/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11676","id":166345264,"number":11676,"title":"Added ScreenMap support for effects","user":{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":117739713,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Changes%20requested","name":"PR: Changes requested","color":"e11d21","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2016-07-19T14:27:30Z","updated_at":"2017-09-16T12:47:25Z","closed_at":"2017-08-20T10:40:27Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/11676","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11676","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11676.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11676.patch"},"body":"now with laser :red_circle: and tesla :zap: support.

Since you use the latter way more often and there is no way of cancelling during production right now.\nI think the behaviour as it is now is annoying, only that one got used to it :D (\"hold! \"\"hold!\"\"cancelled!\")\nEDIT: Middle-mouse button cancels during production. However, not all mouses have middle mouse buttons!\n\n_[please ignore following section, see comment below]_\nAlso, an infinite modifier would be nice: \nctrl+lmb (adds one unit to a \"infinite queue\")\n\nThe infinite queue behaviour could be like this:\n- produce x units as ordred, then go to next order\n- if there are no more ordinary orders, check infinite queue entries and add one round of them to the production queue order list\n- in the UI a little infinity sign would show before the ammount of units ordered in one round\n- additional unit orders of the same type add/substract allways from the infinite queue (so there cannot be an ordinary and infinite order in parallel)\n\ni.e. suppose 5 rocket troopers are in a queue. Shift+crl+lmb(rocket soldier icon) would add 5 more rocket soldiers and transform this order into an infinite queue order. (Rocket sodier icon)^(inf 10)\n\nThanks, i hope we will see at least rmb-hold and crtl+shift-cancel soon in the future :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11674","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11674/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11674/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11674/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11674","id":166314404,"number":11674,"title":"Listing an actor in Cargo.InitialUnits which grants an upgrade through Passenger won't be applied to the transport.","user":{"login":"GraionDilach","id":1136302,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1136302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach","html_url":"https://github.com/GraionDilach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GraionDilach/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382400,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"d7e102","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-07-19T12:02:49Z","updated_at":"2016-08-10T11:01:40Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11674/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11673","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11673/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11673/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11673/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11673","id":166294617,"number":11673,"title":"Added a filter for repeated move orders","user":{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-07-19T10:08:39Z","updated_at":"2016-07-30T13:47:27Z","closed_at":"2016-07-30T13:47:27Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/11673","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11673","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11673.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11673.patch"},"body":"as suggested in https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3923#issuecomment-34561991.

I had a similar grievance awhile ago when OpenRA install incorrectly, resulting it graphical glitches ingame. The usual method of uninstalling & reinstalling the program didn't fix the problem tho. Because unbeknown to me there were files in My Documents that had been corrupted during installation & uninstalling OpenRA didn't remove these files. Reinstalling didn't rewrite them either, so I had to find & delete them manually before I could do a clean reinstall.\n\nhttp://www.ppmforums.com/viewtopic.php?t=42305 highlights that we require manual intervention to correct corrupted files.  This is still a problem with the new system, which unconditionally skips any files that already exist.\n\nWe should add at least a length check (but ideally a proper checksum) to validate content when deciding whether to overwrite or skip it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11661/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4918","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"A870:01FA:BB6D35:1A5A021:59D6B36D","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=83>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=405>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=81>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"6b38794c8179dea09c69a27fe2ac6704\"","status":"200 OK"}}
