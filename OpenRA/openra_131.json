Create a new custom map (it can be a simple empty map), name it & save it (default location \"^maps/ra\") \n2. Play the map (skirmish, you can surrender) \n3. (optional) Verify that the replay is working \n\nOn bleed: \n4. Play the same map (skirmish, surrender) \n5. (optional) Verify that the new replay works also \n\nBack on playtest \n5. Ty to load the replay of the previous (first) game \nIt should report \"Unknown map\" and there is no thumbnail for the replay. \n\nTo fix it: \nOpen the map in the playtest's editor (it normally shows in browser) and just save it unchanged (overwrite). Again the default location here is \"^maps/ra\" for me. \n\nThis only happens if you play the playtest's map with bleed (and come back to playtest) and not with current release (which is older than the current playtest) \n\nIt also doesn't happen with official maps - just custom ones.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/28929206-playtest-replays-not-working-unknown-map-after-same-custom-map-played-on-bleed?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10192/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10191","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10191/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10191/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10191/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10191","id":120803541,"number":10191,"title":"Add support for a FallbackSequence in WithDeathAnimation","user":{"login":"abcdefg30","id":7704140,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7704140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30","html_url":"https://github.com/abcdefg30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":13,"created_at":"2015-12-07T15:53:59Z","updated_at":"2016-02-21T09:20:11Z","closed_at":"2016-02-21T09:18:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/10191","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10191","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10191.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10191.patch"},"body":"Used when the actor is killed by non-standard means, like suicide.\nSplit from #9350.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4869","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"D717:572D:13F0F80:306CB71:59D6B42B","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=132>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=405>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=130>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"62cdfedc345e152fdc41665737e87089\"","status":"200 OK"}}
