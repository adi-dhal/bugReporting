One of the pieces in particular makes the wall completely invisible, which is annoying and the cause for #5654.  This fixes that by getting rid of those last set of images.\n\n`Explanation of why they are false damage states for walls + lengthy post warning:`\nI'm not 100% sure by any means, but the final set of 16 images appear to be end pieces for the wall segments so that they look more \"full\".  If you build a single wall, then build one right next to it, you will notice that the original wall segment almost looks like it gets cut in half on the side not connected to the new wall segment.  I believe this space is supposed to be filled with the end pieces so that it looks more \"full\" and complete.\n\nSee the comparison below which shows what it looks like without these end pieces and with them on the center area where the vertical and horizontal wall segments meet together.\n\nwithout them..\n![withoutendpieces](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7218092/3488325/0ac4fc58-04dd-11e4-90bd-3226049fd0c2.png)\n\nand with them..\n![withendpieces](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7218092/3488326/21a6ae80-04dd-11e4-8128-fe2fff536327.png)\n\nwithout the end pieces looks odd, as if it's missing something, and its very noticable when trying to place a new wall segment there.  I took the \"with\" end pieces picture by using the bleed version's bug where the final damage state is not a proper damage state, here you can clearly see that it is probably an end piece and not a proper damage state for the wall.  The final fix to make use of these end pieces is probably not that difficult, but will likely only be compatible with TD and RA, and not TS, so I would hate to introduce an incompatibility into the wall code if we expect to be able to make use of it for TS as well.  But for now, this removes the bogus wall damage states!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5835/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5834","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5834/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5834/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5834/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5834","id":37212489,"number":5834,"title":"Increase Chinook landing speed and removed turn before landing.","user":{"login":"Squiggles211","id":7218092,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7218092?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Squiggles211","html_url":"https://github.com/Squiggles211","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Squiggles211/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Squiggles211/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Squiggles211/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Squiggles211/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Squiggles211/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Squiggles211/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Squiggles211/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Squiggles211/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Squiggles211/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-07-06T06:02:29Z","updated_at":"2014-07-06T06:32:30Z","closed_at":"2014-07-06T06:19:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/5834","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5834","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5834.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5834.patch"},"body":"Fixes #5054, Allows for any helicopter to choose to turn to the initial facing before landing, and sets the default to disable the turn since this only affects the chinook.

found this bug by sending an existing helicopter (hind) to be serviced on the helipad, while another was under construction. The helicopter was still on the pad at the point of completion of the new helicopter; when the construction was completed, only 1 unit left the helipad.\n\nThis was particularly noticeable as the existing unit was team 0 - after the new unit was created, team 0 was no longer assigned.\n\nThis looks related to the new behaviour of the allied helipad (previously it would have said \"unable to build more\" while another unit was on the pad, particularly if a queue was in place, but now they leave the pad automatically).\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty

played around and made some observations.\n- `public int nearEnough = 1;` is the only value that makes sense as 0 crashes the game and 2 will be too far away for the default exit and rally point distance. Also the value is looked up somewhere else and not even configurable so why was this even a public field.\n- MoveWithinRange seems to be a bad choice for rally point movement as units are allowed to give up too early. We want them to move directly to that point not stand somewhere near it blocking the exit. This fixes #5682.\n\nThe StyleCop violations and legacy int[] fields to parse a 2D vector coordinate make this look like code that has not been touched for years. Hope this removes some bit rot.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5814/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5813","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5813/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5813/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5813/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5813","id":37168289,"number":5813,"title":"Instant filtering by file name in the asset browser","user":{"login":"pavlos256","id":311595,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/311595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlos256","html_url":"https://github.com/pavlos256","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlos256/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlos256/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlos256/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlos256/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlos256/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlos256/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlos256/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlos256/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavlos256/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-07-04T13:37:18Z","updated_at":"2014-08-30T20:18:50Z","closed_at":"2014-07-04T14:01:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/5813","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5813","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5813.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5813.patch"},"body":"The filter matches partial file names, is case-insensitive and is applied instantly, without clicking a button.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5812","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5812/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5812/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5812/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5812","id":37166077,"number":5812,"title":"Fixed the AI choosing rallypoints on land for shipyards","user":{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-07-04T13:00:56Z","updated_at":"2014-07-05T06:16:01Z","closed_at":"2014-07-04T23:22:00Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/5812","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5812","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5812.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/5812.patch"},"body":"I hope this improves Naval AI and performance as it avoids impossible pathings.
