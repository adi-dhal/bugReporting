A `--map-info` or `--dry-run` flag should output the yaml from the api query without actively installing the map.

greatly improves performance by not syncing the world state for every single order processed as this becomes very expensive, at the cost of being unable to directly pinpoint the order that causes a desync. Instead the granularity of detecting desyncs is reduced to the tick level.\n\nAs noted in https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9008#issuecomment-129202470, in the worst case scenario of running a max speed replay with high orders rates (due to many players, particularly AI in this case), this could represent upto 50% of CPU!\n\nOnly syncing once per tick will benefit tick times when:\n- Overall orders rates are high (e.g. due to many players or players with high APM (such as AI))\n- An order is given to large groups of units (this should reduce the lag spike significantly)\n\nThe disadvantage is that in the event of a desync we won't know what specific order caused it, instead we will only know the frame the desync occurred in. This is hopefully a worthwhile tradeoff.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9022/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9021","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9021/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9021/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9021/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9021","id":99913834,"number":9021,"title":"Refactor AI squads","user":{"login":"reaperrr","id":2857877,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2857877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperrr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":124732140,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/AI","name":"AI","color":"486b79","default":false},{"id":33146668,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Refactor","name":"Refactor","color":"00FFCC","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-08-09T17:01:21Z","updated_at":"2015-08-09T19:31:36Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Our current squad system is way too random, gives us way too little control and causes way too many issues (see #9008 for a good example).\n\nWe should implement something more like this:\n\n``` yaml\nHackyAI:\n  Squad@naval1:\n    Name: naval1\n    SquadType: Naval\n    TargetScanRadius: 10\n    ScanAroundActorTypes: NavalProduction\n    MaximumSquadSize: 5\n    MaximumCount: 1 # don't build this squad if there are already this many squads of this type\n    Probability: 30 # probability that AI will decide to produce this squad (relative to other squads of this SquadType)\n    ValidTargets: Water # only actively look for and move towards these target types\n    SquadComposition:\n      sub: 10%\n      msub: 10%\n      pt: 20%\n      dd: 10%\n      ca: 5%\n    CompositionMaximums:\n      sub: 5\n      msub: 3\n      pt: 5\n      dd: 3\n      ca: 2\n  Squad@ground1:\n    Name: ground1\n    SquadType: Ground\n    TargetScanRadius: 10\n    ScanAroundActorTypes: BaseBuilder\n    MaximumSquadSize: 15\n    MaximumCount: 3\n    Probability: 60\n    ValidTargets: Ground\n    SquadComposition:\n      e3: 20%\n      ltnk: 20%\n      mtnk: 20%\n      arty: 20%\n      jeep: 20%\n    CompositionMaximums:\n      e3: 3\n      ltnk: 3\n      mtnk: 5\n      arty: 3\n      jeep: 2\n```\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue?
