This removes all of the stencil/depth buffer clears and allows shadows to done without a special shader.\n\nSummary of important changes:\n- Adds FBO / render-to-texture support to Graphics.SdlCommon (minspec now requires GL_ARB_framebuffer_object).\n- Allows texture data to be read back from the GPU.\n- Adds a geometry visualization debug layer.\n- Supports sprites with a built-in render offset (implements half of #3287).\n- Removes nearest-pixel position rounding from SpriteRenderer - things that need this have plenty of opportunity to round themselves beforehand.\n- Introduces a BeforeRender method on IRenderable.\n- Exposes alpha blending to renderer code (was previously hardcoded on).\n- Removes stencil buffer support.\n- Other refactoring to support the above.\n\nA future patch will be able to cache sprites based on the input arguments to give a serious perf win for large groups of units, but that can wait until we actually need it.\n\nScreenshot of the geometry visualization:\n![renderdebug](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/167819/657828/439c51e4-d58f-11e2-8ed1-6975c8f299a5.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3406","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3406/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3406/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3406/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3406","id":15587098,"number":3406,"title":"NRE
