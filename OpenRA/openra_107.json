distros are slowly migrating to mono >= 4, and most of them don't seem to be including support for the 4.0 SDK (probably because, as far as I understand, this relies on shipping binaries that can no longer be compiled from source).  This then leads to issues like #10248 and #10726.\n\nThis removes the forced SDK from the default makefile, but keeps it for our travis builds (which use the Xamarin mono builds that _do_ have 4.0 support) to retain compatibility with .NET 4 on windows.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10935/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10934","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10934/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10934/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10934/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10934","id":141418593,"number":10934,"title":"Make objectives panel visible to spectators/observers","user":{"login":"obrakmann","id":4331210,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4331210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann","html_url":"https://github.com/obrakmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obrakmann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2016-03-16T22:15:36Z","updated_at":"2016-03-27T13:00:11Z","closed_at":"2016-03-27T12:58:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/10934","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10934","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10934.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10934.patch"},"body":"It also allows switching the context of the panel by selecting a certain player's view in the player view spectator drop down.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10934/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10933","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10933/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10933/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10933/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10933","id":141294279,"number":10933,"title":"Replay hotkeys for pause/play/change of speed","user":{"login":"Hanzik","id":5736517,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5736517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hanzik","html_url":"https://github.com/Hanzik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hanzik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hanzik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hanzik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hanzik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hanzik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hanzik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hanzik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hanzik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hanzik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2016-03-16T14:38:49Z","updated_at":"2016-03-21T20:32:10Z","closed_at":"2016-03-21T20:30:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/10933","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10933","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10933.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10933.patch"},"body":"Related to #8972.

takes #10676 and changes `MusicInfo` to use the new `LengthInSeconds` property.\n\nThe original SoundFormat implementations would load the entire file up-front, which is overkill when we are only interested in the length.  I've worked around that by splitting out proper format detection methods, and then lazily loading the raw bytes only when needed.  This can later be changed to use proper streaming.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10912/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10911","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10911/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10911/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10911/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10911","id":140378708,"number":10911,"title":"Fix Smoke facings to not track spawner's facing","user":{"login":"reaperrr","id":2857877,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2857877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperrr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-03-12T12:24:51Z","updated_at":"2016-03-12T13:37:50Z","closed_at":"2016-03-12T13:35:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/10911","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10911","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10911.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10911.patch"},"body":"Closes #10894.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10911/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4893","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"D3FE:572C:15CE420:2B51011:59D6B3CF","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=108>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=405>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=106>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"3878330dbf727e835c6d1f3234f10762\"","status":"200 OK"}}
