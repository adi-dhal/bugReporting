Speed choices are great, but the current choices are essentially \"slow, but i can micro\", \"too fast for micro\" and \"unplayable\" (not taking into account lagging games). \r\n\r\nThe goal would be to make \"Brisk\" play at the fastest speed where you can still micro (albeit with increased effort).\r\n\r\nA speed between normal and faster would be great for a few things, IMO. \r\n\r\n**League matches:** I believe currently the RAGL rules allow the home player to choose normal or faster when playing their \"home game\", however, no-one chooses faster - likely cause of the fact its VERY hard to micro at all. a \"Brisk\" speed would allow a macro player to take back some of the micro advantage from a good micro player and help mix things up a bit by using game speed as a part of your tactic to beat another player.\r\n\r\n**Streaming:** SoScared has used faster in the past when unknown players play on stream. This has been to ensure games get into the action quicker and are finished quicker (in case the players are terrible and or uninteresting to watch). It's essentially a very sensible choice for a streamer, but not fair to the players. Brisk may be a happy medium and a good solution to this.\r\n\r\n**Time poor casual players:** We all have lives and jobs, between which we try to play as much OpenRA as possible. If \"Brisk\" becomes a reality, maybe i can fit another game into the time i have available to play that evening - while still retaining the core experience.\r\n\r\n**Anti Lag for 1v1 games:** When playing people with suspicious latency, Brisk might be a good way to get an anti lag effect without game-breaking speed if the game does not lag (as opposed to using faster for this purpose).\r\n\r\n**Tool for practicing your micro:** If you can learn to micro whilst on Brisk, you should see your normal speed game micro abilities improve!\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to express exactly how much faster I'm talking about, but I will put it in the following terms: At normal speed a nuke takes 9 mins to charge, on faster it takes 6:45. Brisk should be around 7:45-8mins to charge a nuke.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12508","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12508/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12508/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12508/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12508","id":197487991,"number":12508,"title":"Added Tiberian Sun map Forest Fires","user":{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-12-25T05:23:05Z","updated_at":"2016-12-28T14:31:52Z","closed_at":"2016-12-28T14:31:51Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/12508","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12508","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12508.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12508.patch"},"body":"This already imported fine since https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11441 http://resource.openra.net/maps/15973/ but with added demolition and repair https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12430 it is even more playable.\r\n\r\nReference: http://cnc.wikia.com/wiki/Forest_Fires","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12508/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12507","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12507/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12507/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12507/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12507","id":197481448,"number":12507,"title":"TD Balance Changes 12242016.","user":{"login":"AoAGeneral","id":7693928,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7693928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral","html_url":"https://github.com/AoAGeneral","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AoAGeneral/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":23,"created_at":"2016-12-24T23:48:58Z","updated_at":"2017-01-02T17:15:56Z","closed_at":"2017-01-02T17:15:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/12507","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12507","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12507.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12507.patch"},"body":"Add detection to temple of Nod.\r\n(Nice to have detection then stealthers sneaking by it)\r\n\r\nartillery minimum range increase from 2c896 to 3c0.\r\n\r\nmammoth tank HP increase from 800 to 870.\r\n(Dies by medium tank spams and e3 a little to easily from recent changes.

Doing less damage then infantry and getting squashed by medium tanks and light tanks. This will make players think twice about squashing tactics. Also more damage vs armored defenses.)\r\n\r\nGrenadier accuracy reduced from 213 to 813. (Makes them miss a lot more).\r\n(Grenadiers were to accurate and unable to kill infantry packs. Looking at CNC95 and RA in ORA they miss their targets as well. Having them miss spreads their AoE damage and able to take out infantry packs.

Increasing their timer slightly also increases other viable builds.)\r\n\r\nHarvester HP increase from 600 to 625.\r\n(Both medium tanks and bikes doing a little to much damage. Compensates slightly for build timer)\r\n\r\nRefinery power reduced from 50 to 40.\r\n(Offers more build choices. Opening barracks becomes stronger then going strip/factory all the time. Both openings strong strats just requires scouting.)\r\n\r\nRefinery sell no longer refunds.\r\n(Includes with the harv spamming. Gave 250 back which counted towards buggy/bike money.

But it opts people to protect refineries rather then \"Lost a ref. Meh. Got 3 others.\". Losing a ref now loses earned money. If it holds money. Also prevents sell trick to save power.)\r\n\r\nSilo hold increase from 2000 to 3000.\r\n(Compensate for Refinery. Also has extra HP now. See below.)\r\n\r\nAGT HP from 600 to 550.\r\n(Way to strong when it came to units coming to these in mass amounts. Also hard for artillery units to shell due to small box size and HP pool.)\r\n\r\nLight Tank price reduced from 700 to 650.\r\n(700 was a bit to high. 650 seems to hit the right spot but left build time as is. 0:17)\r\n\r\nVisceroid spawn reduce from 10 to 5.\r\n(This was a weird one. Infantry dieing in tiberium was at a good spot. But for some reason when chems kill infantry it would create 2-3 visceroids. Then those visceroids would create 2-3 at a time. RNG issue so was reduced.)\r\n\r\nIncrease all building HP by 100.\r\n(Help balance vs medium tanks, bikes, light tanks, chems, grenadiers, air units, and stealth tanks.)\r\n\r\nGun turret HP increase from 400 to 410.\r\n(This is taking baby steps. I want them a little tougher vs medium tanks but not at the point of RA style. Same logic as obrakmann taking baby steps with MCV.)\r\n\r\nStarting units adjusted.\r\n(This created a big problem in competitive scenes. Having early units is good to prevent infantry rushes. But starting with a bike/apc while your opponent starts with a hummer/buggy is to off balancing.)\r\n\r\nMCV build time decreased from 1:36 to 1:00. (3750)\r\n(Price unchanged. Takes a little to long in team games and some 1v1 scenarios to get one built. Also now drains money faster to compensate)\r\n\r\nEngineer HP increase from 25 to 30.\r\n(Dies a little to quick hummers/buggies. Same kill time as minigunner (If takes a hit while standing)\r\n\r\nAPC HP increase from 210 to 215.\r\n(These are dieing a little to fast and weak vs certian units. IE: buggies/hummers and bikes.

Having a slightly faster build timer of 0:14 instead of 0:15 will help too. Helps to withstand early onslaught of Nod. Keep note bikes still 0:12 timer)\r\n\r\n(Created new Sam weapon Dragon from RA e3 AA. Reason: Shared weapon with AGT.)\r\n\r\nSamsite range increased from 8c0 to 12c0.\r\n(Dedicated AA.

You need units/structures to make good use of its range.)\r\n\r\nSamsite now fires two shots at a time.\r\n(Increases damage and intuitive to home base of CNC95.)\r\n\r\nRecon Bike HP decreased from 120 to 110.\r\n(Takes to long to kill these units when vs minigunners and light vehicle types. APCs taking to long to kill these.)\r\n\r\nAirstrip/Weapon Factory power increased from 30 to 50.\r\n(Increased like a disease. Nod players going with an extremely fast 4 strip build without com center. GDI maxing at 3 factories with non stop vehicles.

Extremely accurate as is and to strong vs several units. Shorter range allows faster vehicles to reach them better.)\r\n\r\nMRLS damage vs none reduced from 35 to 25.\r\n(To much damage vs infantry.

A future PR could, in principle, add additional hooks to switch between `@1x` and `@2x` UI artwork too.\r\n* Adding a scale factor to decouple font glyph sizes from system point sizes.\r\n\r\nThe main goal here is the massive improvement in text quality, but this also gives us full detail rendering of the half-zoom state in the editor and takes some baby steps towards #10382.\r\n\r\n~~Enabling HiDPI under windows requires P/Invoking a native Win32 API (not sure why SDL2 doesn't do this), and Linux is a giant clusterfuck, so this PR is strictly limited to OSX.~~\r\n\r\nBefore (click for full resolution):\r\n<img width=\"1680\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/167819/21463565/f2938e22-c962-11e6-99cb-54b019c06a30.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter (click for full resolution):\r\n<img width=\"1680\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/167819/21463557/d9a8e77c-c962-11e6-8980-42cf5443c320.png\">\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12501/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4946","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"E77F:572A:6F458A:FA928A:59D6B2FC","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=55>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=405>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=53>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"8fa0dba1878bddf3f9372ebfbaac0658\"","status":"200 OK"}}
