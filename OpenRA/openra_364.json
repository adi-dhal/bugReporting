case:\n- Start a game with no other clients\n- Open the menu\n- Close the menu and then immediately open it again by double-tapping escape\n- Close the menu, and the game remains paused.\n\nThis happens because the non-zero order lag means that the unpause order hasn't been processed by the second menu opening, so the menu code thinks that it was a user-initiated pause and doesn't unpause when closing the menu.\n\nThe simplest fix would be to track the state locally as well as via orders, and use the local copy for deciding what to do on menu
