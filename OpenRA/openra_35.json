Now it has: \r\n\r\n- A set of preset color swatches for RA1 and TD, (defined in mod.yaml: TeamColorPresets: C4B060, 4494E4, ....)\r\n\r\n- A user-defined palette defined in settings.yaml (Player: CustomColors: 3B99CA, A33BCA, ....)\r\n\r\n![openra color picker](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1639681/24783881/69daa73c-1b92-11e7-8972-703ef7709b2f.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis is my first time contributing to this project so hopefully I have done it correctly and haven't broken any rules.\r\n\r\nI'd also like to know what preset colors were available in d2k, TS, and RA2 so I can add them into the mod.yaml for each of these mods. Does anyone happen to know?\r\n\r\nCheers","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13072/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13071","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13071/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13071/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13071/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13071","id":219854999,"number":13071,"title":"Display team arrangement in Lobby and Replay","user":{"login":"rob-v","id":16348750,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/16348750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v","html_url":"https://github.com/rob-v","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob-v/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/13","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestone/13","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/13/labels","id":930452,"number":13,"title":"Future","description":"This milestone is meant for stuff we want fixed, but don't have a timeline for yet.
