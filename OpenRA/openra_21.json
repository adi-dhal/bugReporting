The building will be C's, for now. But if the mind controller dies, at the time of mind control, it was A's so the building will be returned to A's.

ownership change for units that are already mind controlled)\r\n\r\nTo prevent that, OnOwnerChange notifier must be modified to deliver extra information on what activity changed the ownership so that

(and currently affects D2K thumper)\r\n\r\nSince WithSpriteBody and WithInfantryBody have quite a different animation management, it seems suitable to introduce an IPlayCustomAnimation interface for those that provide custom animation logics. Sounds sensible, it has potential to support animated voxel deployer.\r\n\r\nTo test this, run D2K mod then deploy a thumper. Unfortunately, thumper deploy animation (make sequence in thumper entry) is only 5 frames long and is too short to see. Extend its length for testing purpose if needed. Currently, thumper can move while the lengthy deploy/undeploy animation is playing. That is probably due to GrantConditionOnDeploy not taking away mobility while the animation is playing. (or is it the YAML not using Undeployed for the mobile condition?)\r\n\r\nDemo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4jyIDtD72s\r\n\r\nFixes
