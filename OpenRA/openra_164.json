aud files (at least those usable by TD/RA) use an interleaved format where every other byte contains two samples from alternating left and right channels. To decode this correctly into interleaved PCM, the two samples per byte need separating and the two channels also need to be decoded using separate variables for index, offset and currentSample.\n\nAlthough no aud files made by WW exist in this format for either TD or RA, there are now improved quality scores that are in this format.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back
