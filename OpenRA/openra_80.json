cause of the crash was that the `RemoveSmudge` method only invokes `SharedRandom` in the else-branch of an if condition that is only taken when the `RenderPlayer` has fog visibility on the location (locations the `RenderPlayer` can see get removed from `dirty` in `TickRender`).\n\nTo add insult to injury, the `Type` field does not even need to get set since [we are only using the `Sprite` field's null value as a marker to be picked up by the `TickRender` method](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/e13fa2d474a963d4148ab1db7407fb84b0f90016/OpenRA.Mods.Common/Traits/World/SmudgeLayer.cs#L189). [The `Type` field is only ever used twice in `AddSmudge`](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/e13fa2d474a963d4148ab1db7407fb84b0f90016/OpenRA.Mods.Common/Traits/World/SmudgeLayer.cs#L155-L159), in a branch of an if-condition [that will not be taken when the `Sprite` field is null](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/e13fa2d474a963d4148ab1db7407fb84b0f90016/OpenRA.Mods.Common/Traits/World/SmudgeLayer.cs#L145), which we set explicitly. The same holds true for the `Depth` field.\n\nFixes #11660.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4920","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"E962:572A:6F5690:FAB836:59D6B365","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=81>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=405>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=79>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"a573b4dc5968e96dae79cb65770e6341\"","status":"200 OK"}}
