#11953.\nFixes #5995.\nFixes #7545.\nFixes #7481.\n\nThe important part of this change is the `MayYieldReservation` flag on `Aircraft`. It is set after an aircraft finished resupplying, and will cause it to be kicked off the airfield by the `Reservable` trait if another aircraft tries to get a reservation.\n\nOne change wrt to bleed that I couldn't find a solution for is that producing a plane will block the newly-built plane as long as the other one is still resupplying, but will cause both to take off once its done.\n\nEven with this change, there can still (rarely) arise situations where airfields will get locked by a reservation. From the way it looked in my tests, it seemed that the aircraft that took the reservation was unable to find the proper approach to land on the airfield. I didn't yet look deeper into it, as it seemed unrelated to the issue being dealt with by this PR.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11956/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11955","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11955/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11955/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11955/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11955","id":174902242,"number":11955,"title":"GPS

Also fixes #8146 and resolves #8704.\n\nFirst off, this _properly_ fixes the sell-place-animation bug by adding proper checks to `WithBuildingPlacedAnimation`. It then changes `BaseProvider` to disable building placement around a locked construction yard, and `Production` to disable units from being produced from locked factories.  Finally, it removes the tech-disabling hack that causes #8122.\n\nIn practice this should give the following gameplay changes in RA:\n- When capturing is triggered on a player's only construction yard: production of structures will continue but they cannot be placed around it (previously: construction was cancelled)\n- When capturing is triggered on a construction yard, and the player has multiple: structures cannot be placed around the locked yard (previously: could be placed there)\n- When capturing is triggered on a player's only factory: production of units will continue but they will stop at the \"Ready\" phase, like when the exit is blocked (previously: construction was cancelled)\n- When capturing is triggered on a factory, and the player has multiple: units will not come out of the locked factory, even if it is the primary (previously: they would).\n\nMods that don't use external capturing shouldn't be affected, because locking is only otherwise used as part of things that permanently disable the actor (transform, sell, instant capture).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11951/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11950","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11950/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11950/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11950/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11950","id":174886239,"number":11950,"title":"Fixed
