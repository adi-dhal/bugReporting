You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages. You can even update your data structure without breaking deployed programs that are compiled against the \"old\" format._\n -- https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview\n\nAny object can be serialized, you no longer have to rely on cramming information into limited fields WINAPI-style. Instead, order classes can be tailored to suit the trait. Because object identification is based on a lookup table provided by the ObjectCreator, this allows huge bandwidth savings compared to the legacy string based identification tags. A typical move command in the current state might serialize as `MoveAAAABXXXXYYYY` but a ProtoContract version could generally be this sort of length: `SMAABXY`, less than half the size, easily saving megabytes of bandwidth.\n\nHere's an example of the legacy order format as a data contract:\n\n```\n    [ProtoContract]\n    public struct CPos : IScriptBindable, ILuaAdditionBinding, ILuaSubtractionBinding, ILuaEqualityBinding, ILuaTableBinding, IEquatable<CPos>\n    {\n        [ProtoMember(1)] public readonly int X;\n        [ProtoMember(2)] public readonly int Y;\n...\n    }\n\n    [ProtoContract]\n    sealed class LegacyOrder\n    {\n        [ProtoMember(1)] public string OrderString;\n        [ProtoMember(2)] public uint SubjectID;\n        [ProtoMember(3)] public bool Queued;\n        [ProtoMember(4)] public uint TargetActorID;\n        [ProtoMember(5)] public CPos TargetLocation;\n        [ProtoMember(6)] public string TargetString;\n        [ProtoMember(7)] public CPos ExtraLocation;\n        [ProtoMember(8)] public uint ExtraData;\n    }\n```\n\nContracts can be used to upgrade the OpenRA packet format, enforcing compile-time safety and even compressing the top level fields such as that \"Frame\" integer.\n\n```\n    [ProtoContract]\n    sealed class Packet\n    {\n        [ProtoMember(1)] public readonly uint ClientID;\n        [ProtoMember(2)] public readonly uint Frame;\n        [ProtoMember(3)] public readonly byte[] Data;\n    }\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7440","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7440/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7440/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7440/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7440","id":56931647,"number":7440,"title":"update

whole intent of this pull request is basically to review and discuss the changes I introduced in the pathfinder architecture and algorithm, find better solutions and guide the development to a better version. According to unit test benchmarks and some playtests I've thrown in, I've achieved approximately a 20% increased performance in the pathfinder. However, I need some help in order to implement integration tests to make some real and better pathfinding benchmarking as it seems quite complex to create Map, Actor and World instances and I'm not fully aware of how it works.\n\nIf someone wants to test in-game differences between legacy pathfinder and the new pathfinder, he or she should simply go to the file OpenRA.Mods.Common\\Traits\\World\\Pathfinder\\PathFinderInfo.cs and change the line \"return new PathFinderCacheDecorator(new PathFinder(init.World), new PathCacheStorage(init.World));\" to \"return new PathFinderCacheDecorator(new LegacyPathFinder(init.World), new PathCacheStorage(init.World));\". This is one of the advantages of the changes I introduced, it's rather easy to switch implementation strategies.\n\nThe next steps after re-architecting the pathfinder should be to improve the A\\* algorithm. The 0 A.D. (another great opensource RTS game) provides some interesting documentation and strategies they use for their pathfinder: https://github.com/0ad/0ad/blob/master/docs/pathfinder.tex\n\nI made a complete refactor of the Pathfinder trait, based upon PR #7358. The goals of these changes are:\n- Isolate the dependencies (by extracting interfaces of classes like\n  Actor, Map and World) of the pathfinder trait and A\\* algorithm and\n  allow testability\n- Follow software engineering design patterns and best practices (SOLID\n  design principles) to create smaller, focused and isolated classes and\n  methods to allow to easily swap, create and benchmark different implementations\n  (through dependency injection), extend functionality and follow the SRP\n  principle and, of course, easier to read and understand.\n- Detect redundant calculations and unfitted data structures for several\n  problems\n- Ultimately, performance improvements\n\nIn detail, the changes introduced in this commit are the following:\n- The changes in PR #7358 (fragmented methods from the Expand algorithm,\n  fragmented the caching capabilities from the PathFinder class,\n  introduced interfaces to Actor, Map, and World classes, enabled unit\n  testability.\n- Fragmented the whole code which regards to pathfinding into several\n  files, placed inside its own folder \"Pathfinder\".\n- Improved the path cache (PathCacheStorage class) to work with a\n  Dictionary structure instead of a list for faster lookups and removals\n- Modified the CellLayer class to work with the Prototype design pattern,\n  and encapsulated this functionality in the class instead of making the\n  PathSearch class responsible for it.\n- Code which lookup up for \"PathFinder\" trait now looks for the\n  \"IPathFinder\" trait.\n- Extracted interface in the PriorityQueue class to be able to work with\n  both the former implementation or with a .Net SortedSet data structure.\n  Using one implementation or the other should be dependant on benchmarks\n  and use cases (Insertions in SorterSet are O(log n), removals and\n  Min lookups are O(1) while insertions in PriorityQueue are O(1) but Pops\n  are O(n log n)).\n- Extracted interface for the PathSearch class so we can provide different\n  implementations for the A\\* algorithm. 2 implementations for PathSearch\n  and Pathfinder are provided\n  currently: LegacyPathFinder and LegacyPathSearch (which contains the\n  same implementation as the former PathSearch class, only adapted to work\n  with interfaces, which has negligible penalty cost) and PathFinder and\n  PathSearch, which contains tweaked modifications of the A*, mobileinfo\n  and different data structures which are better fit with their usage.\n  This last implementation should be faster.\n- Provided more unit tests for benchmarking.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7430/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7429","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7429/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7429/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7429/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7429","id":56569163,"number":7429,"title":"Change
