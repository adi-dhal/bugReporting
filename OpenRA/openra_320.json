are tricky to efficiently render in GL, and our current renderer is hacky and relatively slow.\n\nWe may be able to win some perf by doing the initial voxel -> texture renderering on the CPU, using voxel.vpl for lighting.  This would give us a regular indexed sprite that we can render using the normal shp shader. \n\nWe would then save the FBO switch each frame plus any batch breakage from switching between the voxel
