They should not show up at the beginning of the game, ideally. To allow powerful units to show up in crates--without upsetting the balance--there should be a time delay feature for crates.\nIt could work like this:\n\n```\n    GiveMcvCrateAction@:\n        SelectionShares: 5\n                         TimeDelay: 600\n        NoBaseSelectionShares: 9001\n        Unit: mcv\n```\n\nThis would make it so that the MCV unit can only show up after 10 minutes of gameplay (600 s). This allows us to include a powerful unit in a crate--and even to give it good odds--but without risking throwing the game completely off at the beginning.\n\nIn CNC, mcv crates are currently disabled but I would love to re-enable them. \nD2K would also benefit from this time delay functionality.

Now it should be killable with an airstrike, which is about right. \n\nTo anyone paying attention: there has been some discussion over whether repairs should be cheaper. I am agnostic on the issue for now. How about we see if people like the repair bay more now and consider using it, before making further balance changes?
