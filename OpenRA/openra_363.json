This is so that if the target runs away, the tank can still hit. But if you are attacking a building, it doesn't make sense to get close, because the building does not move. I think that tanks should not go close to buildings, and should instead stay at maximum range. \n\nThis has a particular impact right now in D2K because the siege tank has +1 range than the missile tower, so it is supposed to defeat that building by staying out of. Instead, the siege tank goes close to the missile tower and enters its range, getting destroyed. It would be best if it didn't do this.\n\n-> This behavior of tanks going close to their target occurs when the tank uses AttackTurreted, but not AttackFrontal.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3257/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3256","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3256/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3256/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3256/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/3256","id":14208464,"number":3256,"title":"Removed

map loading (among other things) is a huge mess.\n\nSome of the specific failures that I'd like to see fixed are:\n- All maps are fully(?) initialized during loading, which contributes to the excessive load times.\n- Lobby faction choices derive from the shellmap.\n- Map previews aren't atlased, causing excessive batches in the map chooser.\n\nI have the following changes in mind:\n- Bump the map format version, and require maps to include a pre-rendered preview bitmap. Custom maps can ship a modified bitmap (e.g. the singleplayer missions can have a faction icon). Older maps will have their previews generated synchronously during game load (may regress load times for users with many custom maps). The bitmaps can also be used by other services, like the content website and quicklook on OSX.\n- Add a MapMetadata object which encodes the information (including faction choices) displayed in the map chooser and lobby.\n- Add a new MapLoader object on ModData for managing map metadata and atlasing previews into a sheet for rendering.\n- Avoid parsing the full map until it is actually needed to play a game.\n\n<bountysource-plugin>\n\n---\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Place a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/320647-refactor-map-loading?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3235/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3234","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3234/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3234/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3234/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/3234","id":14117005,"number":3234,"title":"Added support for Tiberian Sun MIX filename hashes","user":{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/5/labels","id":309128,"number":5,"title":"June 2013 Playtest","description":"Things that need testing first because they could jeopardize a stable release.","creator":{"login":"chrisforbes","id":128877,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/128877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisforbes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisforbes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":39,"state":"closed","created_at":"2013-04-12T10:01:43Z","updated_at":"2015-04-25T08:15:22Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2013-07-04T05:29:15Z"},"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-05-08T19:09:28Z","updated_at":"2014-06-14T07:35:18Z","closed_at":"2013-05-15T07:02:29Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/3234","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/3234","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/3234.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/3234.patch"},"body":"Implements #3227.
