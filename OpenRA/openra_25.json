I don't know what this issue is as I've checked multiple times (even checked the error logs, but I couldn't find anything?) and still crashes the game. Just hope this message helps to get it noticed and fixed. I know it's a Aftermath unit but still a good unit, but one crashes the game, that's a big deal. I'm starting to like this program It has really improved since older versions, as obviously running old RA95 on win7 or 10 just ain't gonna happen otherwise, and I like the Tiberian sun\\ RA2 style mechanics IE. flying rockets and projectiles, better resolution scaling + optimization for newer hardware & even still being able to install data from the old Cd's is great. So just I hope I'd might help out with this \"Fatal\" in-game bug I found. C:\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nB.

reworks our AutoTarget logic to add support for explicit target prioritization.\r\n\r\nSome potential future use cases:\r\n* Adding target prioritization to improve AI micromanagement, together with #13382.  E.g. \"Hard AI\" owned rocket troopers will attack tanks before infantry (see testcase commit).\r\n* Implementing the proper C&C stance logic, together with #13371.  Units in the AttackAnything stance autotarget non-defense structures, but units in the Defense stance don't.\r\n* Implementing the cut [threat rating node upgrade](http://cnc.wikia.com/wiki/Threat_Rating_Node_upgrade) in TS.\r\n\r\nPerformance-wise, i'm hoping this will roughly balance out -- we need to do a bit extra work per actor to query the target types, but actors that make use of the priorities win a lot by being able to skip actors of a lower priority before doing the weapon checks.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the haphazard spray of `AutoTarget` overrides across our default mod/map rules means that we can't implement a proper upgrade rule for this.  I took this opportunity to clean up our AutoTarget definitions across all four mods.\r\n\r\nThe [pchote/autotarget-types-testcase](https://github.com/pchote/OpenRA/commits/autotarget-types-testcase) branch has two throwaway testcases for the new behaviour:\r\n* Player controlled units will prioritize vehicles or tanks based on their damage type, illustrating the prioritization logic.\r\n* Iron curtained units will stop AutoTargeting everything, illustrating the condition support.\r\n\r\nCloses #3581.\r\nCloses #10625.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13383/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13382","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13382/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13382/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13382/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13382","id":231896351,"number":13382,"title":"Add bot type field and GrantConditionOnBotOwner","user":{"login":"pchote","id":167819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/167819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote","html_url":"https://github.com/pchote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/23/labels","id":2556950,"number":23,"title":"Next Release","description":"","creator":{"login":"reaperrr","id":2857877,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2857877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperrr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperrr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2,"closed_issues":231,"state":"open","created_at":"2017-06-01T19:00:24Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T20:57:42Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-05-28T21:36:34Z","updated_at":"2017-07-07T20:33:10Z","closed_at":"2017-07-07T20:31:46Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/13382","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13382","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13382.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/13382.patch"},"body":"Using the human-readable name as an internal identifier for bots is bad:\r\n* It makes parsing more difficult than necessary (may contain spaces and other special characters).\r\n* They break as soon as we want to translate them.\r\n\r\nThese are fixed by adding a new internal Type field that is used for client &lrarr; server orders and the `PlayerReference.Bot` field (which isn't used in any of our default maps).\r\n\r\nThis also adds a new `GrantConditionOnBotOwner` trait that... grants a condition on an actor while it is owned by a bot (big surprise).
