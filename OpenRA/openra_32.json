The system cannot find the file specified.\r\n\r\nI don't understand why it fails here but works for our main mod dlls.  The `monodis --assemblyref` references to OpenRA.Game and OpenRA.Mods.Common are the same for both.  In any case, keeping our `ResolveAssembly` override around until we dispose the ObjectCreator seems to fix the issue.\r\n\r\nTestcase:\r\n* Check out https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAModTemplate/tree/wip on Windows\r\n* Compile the engine and OpenRA.Mods.Example project\r\n* Run the mod using the `launch-game.cmd` script and watch it die\r\n* Change the submodule reference to point to this PR\r\n* Recompile\r\n* Run the mod using the `launch-game.cmd` script and watch it run\r\n\r\nBehaviour under mono should not change.\r\n\r\nI guess that this explains why third party mods have always insisted on / resorted to hacks to put their dll projects in the main code tree, but I don't understand why it hasn't been reported or seriously discussed as a legitimate engine bug before now.\r\n\r\nRequesting reviews from:\r\n* @RoosterDragon, @chrisforbes: You have the most experience in the technical aspects.\r\n* @GraionDilach, @reaperrr: You have the most experience in how this affects third party mods.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13190/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13189","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13189/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13189/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13189/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13189","id":223938957,"number":13189,"title":"Spectators can make the game lag by rapidly switching views","user":{"login":"MaLomm","id":13467449,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13467449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaLomm","html_url":"https://github.com/MaLomm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaLomm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaLomm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaLomm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaLomm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaLomm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaLomm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaLomm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaLomm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaLomm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382530,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Performance","name":"Performance","color":"02e10c","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-04-24T20:19:38Z","updated_at":"2017-05-07T11:03:35Z","closed_at":"2017-05-07T11:03:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi there,\r\n\r\nI found out that spectators can make the game lag by holding either 1 or 2 and thus switching through the views of the players.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13188","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13188/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13188/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13188/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/13188","id":223916951,"number":13188,"title":"Main screen is very choppy and laggy.
