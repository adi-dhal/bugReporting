loading/modchooser screen. When I launch the game, it crashes immediately without opening the main game window. To exclude possibility the crash has something to do with a specific mod to be loaded during the launch, I changed it to another in .openra/settings.yaml.\r\n \r\nI hardly can pinpoint the issue though the message is clear: \"Dll not found\" (soft_oal.dll), and indicates this has something to do with openal (?). I upgraded my OpenAL package version to 1.17.2 and re-compiled the game just to make sure this hasn't anything to do with too old openal package version on my system.\r\n \r\nI assume the issue affects only me. I didn't get the message on openSUSE, Windows or Ubuntu 16.04 LTS after successful compilations. This leads to my main question which is: What (packages, dll's, codelines...) should I look for to narrow down the issue on my system? Which things/packages/configuration should I re-check or upgrade to fix this? Does it have something to do with NuGet downloads during complation? (as you can assume: yes, I'm kinda lost here)\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated.

OpenRA occasionally crashes while playing multiplayer games for no apparent reason. First, the game completely freezes for all players, then after a couple of seconds I see the Windows 10 blue \"wait\" circle (http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=25890fba-fd6c-4700-a2eb-cca90d5142b9). After that the game either crashes and closes or it resumes. If it resumes it will say that I have a connection problem and the other players are usually angry at me. If it doesn't resume it crashes completely, says \"Openra has encountered a fatal error..etc\" and refers me to the Logs folder.\r\n\r\nI am on Windows 10. I did a fresh install of the OS just yesterday in an attempt to rule our any problem at the OS level or other applications interfering. So it is basically a clean OS with only some development tools like GIT and Maven installed. Nothing that should interfere with OpenRA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI inspected the Logs directory. There is no exception log there and the only logs that contain data are debug.log, perf.log and server.log. Debug.log and perf.log don't contain anything out of the ordinary. No errors or warning messages or stack trace. Server.log has only one line that reads \"Order lag is now 3 frames.\", but that line was written 9 minutes before the game crashed, so I don't think it is related.\r\n\r\nI guess my connection would be the primary suspect, but it is a 50mbit fiber connection that works fine in other applications I use, so I'd be surprised if that is the issue, but I cannot rule it out either.\r\n\r\nAny ideas here what could be wrong? I realize it is little to go by for analyzing a software problem. I am a developer myself. I was hoping to get something more useful from the logs...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12383/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12382","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12382/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12382/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12382/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12382","id":189198421,"number":12382,"title":"[idea] Add sprite rotation in RenderSprites trait.","user":{"login":"yaaaaa","id":11130958,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11130958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaaaaa","html_url":"https://github.com/yaaaaa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaaaaa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaaaaa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaaaaa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaaaaa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaaaaa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaaaaa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaaaaa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaaaaa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaaaaa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-11-14T19:12:40Z","updated_at":"2016-11-14T20:03:41Z","closed_at":"2016-11-14T20:03:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11130958/20279935/b7667a46-aad4-11e6-809d-65b170188989.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12382/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12381","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12381/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12381/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12381/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12381","id":188980998,"number":12381,"title":"Upgrades overhaul part 1: EnabledCondition","user":{"login":"pchote","id":167819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/167819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote","html_url":"https://github.com/pchote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":17,"created_at":"2016-11-13T16:58:49Z","updated_at":"2016-11-30T18:44:36Z","closed_at":"2016-11-30T18:42:35Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/12381","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12381","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12381.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12381.patch"},"body":"This is the second step towards #12380 (after #12378, which this depends on).\r\n\r\n`EnableCondition` is implemented in parallel to the old code for all of our upgrade consumers, assuming / forcing level 0 &rarr; false, level >= 1 &rarr; true.
