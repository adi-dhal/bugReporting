is a tracking bug for implementing the isometric heightmapped terrain used in TS and RA2.  This is the main prerequisite of our TS mod (#3363).\r\n\r\nRequirements (roughly in the order they will need to be completed):\r\n- [x] Introduce a new self-consistent 3d coordinate system. [#2887, #2917, #3433, #3434, #3531, #3583, #3586, #3592, #3861, #3886, #3887, #4371, plus probably others]\r\n- [x] Unhardcode the infantry sub-cells to support 3 instead of 5 and adapt the perspective [#6100]\r\n- [x] Add support for the tmp(TS) terrain tiles.\r\n  - [x] Update the terrain renderer to support additional sprite types. [#4185]\r\n  - [x] Add support for flat isometric tiles. [#4391]\r\n  - [x] Add support for loading embedded overlay artwork (cliffs, slopes). [#6855]\r\n  - [x] Add support for TS/RA2 style terrain variants. [#7757]\r\n  - [x] Support parsing the depth data as additional sprite frames. [#7968]\r\n- [x] Add support for orthographic (isometric) tile renderering.\r\n  - [x] Support rectangular tiles with perspective. [#4391]\r\n  - [x] Generalize the (currently hardcoded) relationship between cell and world coordinates.\r\n    [#5629, #5757, #5758]\r\n  - [x] Introduce isometric coordinate calculations. [#5778]\r\n- [x] Add support for heightmaps and slope tiles.\r\n  - [x] Extend Tileset format with fields for slope type and LAT relationships. [#6855]\r\n  - [x] Extend Map format with a heightmap block. [#6901]\r\n  - [x] Update cell -> world coordinate conversion to use the heightmap data. [#6901]\r\n- [x] Write a TS/RA2 tileset.ini converter [#6708].\r\n- [x] Write a new map editor that can render and place isometric tiles.

On Russian system it is 866, on Greek - 737 (as reported by #5261). On some system these \"OEM\" code pages are not installed and the game crashes.\n\nI think it's sufficient to use the default encoding for file names (as we hopefully don't store some non-ASCII
