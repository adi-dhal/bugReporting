static defence in TD is extremely powerful. This leads to more turtling, passive play styles, and overall boring games. The primary reason why static defence is this powerful I believe is because it's easy to get in a pinch and covers a pretty significant amount of space for relatively little cost, in particular compared to units. There's just not much of a drawback in investing in them, nor does it require a lot of thought into where you build them.\n\nI suggest the following changes to remedy this situation.\n\nGuard Tower\n- Reduce range from 6 to 5\n- Reduce vision from 7 to 6\n- Increase buildtime from 12s to 24s\n\nGun Turret\n- Reduce range from 6 to 5\n- Reduce vision from 7 to 6\n- Increased buildtime from 15s to 30s\n\nSAM Site\n- Reduce range from 10 to 7\n- Increase buildtime from 18s to 36s\n\nAdvanced Guard Tower\n- Reduce range from 8 to 6\n- Reduce vision from 9 to 7\n- Increase buildtime from 24s to 48s\n\nObelisk of Light\n- Reduce range from 8.5 to 6.5\n- Reduce vision from 8 to 7\n- Increase buildtime from 36s to 52s\n\nI've assembled a mod which includes these changes:\nhttps://mega.co.nz/#!VptRHJ5R!bZKC2PwLIwRZJ8ZojYGo5wrNQ7W_IBLSgW2fc_Bocas\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4722","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4722/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4722/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4722/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4722","id":28128463,"number":4722,"title":"Chat field does not have focus by default in game lobby","user":{"login":"deniz1a","id":6599106,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6599106?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a","html_url":"https://github.com/deniz1a","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deniz1a/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33149887,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Polish","name":"Polish","color":"FF9933","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-02-23T21:56:19Z","updated_at":"2014-07-24T20:40:47Z","closed_at":"2014-07-24T20:40:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is a minor issue.
