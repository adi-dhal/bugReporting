I'd like to get this in as it is fairly annoying that you can't upgrade without a Con Yard, even if you have the upgradable building, but this should be properly tested to see if any issues do exist (no one apparently remembers what the issues were...). From my testing I don't see anything immediately noticable.\n\nAlso check the missions to make sure all the available tech is correct, I tried updating them to keep it the same.\n\nThe reason the player is also given the building queue is because if it isn't the case then the upgrade tab gets shown to you when deploying your first MCV. This is because the queue appears to activate once the buildup is finished, while the prerequisite is activated immediately. This simply means all buildings should have the construction_yard as a prerequisite, which was already made the case. Just a note for anyone doing any mapping.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10025/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10024","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10024/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10024/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10024/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10024","id":117479233,"number":10024,"title":"Orcas

Unfortunately the EffectiveOwner check is enforced for both manual and automatic orders on the ResolveOrder side, so these manual orders are ignored.  The only way to make this work without rewriting the attack logic again is to force a force attack.\n\nOn the plus side, at least this approach is easy to review and doesn't risk regressions...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10017","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10017/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10017/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10017/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10017","id":117162335,"number":10017,"title":"Fix

on `bleed` have been \"fixed\". So, in order to detect them you have to use either dogs (only Soviets) or try to select them and if that doesn't work, you're sure it's a spy, which is super confusing (and then you have to force-fire them). \n\nI'm strongly against that new behaviour. Firstly, nobody complained about spies being detectable with cursors. Usually there's a lot of infantry on the map, so it takes a while to scan all of them with your cursor, which already is punishing (but totally fine). Secondly, it's already pretty hard to detect spies. They can disguise as anyone, so there are no common patterns like \"oh, I see a rifler, I know spies can only be riflers, so it's easy for me to select all riflers with the \"W\" key and check if it's my unit or a spy\". Thirdly, new players might not know about the ability to force fire.\n\nPlease, reconsider this behaviour. Ideally, I would like them not to be \"fixed\".\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10011","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10011/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10011/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10011/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10011","id":117006432,"number":10011,"title":"Better actor selection in game by actor bounds center","user":{"login":"atlimit8","id":4957137,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4957137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8","html_url":"https://github.com/atlimit8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":14,"created_at":"2015-11-15T17:32:44Z","updated_at":"2016-05-07T10:53:35Z","closed_at":"2015-12-25T18:17:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/10011","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10011","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10011.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/10011.patch"},"body":"Sibling to #9927.\nFixes #9998.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10011/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4863","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507246141","x-github-request-id":"ADCB:01FA:BB9FBA:1A6110F:59D6B443","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=138>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=405>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/959908/issues?state=all&page=136>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"b1910200185ba6a01af41718cf244f52\"","status":"200 OK"}}
