art in C&C/Dune games always uses north/up facing as first facing.\n\nHowever, there are games like MechCommander where the first facing in sprites is south/down, so they currently require some annoying work-arounds (using either `Frames:` or `Combine:` to re-order the frames).\n\nIt would be easier to have a simple boolean switch to handle this in a way that doesn't require manually
