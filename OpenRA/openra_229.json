Also unlike `AttackFollow.CanAttack()`, the base method has a `self.IsInWorld` check, which comes after the removed target validity check.\n- Exposed an Info field in the `DetectCloaked` trait in order to remove\n  `a.Actor.Info.Traits.Get<DetectCloakedInfo>();`\n  because `ActorsWithTrait<DetectCloaked>()` already gives us the needed trait and it is redundant to do another `Traits.Get<>()`\n- `TargetableUnit.TargetableBy()` shouldn't check if the actor is cloaked. `cloak.IsVisible()` does that.\n\nIn theory this should have a marginally positive effect on late-game performance. Other than that, mostly cleanup stuff.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7275","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7275/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7275/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7275/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7275","id":53350765,"number":7275,"title":"Formatted all files.","user":{"login":"RoosterDragon","id":3399086,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3399086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon","html_url":"https://github.com/RoosterDragon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoosterDragon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2015-01-04T22:16:29Z","updated_at":"2015-01-07T11:04:10Z","closed_at":"2015-01-07T10:56:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/7275","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7275","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7275.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7275.patch"},"body":"Figured since everything was just StyleCop'd - we might as well round things off and unify the formatting a bit.

Unfortunately, the bins were accessed directly in world coordinates which are on a scale 1024x greater than cell coordinates. This lead to all actors being placed into the bottom right bin. When checking for actors in a box, only this bottom right bin would be iterated for actors. Thanks to the fact this bin indeed contained all the actors, some clamps on the input ranges and filtering required per bin anyway, this actually returned correct results. Effectively, it was as if there was no spatial partitioning at all.\n\nNot surprisingly however, this is fairly inefficient. By correcting the spatial partitioning to actually partition we see a 7x speedup in ActorsInBox on the RA shellmap.\n\nI tested this programatically by having the results of this new method compared against those from just checking all the actors each time ActorsInBox was called. There were no differences whilst the RA shellmap was running.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7262/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7261","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7261/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7261/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7261/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7261","id":53314012,"number":7261,"title":"map.yaml cleanup","user":{"login":"abcdefg30","id":7704140,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7704140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30","html_url":"https://github.com/abcdefg30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abcdefg30/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":12,"created_at":"2015-01-03T20:10:30Z","updated_at":"2015-01-13T15:35:39Z","closed_at":"2015-01-12T21:05:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/7261","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7261","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7261.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7261.patch"},"body":"Split from #7164 as requested (https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7164#issuecomment-68462738).\n\nThis PR...\n- Removes unused waypoints\n- Renames actors that still have standart names (\"waypoint1\") to something more reasonable\n- Reorderes all named actors;
