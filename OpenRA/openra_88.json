I couldn't find anything conclusive about the legal status of TD/RA SHP compression algorithms (though any patents covering them should have expired by now), at least the RLE zeros compression used by SHP(TS) is too generic to be patented/copyrighted.\n\nTherefore, a possible approach might be to use the same compression(s) SHP(TS) uses and just use different file and frame headers.\nFor the file header, we could replace the always-zero uint16 at the start with some other value (or a string, maybe `ORASHP`).\nFor frame headers, compared to SHP(TS) we could simply throw out the (unused) 3-byte-align, the following uint32 RGBA radar color (not used by OpenRA), and the following uint32 (unused).\n\nThat way, it should be easy to add support for this format to OS SHP Builder and XCC Mixer (though at least some command-line encoder will be needed for platforms on which these don't run, of course).\nA minor additional benefit would be that total filesize would decrease by 11 bytes per frame due to the slimmed down frame header (which could save about 6 KB per TS infantry shp with e1 sequences, for example) as a little extra benefit.\n\nThis should avoid any hypothetical problems with the proprietary nature of Westwood-developed SHP formats.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11506/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11505","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11505/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11505/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11505/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11505","id":161735493,"number":11505,"title":"Engineer

This allows it to handle mobile actors far better. Only trading off somewhat questionable logic involving aligning the plane with the exit location.\n\nFixes the primary issue raised in #11503.\n\nEDIT: As pchote pointed out. The exit really needs to be taken into proper account instead of how it's handled here.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11503","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11503/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11503/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11503/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11503","id":161614713,"number":11503,"title":"ProductionParadrop issues","user":{"login":"Nelax","id":2549088,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2549088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nelax","html_url":"https://github.com/Nelax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nelax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nelax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nelax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nelax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nelax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nelax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nelax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nelax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nelax/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382400,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"d7e102","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-06-22T07:48:26Z","updated_at":"2016-06-22T09:51:52Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I just tried using this trait with a moving unit and even with a deployable version there would be issues.

if this is a double post, but I only found topics regarding the display resolution associated with the UI.
