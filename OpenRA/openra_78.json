gets us another step closer towards being able to enable the depth buffer rendering in the gen2 mods (nearly there!) by rendering voxels with an approximately correct z coordinate so that they are composited at (nearly) the right place in the world.\n\nThe \"approximately\" and \"(nearly)\" are because we throw away the per-pixel depth information associated with the model and for now can only render a flat billboard.  As commented in the code, this is because we have at most four colour channels to store 5 sets of data (RGB, alpha, and depth).  For now hacking the depth gives a good-enough result that we can improve further down the line when the voxel renderer is rewritten.\n\nYou'll notice when testing that the voxels clip beneath the ground when moving over slopes.  This isn't the renderer's fault: the heightmap-unaware movement code really is making the actors move partially underground, in addition to not being able to rotate them to match the slope.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11791/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11790","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11790/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11790/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11790/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11790","id":170112334,"number":11790,"title":"Include

code for moving units through cells independently lerps actor positions along disjoint straight-lines between cell edges while smoothly varying the facing.  This leads to subtly wrong-looking moves when units turn corners (actors move in a different direction to their facing).\n\nThe effect is small, but extremely irritating when you know what to look for... or even when you don't: this is the main cause of the often-repeated \"OpenRA's turning is too smooth\" complaint.\n\nThis PR replaces the linear position lerping with arcs.  It still ignores the unit's ROT because incorporating that would (a) be much more complicated and (b) break balance (fast units wouldn't be able to turn sharply enough to move without stopping).\n\nBefore and after videos:\n- [before](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qp5u64egxgsdb5h/before.mov?dl=0)\n- [after](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ziio8vbzldgwnn2/after.mov?dl=0)\n\nFixes #11212.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11788/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11787","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11787/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11787/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11787/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11787","id":169807579,"number":11787,"title":"Added the Tiberian Sun: Firestorm assets","user":{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":16,"created_at":"2016-08-07T17:50:15Z","updated_at":"2016-09-26T19:25:06Z","closed_at":"2016-09-26T19:25:06Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/11787","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11787","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11787.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11787.patch"},"body":"Depends on:\n- [ ] ~~https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAWeb/pull/307~~\n- [x] https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11771\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11787/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11786","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11786/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11786/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/11786/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11786","id":169801395,"number":11786,"title":"Fixed renderer not getting disposed.","user":{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-08-07T15:26:07Z","updated_at":"2016-08-08T15:43:39Z","closed_at":"2016-08-08T15:42:22Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/11786","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11786","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11786.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11786.patch"},"body":"This was detected by Coverity.
