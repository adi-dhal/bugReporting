That is, on current release you can press \"E\" while producing a building, which will trigger an infinite \"switch tab\" sound and as soon as your building is ready, you will be able to put it on the map. I have recorded this technique recently, so the video illustrates what I am talking about (mind the timestamp): https://youtu.be/P0fj_h_JxD4?t=2m48s \n\nWas it intentional?
