is most noticable with the cruiser.\n\nWhen for example the cruiser is facing down/south, and the turrets facing and shooting south-west (the cruisers on the temperate shellmap are a good example), the muzzle flashes of the turret on the back of the ship are not only drawn below the turret, but even below the ships' body.\n\nIn my opinion the muzzle should only be drawn below the turret shp if the turret is facing \"away\" from the viewer (i.e. north, north-west, north-east and so on), and should generally never be drawn below the body if the unit has a turret, as a turret is normally meant

brightness of snow a little, gives more contrast to darker patches.\n\nThere recently was a complaint somewhere (forgot where it was) that the snow of the cnc mod is too bright. This was likely a result of the conversion, since C&C and RA use different palettes.\n\nI figured the easiest way to fix this was editing snow.pal. The C&C snow terrain mostly uses color 239 for regular snow and color 192 for darker patches, so I reduced the brightness of color 239 by two steps, and decreased the brightness of color 192 by 4 steps (except for the blue value, which got decreased by only 1 step).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3663/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3662","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3662/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3662/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3662/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/3662","id":17896900,"number":3662,"title":"Cleanup
