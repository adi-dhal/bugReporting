As shown in this commit, one might easily forget to update the copying constructor with recently added fields (for example, TimestampFormat was not copied before this commit).\n\nThe more general solution (for simple cases like this one) is a call to a protected System.Object method MemberwiseClone(), which does exactly what its name says.\n\nActually, you may consider using a struct for cases like this. Structs are always copied on assignment; it takes a lot of trickery to actually modify (not replace) someone else's struct, and it is virtually impossible if it is published via a readonly property. But, since structs are all ValueTypes (which implies they are allocated on stack), it is not recommended to use them without fully understanding their nature.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9937/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9936","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9936/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9936/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/9936/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9936","id":115766698,"number":9936,"title":"AI
