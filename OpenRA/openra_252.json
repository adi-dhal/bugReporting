This also limits the maximum number of bots that will be used in the map. For example, to use no bots specify `Launch.Developer.Bots=\"\"`\n\nA reasonable default is selected for each `Launch.Developer.*` argument. if `Launch.Developer=true` is not present, then OpenRA will start normally.\n\nAn example launch is as follows:\n\n```\nOpenRA.Game.exe \\\n  Launch.Developer=true \\\n  Launch.Developer.Map=texas-sea \\\n  Launch.Developer.Cheats=\"DevShroudDisable, DevFastBuild\" \\\n  Launch.Developer.Bots=\"Rush AI, Turtle AI\"\n```\n\nThis will launch a game directly into the texas-sea map with the shroud disabled and fast build enabled.
