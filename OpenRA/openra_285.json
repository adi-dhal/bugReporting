of all, thank you for recreating the game i loved a decade ago :)\n\nThere seems to be a problem with units getting stuck causing lag. When i play this with a friend, the game sometimes gets really slow. I usually ask if the other party has some units stuck, and when he moves them, the games runs normal again. \n\nIt is a minor inconvenience, and easily fixed by moving units. However i of course can't ask the AI the same question, which is why the games almost halts when i play against AI. \n\nUnits are stuck when you give them an order to move, but other units or buildings block are in the way. It seems that the unit won't stop trying to get out.\n\nThe task manager usually shows that OpenRA is using about 10% of the CPU. When a few units get stuck, then the CPU uses weirdly drops to below 5%. It is actually using less CPU.\n\nI think this problem could be fixed if the behavior of units is changed or if the order is canceled after X amount of time when there is no way to get to the destination. \n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on

the flame-trooper as a template to create the sniper unit, the \"standing\" firing frames were never created for the sniper unit since it was established that the sniper would always \"prone\" fire. Now, this isn't the case, as the Sniper unit fires standing up, but the standing firing frames need to be added. \n\nAlso, the sniper unit currently uses GenericVoice, maybe it would be a good idea to distinguish selecting/ordering a sniper unit with a different voice than that of the typical e1,e3, etc.\n\nEdit: Firing frames are added, also added in some \"reloading\" frames for the sniper in between shots.\n\n![comparison](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1801219/3210144/7b21b3b8-eea5-11e3-8a6b-ed6c7211d930.png)\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a

This commit shows primary tag on production buildings always if it is set, not only when the building is selected. Airfield has a separate tag position because of overlapping of progress bars.

I couldn't have done this commit without the help of WolfGaming in #openra.
