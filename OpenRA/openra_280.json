A player with a really simple base (refinery+infantry) couldn't capture nuke silos or helipads for example.\n\n **Usefulness**\n- your pal loses his refinery... you can give him one of yours.\n- sometimes, during a battle, when you lose many important buildings (after a nuke attack), it takes a long time for you to re-create your base. With this feature, a player could retrieve a missing building for his base (as long as he has an engineer on the field).\n- you are low money... but you have an engineer idling outside. With this feature, you could capture one of your team-mate's silos and get some of the money it contains.\n- you could capture your pal's power-plants too (useful if you are low on energy).\n- you could \"share\" oil derricks...\n\nTeam-mates are in the same team after all, to me, the goal is to help each other too.
