It allows your selected units not only to stay in formation, but also to adjust the speed of the group to the slowest unit in the group. I think it was a great addition to the oldschool red alert which unlocked cool new strategies.

Not sure of anything particular causing it, but I've noticed it at least since the 20161015 version. It occurs after playing very long matches (what can I say, I'm a turtle) with perhaps rather large numbers of units, which I'm guessing is no coincidence based on the \"out of memory\".\r\n\r\nI noticed in this specific match that the game was lagging, and that some of the opponents had a remarkable number of units. So I took to nuking them, and it seemed like the lagging was getting better, but then the game crashed shortly after. So it can't be a matter of too many units at once.\r\n\r\nIs this a problem that can be fixed, or do I need to finish my games faster?\r\n\r\n```\r\nRed Alert Mod at Version release-20161019\r\non map
