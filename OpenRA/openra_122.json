I spawn a bunch of crates and do not store them in a variable. Then I use `Map.ActorsInBox` to destroy some actors including these spawned crates. My simplified function:\n\n``` lua\nfunction ClearMap()\n  local unitsToDestroy =\n    Map.ActorsInBox(Map.TopLeft,Map.BottomRight, function(actor)\n      return IsHusk(actor) or actor.Owner ~= neutral or actor.HasProperty('Crate')\n    end)\n\n  Utils.Do(unitsToDestroy, function(actor)\n   -- destroy...\n  end)\nend\n```\n\nAs you can see the `actor.HasProperty('Crate')` part is not going to work because there's no such property.
