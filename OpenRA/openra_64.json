This shall not replace something here. It's more about filling the gabs. \nI'm aware that my suggestion is rly amazing complex and it has to grow slowly to cover all the basic needs (Timers, Counters,.), but it would significantly lower the entry barrier to \"maps with logic\".\nIn my opinion it would be nice to see an average mapper being able to create maps with logic.\nIt also could boost the recreation of the singleplayer campaigns for example. \nThink about it, why aren't they done yet? A big problem is that only a few mapers understand the basics of Lua scripting. The singleplayer campaigns are the ideal testcase for such a map tool.\n\nYou can imagine that logic tool like that of SC1.

Kazu sent about 20 spies into Christian's base, Christian was being attacked from two fronts and had 45 APM in an hour long game, so he didn't notice, he then continually sent spies into Christian's power plants, low power is such a set-back, also, this was an FFA on a large map, so Christian was floating around 30k, had Kazu sent the spies into the refinery he could have literally stolen the entirety of Christian's cash with a single click, it seems fair that a player can be punished for floating so much cash, but all players were floating in this game, and such severe punishment seems unjust.\n\nWhen you're concentrating on micro managing your units spotting a spy can be so difficult, this applies to a game of any size, whether team or 1v1 IMO.\n\nThere is also the possibility of \"spy locking\", chrono over an MCV, put a spy on hold at 1 second with 6 barracks, then build the 7th at your enemys base and spy the power, refinery, or pretty much anything you like, this is practically impossible to stop, because once you are in low power, or 30k has been reduced to 3,750 by 3 spies, you can't build any units to counter. I have watched this happen on several occasions, and experienced it myself on at least one memorable occasion on Sidestep, I had control of `literally every expansion`, I had a 15+ APM lead on the player I was playing against (and I don't waste actions) and a spy lock lost me the game.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12227","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12227/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12227/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12227/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12227","id":183184202,"number":12227,"title":"Defeated players in an FFA can pause the game","user":{"login":"AMHOL","id":1582784,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1582784?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AMHOL","html_url":"https://github.com/AMHOL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AMHOL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AMHOL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AMHOL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AMHOL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AMHOL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AMHOL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AMHOL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AMHOL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AMHOL/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382400,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"d7e102","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-10-15T02:40:41Z","updated_at":"2017-05-10T13:00:51Z","closed_at":"2017-05-10T13:00:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"As with #12226, I'm not sure whether this applies exclusively to defeated players or whether specs can do this too, but earlier I lost in an FFA and accidentally paused the game.

created, create a button that adds it automatically (but when the lua is empty, delete it again)\n- [ ] Add a window for the map's lua (if created, with save button)\n  - [ ] Add a small window of Information about the current unit you are hovering over\n  - [ ] Change owner\n  - [ ] Change name\n  - [ ] Change health #10818\n- [ ] Save & play the map directly from editor\n  - [ ]   Add the

Description\n\nI get pretty persistent game crashes when the window loses focus, sometimes the Window can lose focus without issue, it seems to occur most frequently (if not exclusively) when focus is lost whilst interacting with the game, for example if I accidentally hit the volume key or Windows key whilst trying to micro.\n\nWhen it happens killing the process with `sudo kill -9` doesn't close the game window, it just kills the music, I can still open the window and see the frozen game, however the cursor doesn't change as normal and I can't interact with it at all.

Was there any logic in the original game to stave off the attack of nearby units to a building that's currently under capture by an (allied) engineer? If I start a building capture, but my invading force is too strong, I lose out on the ability to take buildings pretty quickly. At least if they don't automatically become aggressive against buildings that are already in capture progress, the game's macro makes sense.... obviously different if I choose to attack the building with direct orders.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12202","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12202/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12202/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12202/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12202","id":182124686,"number":12202,"title":"D2k arrakis.yaml tilesets mixed up","user":{"login":"CH4Code","id":16046997,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16046997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CH4Code","html_url":"https://github.com/CH4Code","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CH4Code/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CH4Code/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CH4Code/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CH4Code/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CH4Code/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CH4Code/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CH4Code/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CH4Code/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CH4Code/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382400,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"d7e102","default":false},{"id":21104921,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Dune%202000","name":"Dune 2000","color":"EDC9AF","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2016-10-10T21:55:32Z","updated_at":"2017-03-18T12:58:13Z","closed_at":"2017-03-18T12:58:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Bug description and Fix suggestion.\n\nIn an attempt to use OpenRA.Utilities.exe to import mission A1V1 i noticed some misplaced tiles.\nUsing the correct tileset for this map `BLOXTREE.R8` (phrase \"BLOXTREE\" found in a original D2k .Sav file of the mission) only some of the misplaced tiles were correct now.\n\nI compared in the map editor with original game \"screenshots\" and found:\nRock-Detail 94 should be Rotten-Base 251\nRotten Base 250 and 251 together should be Sand-Detail 117\n\nIn `arrakis.yaml` (tileset file of d2k) i found the corresponding entries under `ID:94, ID:250, ID:251`\nReplacing`Images: BLOXBASE.R8` with `Images: BLOXTREE.R8` fixed the issue.
