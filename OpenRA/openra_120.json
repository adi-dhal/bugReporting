These hashes were included as a workaround for the mix format not storing filenames.  We now instead require that all mix files have corresponding mix database entries (true for all default mixes as well as any custom mixes with valid local mix database.  This will break any mods that intentionally write corrupted mix databases as \"copy protection\").\n\nTested that TD/RA/TS still run, and that they can still be installed from CD (however note #10529).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10530/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10529","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10529/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10529/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10529/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/10529","id":127018909,"number":10529,"title":"Installing from CD does not work","user":{"login":"pchote","id":167819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/167819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote","html_url":"https://github.com/pchote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":95766782,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Easy","name":"Easy","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":117791539,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Regression","name":"Regression","color":"e11d21","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/17","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestone/17","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/17/labels","id":1372708,"number":17,"title":"release-20160508","description":"","creator":{"login":"atlimit8","id":4957137,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4957137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8","html_url":"https://github.com/atlimit8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atlimit8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":154,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-10-23T15:44:13Z","updated_at":"2016-12-24T14:29:58Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2016-05-09T19:42:46Z"},"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-01-16T11:40:37Z","updated_at":"2016-01-21T18:58:09Z","closed_at":"2016-01-21T18:58:04Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"The installer creates the /Content directory, but not the Content/mod subdir.

It could be used to implement StarCraft-style shields, by giving an actor two `HitPoint`s of which one gets a higher priority (targeted/damaged first as long as it's not 'destroyed'), while the other would get `ImportanceType: Critical` (`Critical` = actor dies when this point is destroyed, `Important` = actor dies when all points with this importance are destroyed, `Insignificant/Redundant` = destroying this only disables something or makes other hit points vulnerable, but has no other effect) and only if the `HP` of the latter are reduced to 0 will the actor be killed.\nOf course, the trait should be upgradable, as well as able to provide upgrades.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on
