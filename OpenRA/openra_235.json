has been bugging me for a long time now, so I finally decided to address it.\n@Phrohdoh mentioned a few days ago on IRC that he wants to do some work on refineries, so if this is conflicting with his work we'll just close it for later (if needed), since it's not a feature or a bug fix.\nBasically what I did:\n- Rename TiberiumRefinery -> TiberiumDawnRefinery (only Tiberian Dawn mod uses it)\n- Rename HarvesterDockSequence -> TDHarvesterDockSequence (same reason)\n- Rename OreRefinery -> Refinery  (since both RA and Dune 2000 mods uses it)\n- Rename RAHarvesterDockSequence -> HarvesterDockSequence  (same reason)\n- Fixed a typo in RefineryInfo's DockAngle's

HardwarePalettes.ApplyModifiers, we achieve a 2x speedup (reducing overall time spent in this method from 4.3% to 2.2%) by block copying the palettes.\n\nSince palettes are internally implemented as arrays, a CopyToArray method has been added to allow palettes to be block copied. This makes copy operations 10x faster, meaning they now consume only 0.2% of overall time instead of 2.2%.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7091/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7090","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7090/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7090/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7090/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7090","id":51221337,"number":7090,"title":"Fixed infantry without idle animation never returning to stand","user":{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-12-07T15:40:40Z","updated_at":"2014-12-10T17:41:49Z","closed_at":"2014-12-09T19:08:10Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/7090","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7090","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7090.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7090.patch"},"body":"leaving it into a firing state.

Your units cross/come over the bridge and you have a small Soviet base to clear out, naval yard to cap(I think) and then move on.\n- clear out soldiers and flame towers\n- then order one of your tanks to start shooting at or get him within shooting of any building\n- change stance to HoldFire\n- yet the tank keeps on shooting\n- move tank away from the building - you can tell he keeps on tracking his target\n- move tank back close to the building, resp. withing firing range - firing resumes even though unit is in HoldFire stance\n- unless of course stance is changed by moving unit around. Which probably isn't true, because cycling stance for given unit cycles stances in expected and continuous order where we left off\n- once the building is capped, target is released\n\n**EDIT:** actually being within shooting range is enough to trigger this. It also can be reproduced by placing target on the ground/map via CTRL.

Use either MiG or Yak that's in flight \n2a. Ctrl + Right click on ground really close\\* to where the aircraft is flying\n2b. Right click on enemy unit that is really close to where the aircraft is flying\n*Doesn't have to be the same grid, inside the aircraft's turning raidus seems to be enough.\n\nBoth 2a and 2b can be used to reproduce the bug. Expected behavior would be that the aircraft enters an attack run pattern directly, which it does after successfully firing otherwise.  \n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/6829621-aircraft-fly-endlessly-in-a-circle-when-ordered-to-attack-inside-own-turning-radius?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F36085&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7083/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7082","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7082/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7082/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7082/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7082","id":51194656,"number":7082,"title":"Path moving and patrolling idea","user":{"login":"TSnake41","id":8642647,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8642647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSnake41","html_url":"https://github.com/TSnake41","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSnake41/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSnake41/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSnake41/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSnake41/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSnake41/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSnake41/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSnake41/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSnake41/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TSnake41/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382420,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Idea/Wishlist","name":"Idea/Wishlist","color":"e102d8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-12-06T20:22:16Z","updated_at":"2014-12-07T09:51:17Z","closed_at":"2014-12-07T09:51:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It would be nice to be adding a displacement system on the road and also for patrolling units much like RA2.

CellRegion and CellLayer classes prefer map-coords internally since they can be used more directly for array indexing, but their APIs all expose cell co-ordinates.\n\nThe lead to a particularly bad case where enumerating the cells of a region would do map->cell conversions for you, only to use those cells as an indexer into a layer which would convert the cell back into a map co-ordinate. All the round trips are quite expensive since so many are performed.\n\nThis PR adds the ability to enumerate a region in map-coords and then uses this ability in several key places to index into the layer using those map-coords. I didn't fix every use since there's so many.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7071/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7070","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7070/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7070/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7070/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7070","id":51100278,"number":7070,"title":"Rename
