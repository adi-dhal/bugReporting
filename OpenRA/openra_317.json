I'm very pleased with the results, see screenies below.\nIt's also more realistic. I tend do imagine snow or grass around a building is not totally \"untouched\" when operating people get in and out, especially in a military base.\n\nThe minibib does not take an additional cell below the building like the normal bib, it only acts as background arround the sprite.\n\nI aimed for the best compromise between visual looks and fitting em to the cell-structure, so the player always gets a feel for the cell squares, even with buildings that are rotated by several degrees.\nSo it also serves gameplay.\n\nWill ad more randomly selectable bibs in the future for the 1x1 bibs, so each building's dirt pile is unique!\n\nCode-wise, I decided against adding an unnecessary additional \"minibib\"-trait, but to use the already existing code for the bib with only minimal changes (to check if it has the \"minibib\"-sequence in the yaml-file). I think this is the cleanest approach.\n\nChanged some offset-values in sequences\\structures.yaml to make some minibibs look better.\nAlso fixed the service depot-footprint and offset it a bit, so it looks good and finally has its xxx, xxx footprint which you would expect.\n\nMinibib does not look good on walls by principle, on sam (needs a special bib which i will commit some time in the future) and camo pillbox (interferes with camo transparency), so these buildings are an exeption.\n\nAlso, since it is looking so much better, i changed Radar dome & tech center's bib to minibibs.\nYou almost always have only one of these buildings, so this will not affect gameplay in any way.\n\nIn the make:\nSame for CnC-mod.\n\nScreenshots:\n![temperat](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1968396/2148252/645bb648-93e1-11e3-85a6-b5f45ac3b62f.PNG)\n![snow](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1968396/2148257/77fcd984-93e1-11e3-86e7-62a45886b71b.PNG)\n![desert](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1968396/2148260/8414821c-93e1-11e3-957b-ff5de74a7acd.PNG)\n![interior](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1968396/2148265/98b6d486-93e1-11e3-9df0-0741195beae7.PNG)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4636","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4636/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4636/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4636/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/4636","id":27413900,"number":4636,"title":"Automatically upgrade outdated custom map rules","user":{"login":"pchote","id":167819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/167819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote","html_url":"https://github.com/pchote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6382407,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"02d7e1","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"pchote","id":167819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/167819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote","html_url":"https://github.com/pchote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"pchote","id":167819,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/167819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote","html_url":"https://github.com/pchote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pchote/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-02-12T07:00:24Z","updated_at":"2015-02-24T19:43:49Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"This would fix a lot of crashes.\n- Add a RulesVersion key to map.yaml (just a date, without release/playtest).\n- Have the map parser check this at startup and:\n  -

Higher resolutions with small sprite sizes exacerbate this problem. It is especially problematic for helicopters when attacking rocket soldiers.\n\nThis behaviour could be improved if the attack cursor was shown when over any part of a cell containing enemy infantry. It the cell contains more than one infantry unit, the attack order should be aimed at the infantry unit nearest the mouse position.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a
