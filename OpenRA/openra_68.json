At max range there's a lower probability of killing an idle Hind with 1 burst. \n- In a wolf pack Missile Subs does pretty well against idling groups of YAKs/MiGs albeit with unpredictable damage results.\n\nQuoting comments https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/commit/86ad7576cefa51e7fcb1042af546b703bed2b002\n\nThis commit brings with it the altered Speed + Angle proposed in the predecessing balance PR #12040 for the primary armament. Originally it was altered to address visually the AA capability of the projectile:bullet but it also had the side effect of being more visually pleasing compared to the very high altitude path of the projectile. With no objections I'd like to bring it along with the next Missile Sub PR.\n\nTurnspeed reduction (2 from 3) addressing targeting behavior vs idling YAKs/MiGs. The unit dances a bit when trying to face these particular targets in-between shots. Issue mostly visual. This is the case regardless of what AA projectile is assigned to the unit. Although YAKs/MiGs are poor targets for the SubMissileAA it still ought to look decent since players will do this anyway from time to time.\n\nIf possible, a solution would be for trait like https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Traits#attackfrontal to allow the SubMissileAA weapon to fire from ca. 20-30 degrees off it's front facing the target, and retain the normal SubMissiles requirement of having the unit directly facing the target. As per discussion with @chrisforbes  this is something that might require a bit of extra code work. This is a fix beyond my reach so I'm currently submitting this PR as-is with the (less than satisfactory) turnspeed reduction.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12105","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12105/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12105/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12105/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12105","id":179103499,"number":12105,"title":"[TS/RA2] Some Ideas about bridges...","user":{"login":"LipkeGu","id":2057932,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2057932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LipkeGu","html_url":"https://github.com/LipkeGu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LipkeGu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LipkeGu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LipkeGu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LipkeGu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LipkeGu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LipkeGu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LipkeGu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LipkeGu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LipkeGu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":21103452,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Balancing","name":"Balancing","color":"DDDDDD","default":false},{"id":6382420,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Idea/Wishlist","name":"Idea/Wishlist","color":"e102d8","default":false},{"id":41025558,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/Tiberian%20Sun","name":"Tiberian Sun","color":"eb6420","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-09-25T19:21:16Z","updated_at":"2017-09-17T08:05:56Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"- Low Bridges could be reduce the speed of a unit.

When the \"return to base\" hotkey is used all aircraft will return to base, but only those that can be resupplied will land on helipads.  This avoids the annoying dance (particularly in TD, where helipads are only used for repairing) where loaded/repaired helicopters will touch-and-go on the pad, wasting time that could be used resupplying those that actually need it.\n2.  @e1d1s1 has been arguing (#11979, #11982) that aircraft continuing their attacks after resupplying is a gameplay regression, and i'm now inclined to agree.

playtest-20160904\n\nHello all, I keep crashing with this error and have some information about it.\n\nException of type `System.OverflowException`: Negating the minimum value of a twos complement number is invalid.\n\nI have seen something about this error before but can only find a cached page on Google asking someone for a replay, \n\nI am seeing this error a lot and can produce multiple log file sets and replays if required.  We play large custom maps (normally 256x256) with modified rules to make games challenging and longer and work well on very large maps.  We spend much time working out how to make big MP maps run faster by carefully tweaking rules and map layout.  We archive all of our games' log files and replays by default and create our own maps.  We have a number of games producing this error which is becoming troublesome.\n\nI think this problem is related specially to Allied AA guns firing.  It seems to connected to the instant a new gun is built and happens more regularly when the gun is near the edge of the map (and the target aircraft is off the map) although it can also happen when the gun is anywhere.\n\nAfter looking at a number of exception call stacks, I am suspicious that before the turret is \"fully built\", some angle values between the turret and the target aircraft pass an invalid value to System.Math.AbsHelper() when calculating the inverse tangent between the 2 sets of coordinates to check whether the gun's yaw matches the target bearing.  In short, it seems to depend where the target aircraft when the gun is built.\n\nI can't say that I am right about the AA gun theory, but there is some evidence of this.\n\nThis particular game was suffering poor performance patches due to the pathfinder not liking units on a long thin bridge, we were in the process of producing this on demand and ending it again by taking them out!  I don't think performance is linked to this crash, I just wanted to explain the timings in perf.log.\n\n[Logs.zip](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/files/491514/Logs.zip)\n\nKeep up the good work.\n\nJames\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12100","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12100/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12100/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12100/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12100","id":179070622,"number":12100,"title":"Updated Mono to version 4.6.0","user":{"login":"Mailaender","id":756669,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/756669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender","html_url":"https://github.com/Mailaender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mailaender/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118143255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/labels/PR:%20Needs%20+2","name":"PR: Needs +2","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-09-25T06:03:46Z","updated_at":"2016-09-25T14:17:51Z","closed_at":"2016-09-25T14:17:51Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulls/12100","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12100","diff_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12100.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12100.patch"},"body":"Compiles and runs fine in my tests.
