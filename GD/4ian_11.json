is a PR that adds support for the OpenSUSE Build Service (sorry the big amount of commits compared to the real changes, had some problems with Travis CI so have to push to test).\n\nDetailed changed : \n- Disabled RPATH on Linux (strictly forbidden in rpms, only activated with building tests so as they can find GD's libs on Travis-CI)\n- Allow GDevelop to compile with the wxWidgets versions using std containers (on OpenSUSE for example).\n- Put linux specific files in /Binaries/Packaging/linux-extra-files (and add their installation in IDE/CMakeLists.txt)\n- Fix gdevelop.desktop which has some problems (invalid version, icon with a path), recreated the linux icon in a svg, icons installed in /usr/share/icons/hicolor (both scalable and fixed png for all main sizes).\n- Add a MIME type for GDevelop's projects (and an associated icon) to open project by simply double-clicking on them (and gdevelop.sh and StartGDevelop.sh give their first arg to GDIDE).\n- Add .spec to build RPM (Fedora 21, OpenSUSE 13.2, OpenSUSE Tumbleweed), and PKGBUILD to build pkg (for Arch Linux)\n- Script to prepare GDevelop in order to send it on OBS (interative script which asks GD version, package revision, branch to use and the changelog). After its execution, the files are available in /Binaries/Packaging/opensuse-build-service/final/. _(You need m4 installed to use it)_\n- call find_package(wxWidgets) in ExtLibs in order to use the correct wx-config (and force wx-config-3.0 to be used for Fedora as wx-config doesn't exists)\n\nWhat needs to be done : \n- Test if built debs are still valid\n- Add a post install, post remove and post upgrade script to update the mime database and the icon cache for the deb (already done for the spec and pkgbuild files)\n- Find a better way to avoid SFML installation (currently, the build scripts removes the SFML libs after make install)\n\nIf you have some questions or suggestions.
