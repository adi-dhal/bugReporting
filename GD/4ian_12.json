sprite object editor doesn't have any of those buttons. It may be useful if you wants to cancel all the changes you've made. Also, it avoids GD to rely on the dialog close button (that's causing troubles on Gnome 3 because modal dialogs are fixed and without close buttons).\nIf a \"Cancel\" button is added, it means the editor will have to copy the data before changing it (currently, it directly changes the data on the sprite).\n\n![capture d ecran de 2014-10-14 20 46 31](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/964512/4634675/7a413e36-53d2-11e4-9b1d-3855b21a525f.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/43/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/42","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/42/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/42/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/42/events","html_url":"https://github.com/4ian/GD/issues/42","id":45741077,"number":42,"title":"Action to open a web page","user":{"login":"4ian","id":1280130,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1280130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/4ian","html_url":"https://github.com/4ian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4ian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4ian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4ian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4ian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4ian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4ian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4ian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4ian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4ian/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110421964,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-10-14T11:52:54Z","updated_at":"2014-10-14T21:11:31Z","closed_at":"2014-10-14T21:11:31Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"There should be an action to open a web page.\nFor HTML5 games, the action should trigger the opening of a new tab (using `window`).\nFor native games, the action should use the system standard way of opening links (a call to `system()` with `start` for Windows or `xdg-open` for Linux, as already done in another action (can't remember its name).
