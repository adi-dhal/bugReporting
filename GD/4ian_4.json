fixes a bug when multiple scenes are linking to the scenes events.\nDuring code generation, events can be modified, for example to include links or to erase the type of conditions/actions that are not valid (when using an non existing object for example). \nFor the Javascript platform, when generating code for a scene, the same events were used for generating the code of the next scene.\nIf both scene were using the same events, and that code generation made changes to the events for the first one (for example, to remove an action due to a missing object), the second scene would also be impacted by the change (for example, the action for the object won't be generated).\n\nI stumbled on this bug while using two scenes with the same events, but not the same objects.\nWith the fix, events are copied so we are sure that code generation is not modifying them, as one could expect when using the code generation functions.\n\ncc @victorlevasseur For your interest

Should I post issues here instead?\n\nSometimes GD just segfaults and that is near impossible to track down. But sometimes I get a more meaningful crash report in terminal.
