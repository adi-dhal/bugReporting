content : \n- `gd::PlatformExtension::AddObject` is now a template method (of argument `T`, the object's class we want to declare). It does not take a function pointer as last argument anymore. The template argument is used to create a lambda that replaces the old `CreateXXXObject(gd::String name)` function pointer\n- `ExtensionBase::AddRuntimeObject` is now a templace method (of arguments `T`, the gd::Object derivative, and `U`, the runtime object's class we want to declare). The function pointer argument was removed too as the function pointer is generated by the method itself with a lambda. The lambda is a bit more complicated than the old `CreateXXXRuntimeObject(RuntimeScene&, const gd::Object&)` as, thanks to `T`, it does a `dynamic_cast` on the `gd::Object` before passing it to the runtime object's constructor. This allows the runtime objects constructors to get directly the correctly typed `gd::Object` inherited class (and it handles the `bad_cast` exception).\n\nIf you agree with the current implementation, I'll add another commit to update the doc.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/245/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/244","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/244/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/244/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/244/events","html_url":"https://github.com/4ian/GD/pull/244","id":129186657,"number":244,"title":"Fix
