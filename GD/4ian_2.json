is an experimental IDE for GDevelop that I've been working on lately.\r\nIt's still pretty raw but the scene editor is usable.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1280130/23775899/5feb6284-052b-11e7-91d2-5c22f785847b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Technologies\r\n\r\nThis new IDE (located in `newIDE` directory) is written in Javascript, based on React.js, using material-ui for the user interface and Electron for packaging and running it.\r\nAs it's full Javascript, GDevelop core is compiled from C++ to Javascript with Emscripten (see [GDevelop.js](https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop.js/tree/incoming)) so that the new IDE can manipulate GDevelop games.\r\n\r\nThe current IDE acts as a server and is launching the new IDE and serving it the game, and the new IDE can also send back any changes.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nThe idea is that the C++/wxWidgets based IDE is getting old and something new, fresh and Javascript based can be easier to maintain, extend and improve.\r\nJavascript as a language is getting really nice (ES6), the ecosystem is vibrant and easy to learn.\r\n\r\nIt's also future proof as based on well known and maintained libraries. Complete compatibility with Linux should be super easy to achieve.\r\n\r\nThis is also a big step toward a complete IDE usable on web browsers, which would allow anyone with an internet connection and a recent browser to make games!\r\n\r\n## State\r\n\r\nFor now, only the scene editor is usable. Here are a few screenshots:\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1280130/23775707/43421d2c-052a-11e7-8428-ec18ba192755.png)\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1280130/23775746/7a0b0eea-052a-11e7-92c8-7302ca4e9a7f.png)\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1280130/23775756/91cd60b4-052a-11e7-9fce-aea4f4dc7814.png)\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1280130/23775954/92500aa4-052b-11e7-952d-a47283d54079.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo use the new scene editor, the user will have to activate it in the preferences (at least while it's not fully done).\r\n\r\n## Try it\r\n\r\nIt's still hard for now to try it because I've not integrated the building of libGD.js (GDevelop compiled to Javascript) to the full build. You have to manually get [GDevelop.js](https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop.js/tree/incoming), put it in the GD folder, and build it, then launch the script to copy libGD.js into newIDE.\r\nI'll work to integrate this in the CMake build later!\r\n\r\nMy next step are to continue implementing the scene editor to make it usable with every existing objects and have all the existing features. \r\nAnd to make it easy for anyone to get it to try it or contribute 😄 \r\ncc @victorlevasseur ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/347/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/346","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/346/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/346/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/346/events","html_url":"https://github.com/4ian/GD/issues/346","id":211566283,"number":346,"title":"event / read from file","user":{"login":"Translator5","id":9306861,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/9306861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Translator5","html_url":"https://github.com/Translator5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Translator5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Translator5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Translator5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Translator5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Translator5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Translator5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Translator5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Translator5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Translator5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-03-03T01:05:08Z","updated_at":"2017-03-03T12:47:25Z","closed_at":"2017-03-03T01:30:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\r\nI would like to read a text from a file and store it as a scene-variable.\r\nI got the event, set all up, but the variable still do not change.\r\n\r\nThis is my event: [File: \"file.txt\" Group: \"GROUP1\" Scene: \"distro\"]\r\nThe action do work properly.\r\n\r\nHere is the file.txt I want to read from.\r\n`<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\" ?>`\r\n`<GROUP1 texte=\"LinuxMint\" />`\r\n\r\nWhy do this not work?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/345","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/345/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/345/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/345/events","html_url":"https://github.com/4ian/GD/issues/345","id":210337459,"number":345,"title":"Where is the executeable file?","user":{"login":"JebusKD","id":26045377,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/26045377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JebusKD","html_url":"https://github.com/JebusKD","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JebusKD/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JebusKD/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JebusKD/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JebusKD/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JebusKD/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JebusKD/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JebusKD/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JebusKD/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JebusKD/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-02-26T18:31:41Z","updated_at":"2017-02-26T22:28:08Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I am so sorry or being stupid if it is somewhere clear.

is dragonbones - A free alternative to spine2d. It allows for cutout/2d mesh deform animation that has huge gains on animation size . Also allows for things like swapping body parts or overwriting movement via code.\r\n\r\nIt also allows:\r\n- reusing the same animation clip on multiple game characters with different graphics\r\n- big gains on local and virtual memory, gains in framerate\r\n- Time saver in producing the actual animated assets\r\n- Both editor and runtime are free \r\n- Smooth interpolation between animation clips\r\n- smooth inbetweens , regardless of the framerate\r\n\r\nwww.dragonbones.com\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YO7JzI-f7sc\r\n\r\nSpine costs 300$ for using their runtime - even if you dont have the editor\r\nDragonbones has all the same features, but is free\r\n\r\nDragonbones has a pixi.js runtime:\r\nhttps://github.com/DragonBones/DragonBonesJS/tree/master/Pixi\r\n\r\nwhich potentially makes it easy to implement in GD\r\n\r\nPlease implement support for dragonbones animation data support in gamedevelop.
