It uses ```std::string```\r\n internally to avoid unnecessary UTF8 iterating as the only relevant characters are {, } and the numbers.\r\n\r\nTo make this string expression possible, I added a new type to the parameters: ````variadic```. The kind of parameter obviously only works if placed at the end of an expression/action/condition parameters list. The extraInfo field is used to determine the type of the variadic parameter (only one type, either \"string\" or \"expression\", so this is more limited than the C++ parameters packs). \r\n\r\nThese parameters accepts from 0 to an infinity of values. **The editors have not been updated to allow assisted insertion of such parameters making them impossible to use currently in conditions and actions. However, the expression parser has been updated not to throw error messages due to the parameter count with variadics.**\r\n\r\n## Translation\r\n\r\nUsing the ```_(\"something here\")``` string expression, strings can be translated. A button has been added to the \"Project\" ribbon to generate a .pot file from all marked strings and an action is provided to load a translation from a .mo file.\r\n\r\nThe .mo parsing is done with a simple \"parser\" I wrote too.\r\n\r\nHere is the documentation draft of the translation feature: http://wiki.compilgames.net/doku.php/gdevelop/documentation/game_translation\r\n\r\n# Discussion\r\n\r\n**Some points I would like to discuss:**\r\n\r\n - this: #318 \r\n - The formatting parser is working but I think it can be largely optimized, ideas ?\r\n - Javascript implementation\r\n - GUI for variadic parameters in expressions editors\r\n - GUI for variadic parameters in instruction editor\r\n - Allowing (in the conventional way) .mo files to be added in the project resources (\"Image bank\").","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/318","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/318/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/318/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/318/events","html_url":"https://github.com/4ian/GD/issues/318","id":192011551,"number":318,"title":"ExpressionParser in external events","user":{"login":"victorlevasseur","id":964512,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/964512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorlevasseur","html_url":"https://github.com/victorlevasseur","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorlevasseur/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorlevasseur/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorlevasseur/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorlevasseur/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorlevasseur/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorlevasseur/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorlevasseur/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorlevasseur/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorlevasseur/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110421967,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/labels/question","name":"question","color":"cc317c","default":true}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-11-28T13:54:20Z","updated_at":"2016-11-28T13:54:20Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I wonder if it's possible to use ExpressionParser with an external event (or nothing) instead of a ```gd::Layout```.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to do is to write a custom callback to get all the _(...) string expressions from the expressions/strings from all the events of a project.

Luckily enough, MinGW provides a Microsoft extension that allows to open a C ```FILE*``` descriptor from a wide path (```wchar_t*```). The class manages the file descriptor and a filebuffer that makes the link between the ```std::iostream``` (```gd::FileStream``` as ```std::fstream``` inherits from ```iostream```).\r\n\r\nOn Linux, the class directly opens a ```std::filebuf``` and link it to the base ```std::iostream```. As the filesystem encoding is considered to follow the locale, the ```gd::String``` is converted into the current locale (often ```UTF-8``` these days) before opening the file.\r\n\r\nTests\r\n===\r\n\r\nTests have been added to test the critical parts of the class (the browsing, reading, writing operations are managed by the ```std::iostream```` so no need to test them. Only the opening/closing and states are tested).\r\n\r\nBonus Nb.1\r\n===\r\n\r\nThis PR also implements a ```gd::SFMLFileStream``` that allows SFML resources can be loaded from files like this:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\ngd::SFMLFileStream stream;\r\nstream.open(\"aaaa.png\");\r\n\r\nsf::Texture texture;\r\n texture.loadFromStream(stream);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBonus Nb.2\r\n===\r\n\r\nIt also provides two functions, one to load a ```TiXmlDocument``` from a file with ```gd::String``` and one to save it to a file.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/311","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/311/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/311/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/311/events","html_url":"https://github.com/4ian/GD/pull/311","id":188444171,"number":311,"title":"Automatic
