Events classes are in `GDCore/Events` (including the Metadata classes, CodeGeneration related classes and Builtin events). \n`GDCore/Extensions` contains the classes related to platform/extensions and builtin extensions. `GDCore/IDE` now have a few sub directories too for classes related to editing Project/Events.\n\nThe same structure is reflected in GDJS and GDCpp (Events, Project, Extensions). My goal is to have a better distinction between events (that could/should live on their own), project classes (which describe a game), the game engines (in `GDJS/Runtime` for GDJS, for GDCpp it's still in GDCpp folder but maybe one day I could move all game engine classes into GDCpp/Runtime) and the IDE classes (also everything related to wxWidgets should live at the end in `Dialogs` folders or `wxTools`). Maybe I'll also rename Dialogs to wxDialogs to emphasize the use of wxWidgets only in this folder.\n\nI've almost only moved files, nothing should be broken. Let me know if you have any concern with these changes.

implements support for saving and loading projects as \"Folder project\", meaning that scenesm external layouts and external events are stored into separate files. This can greatly enhance the collaboration on medium/large projects when more than one person is involved. people can keep working on levels in the external layouts for example, or on different scenes then share their files. :smile:\n\nThe implementation is done using a `Splitter` class that \"cut\" some part of the tree representing the whole serialized projects. The new element are containing a reference to the part that were cut (i.e: the other files). I've also moved the part writing JSON/XML files from gd::Project to a separate class (because it's not the project responsibility to manage files).\n\n@victorlevasseur If you have some time, you can pull the branch and check if you can save a few projects as folder projects, and then load them/modify them again :)\n\nThis should be one of the last feature added before releasing version 4 (still need to make sure help is easily accessible for the new AdMob banner and do a find/replace in the wiki to replace automatism by behavior). Let me know if you have something in mind apart from these points that should be addressed/fixed before v4 :smile:

working on GDevelop, there is at least 3 different part where I need to replace a substring by anothing in a string:\n- In GDJS/Exporter.cpp (to replace placeholder in generated files)\n- In the code adapting the GDevelop 3.x projects for version 4 (to replace Automatism by Behavior in type names)\n- In EventsRefactor, and potentially in other part of the code base.\n\nIt's frustrating to rely on code like:\n\n```\n   gd::String search = \"toReplace\";\n    size_t pos = str.find(search);\n    if ( pos < str.length() )\n        str = str.replace(pos, search.size(), \"replacement\");\n```\n\njust to replace a simple string.\n@victorlevasseur do you think we could make a custom replace function? Like a static one:\n\n```\n str = gd::String::replace(\"toReplace\", \"replacement\");\n```\n\nor an overloading of replace member function:\n\n```\n str = str.replace(\"toReplace\", \"replacement\");\n```\n\nNote that this is not a member function following std::string interface, so maybe it should have a capital R to emphasise this (as the other custom methods we added to gd::String).\nFinally, we could have a third boolean argument `replaceAll` that defaults to false.\n\nWhat do you reckon?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/186","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/186/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/186/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/186/events","html_url":"https://github.com/4ian/GD/pull/186","id":102644201,"number":186,"title":"Clarify
