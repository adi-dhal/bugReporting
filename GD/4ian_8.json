It now uses less memory and avoid crashing GDevelop when the amount of tiles is too high.\n\n**The changes in detail :**\n- the collidable property of **all** tiles is stored in a `std::vector<bool>` (the index is the tile id)\n- only non-default hitboxes are stored inside a `std::map<int, TileHitbox>` (the tile id is the key)\n- the tile texture coordinates (`TileTextureCoords`) are calculated on-demand (so the Tileset::Generate method was removed)\n- because of these changes (and to take advantage of them), the `TileSet` class serialization format has changed : I introduced a `version` attribute to detect the old TileMapObject serialization format. It has the nice side effect to reduce the size of the gdg file.\n\n_Now, the Tilemap object supports very big tilesets : tested with a 3000 \\* 2000px tileset with 1 \\* 1px tiles ! (GDevelop was crashing with the old version)_\n\n**EDIT** : I just saw another possible memory problem : to avoid it, `TileSet::GetTileHitbox` now only returns by value (it avoids to create the hitbox in the cache if the tile has a default hitbox) and `TileSet::GetTileHitboxRef` has been created to get a non-const reference to the hitbox (if the hitbox doesn't exist in the cache, it is created). (see the difference between these two methods which were overloads before : 3321b71)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/160","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/160/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/160/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/160/events","html_url":"https://github.com/4ian/GD/pull/160","id":98119837,"number":160,"title":"Use wxLaunchDefaultBrowser() in HelpProvider","user":{"login":"victorlevasseur","id":964512,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/964512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorlevasseur","html_url":"https://github.com/victorlevasseur","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorlevasseur/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorlevasseur/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorlevasseur/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorlevasseur/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorlevasseur/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorlevasseur/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorlevasseur/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorlevasseur/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/victorlevasseur/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-07-30T09:10:37Z","updated_at":"2015-08-06T04:16:27Z","closed_at":"2015-07-30T09:30:14Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/pulls/160","html_url":"https://github.com/4ian/GD/pull/160","diff_url":"https://github.com/4ian/GD/pull/160.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/4ian/GD/pull/160.patch"},"body":"Fix web browser not launching on Windows 10.
