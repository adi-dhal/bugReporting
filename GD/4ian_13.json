idea is to create a simple gd::String class providing a string which supports utf8 internally (inside a standard std::string) so that GD would not have to deal explicitly with utf8 problems (such as

than Utf32 (used by sf::String) and is directly compatible with the first 128 chars of ASCII.\n\nI don't have informations about how we can handle utf8 in javascript for the web platform, but I think

Panel/ScrolledWindow using it : `DrawEditor(wxDC&, wxPoint offset)`, `OnLeftDownEvent(wxMouseEvent&)` to be called from the Panel when the left mouse button is pressed.\nAlso, the class will contain the polygon \"treeview\" editor (to be added manually to its AuiManager or automatically from the ctor

outside the Extensions/TileMapObject folder : \n- I've added GD_API to the PolygonCollision function (to be able to use it in the extension)\n- Of course, I've added a line in the CMakeLists.txt to compile the extension\n\nThe extensions comes with a french translation, and two examples : a basic platformer using the tile map object and a basic level editor to show the runtime features of the object.\n\nIf you have some suggestions, I can still make some commits before you merge
