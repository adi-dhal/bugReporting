These files are the files saved by the Tiled tilemap editor, a very popular tilemap free editor. The goal is to be able to import the tileset (image and configuration), the tilemap and the hitboxes. Only orthogonal tilemaps are supported (obviously).\n\n**Library used :**\nIt uses tmxparser (https://github.com/andrewrk/tmxparser), an opensource parser using TinyXML2 (both embedded in the extension).\n\n**What is done :**\n- [X] Import the tileset configuration (except the image) : supports spacing and tilesize, not margins currently (as the extension doesn't support it)\n- [x] Import the tileset image : done in 33ff926, imports the image as imported<NUMBER>_<FILENAME>.<EXTENSION> and set this resources as the tileset image.\n- [X] Import the tilemap : the 3 first tile layers are imported into the 3 layers of the object\n- [X] Import the hitboxes : supports only one hitbox per tile, only a rectangle or a polygon\n\nThese features need testing.\n\nNote : the hitboxes are imported from tile's objects (tiles' objects can be edited in View > Tile collision editor)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4ian/GD/issues/213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4711","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507317096","x-github-request-id":"ACA6:2B9A:99647:15BD8F:59D7D394","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/21331090/issues?state=all&page=7>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/21331090/issues?state=all&page=14>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/21331090/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/21331090/issues?state=all&page=5>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"ee88d300c023cde421bcc30a44dc7866\"","status":"200 OK"}}
