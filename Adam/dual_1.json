Projects still compile just fine and will for the foreseeable future, but it will get progressively harder and less intuitive to keep things working and expanding on it. Consider switching all PCL projects to .NET Standard for v3.0.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\n- Duality PCLs use Profile111, which is equivalent to .NET Standard 1.1. Use this standard version for maximum compatibility.\r\n- .NET Standard packages require at least NuGet 2.12 or 3.4, so the Duality package manager will need to be updated to this first.\r\n  - It may also need to handle platform-dependent dependency scenarios.\r\n  - Make sure that Duality packages continue to be able to reference regular NuGet packages.\r\n- Get proficient with how .NET Standard works combined with regular .NET Framework applications and libraries when it comes to dependencies and runtime behavior.\r\n  - Make sure the editor doesn't get spammed with .NET Framework specific forward-only assemblies.\r\n  - Make sure the deployed launcher still works on platforms it worked before, like Linux and MacOS via Mono.\r\n  - What's the role of reference assemblies in this?\r\n- Some links for further research:\r\n  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42254288/referencing-a-net-standard-library-from-a-windows-class-library\r\n  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44617898/how-do-you-reference-a-net-standard-library-from-a-net-framework-4-5-console-a\r\n  - https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/410\r\n  - https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/481\r\n  - https://www.hanselman.com/blog/ReferencingNETStandardAssembliesFromBothNETCoreAndNETFramework.aspx\r\n- Projects to switch:\r\n  - FarseerDuality\r\n  - NVorbis\r\n  - Duality / Core\r\n  - Primitives\r\n  - Compatibility\r\n  - Tilemaps (core and sample)\r\n  - All sample projects\r\n  - The game plugin template\r\n- Note that it might also be required to change the AppVeyor CI settings to run in a new environment.

Summary\r\n\r\nDuality uses a [custom Farseer Physics](https://github.com/AdamsLair/farseerduality) port, which is built and deployed separately. This not only increases iteration times heavily, but it also makes Duality-specific specialization harder. Consider moving the `FarseerDuality` project into main and renaming it to `Duality.Physics`, paving the way for gradually improving and streamlining it for integrated Duality usage.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\n- Reasoning behind moving the port closer to Duality and away from its origin:\r\n  - It's based on an old Farseer version (3.3.1) and updating to the head version is unlikely because the gain / stability tradeoff doesn't sound great with regard to [unresolved issues](https://farseerphysics.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic) in the latest stable (3.5) of the original project which could easily turn out to be critical.\r\n  - Farseer will no longer be updated and Velcro will take a bit until reaching stability, so a switch is unlikely at this point.\r\n  - The custom Duality port of Farseer has already deviated from the original a lot.\r\n  - It has also proven itself to be very stable over the past years.\r\n  - With the above in mind, further deviation and specialization towards Duality might be beneficial.\r\n  - As there will be no direct merge between core and physics library, switching to a different physics library internally will always remain a possibility.\r\n- The project should probably be located in `Source/Core/Physics` next to `Primitives` and `Duality`.\r\n  - Could consider renaming the folders to `Duality.Physics` and `Duality.Primitives`, but should apply the same naming convention to the `Source/Editor` folders as well, making them `Duality.Editor` and `Duality.Updater`.\r\n  - This would prompt renaming their project files as well. Lots of renames, but then project names, package names and namespaces would be aligned.\r\n- Even when moving it to the main repository, physics should remain a separate project.\r\n- Efficiency / performance improvement akin to https://github.com/VelcroPhysics/VelcroPhysics/issues/29 can be considered in future iterations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/570/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/569","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/569/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/569/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/569/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/pull/569","id":262000384,"number":569,"title":"Added

Summary\r\n\r\nWhile investigating issue #219, it became apparent that the way Duality handles uniform shader variables on the core side is currently lacking. There are no efficient specialized data structures for this task, and there is no support for global shader variables besides a small set of builtin ones. The backend also updates variables too eagerly, causing redundant GL calls.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\n- Introduce a `ShaderParameters` class that encapsulates storage of any number of shader-field-to-value mappings that are agnostic to specific shader programs, and use it in `BatchInfo` instead of the current two dictionary solution.\r\n  - Consider going with an array-of-structs approach where the struct is an internal union type for storing different kinds of values.\r\n  - Consider using a single float array to store all float value data, e.g. floats, vectors, matrices and arrays of each kind.\r\n  - Make sure comparing two `ShaderParameters` instances for value equality is very efficient.\r\n  - Make sure retrieving values by name or other means is very efficient.\r\n  - Write unit tests for this container class.\r\n- Transform the static `BuiltinShaderFields` into `GlobalShaderFields` class and move it to the `Duality.Drawing` namespace. Provide API to allow users to set values manually.\r\n  - Consider removing DrawTechnique virtual API that is used for that purpose for dynamic lighting and similar use cases, provided it could then be replaced with using global variables.\r\n- Update the backend to only set global variables on a per-program basis in the beginning of a `Render` call, rather than on a per-material level.\r\n  - Consider also storing the last set parameters in the native shader program implementation and avoid setting them if the new values are still the same. Could actually do this with `ShaderParameters` as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/566/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/565","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/565/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/565/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/565/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/565","id":256536831,"number":565,"title":"Write

work?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/564/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/563","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/563/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/563/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/563/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/563","id":255706654,"number":563,"title":"Check

Summary\r\n\r\nThe use of `Canvas.FillPolygonOutline(Vector2[], float, float, float, float)` with a negative second parameter (width) will cause an incorrect outline which is not pixel correct to the specified negative width.\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce [Bugs]\r\n\r\n* Create a new Duality project\r\n* Create a new component with the following code:\r\n```\r\npublic class OutlineTest : Component, ICmpRenderer\r\n{\r\n  public float BoundRadius { get; }\r\n\r\n  public void Draw(IDrawDevice device)\r\n  {\r\n    const float borderWidth = 5;\r\n    const float minPos = 100;\r\n    const float maxPos = 200;\r\n    var canvas = new Canvas(device);\r\n\r\n    canvas.PushState();\r\n    canvas.State.ColorTint = ColorRgba.Red;\r\n\r\n    // Polygon outer border\r\n    canvas.DrawPolygon(new[] { new Vector2(minPos - borderWidth, minPos - borderWidth), new Vector2(maxPos + borderWidth, minPos - borderWidth), new Vector2(maxPos + borderWidth, maxPos + borderWidth), new Vector2(minPos - borderWidth, maxPos + borderWidth) }, 0, 0, 1);\r\n\r\n    // Polygon position\r\n    canvas.DrawPolygon(new[] { new Vector2(minPos, minPos), new Vector2(maxPos, minPos), new Vector2(maxPos, maxPos), new Vector2(minPos, maxPos) }, 0, 0, 1);\r\n\r\n    // Polygon inner border\r\n    canvas.DrawPolygon(new[] { new Vector2(minPos + borderWidth, minPos + borderWidth), new Vector2(maxPos - borderWidth, minPos + borderWidth), new Vector2(maxPos - borderWidth, maxPos - borderWidth), new Vector2(minPos + borderWidth, maxPos - borderWidth) }, 0, 0, 1);\r\n\r\n    canvas.PopState();\r\n\r\n    // Fill outer outline\r\n    canvas.PushState();\r\n    canvas.State.ColorTint = ColorRgba.White;\r\n    canvas.FillPolygonOutline(new[] { new Vector2(minPos, minPos), new Vector2(maxPos, minPos), new Vector2(maxPos, maxPos), new Vector2(minPos, maxPos) }, borderWidth, 0, 0, 10);\r\n    canvas.PopState();\r\n\r\n    // Fill inner outline (wrong results here)\r\n    canvas.PushState();\r\n    canvas.State.ColorTint = ColorRgba.Blue;\r\n    canvas.FillPolygonOutline(new[] { new Vector2(minPos, minPos), new Vector2(maxPos, minPos), new Vector2(maxPos, maxPos), new Vector2(minPos, maxPos) }, -borderWidth, 0, 0, 10);\r\n    canvas.PopState();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public bool IsVisible(IDrawDevice device)\r\n  {\r\n    if ((device.VisibilityMask & VisibilityFlag.ScreenOverlay) != VisibilityFlag.None) return false;\r\n    if ((device.VisibilityMask & device.VisibilityMask & VisibilityFlag.AllGroups) == VisibilityFlag.None) return false;\r\n    return true;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n* Place the component on the scene\r\n* Set the perspective of the main camera to flat and place the camera right above the now drawn rectangles\r\n\r\nThe component draws three polygons in red representing the intended polygon itself in its middle and the two borders, one outer border and one inner border. Both borders have the same distance to the intended polygon.\r\n\r\nThe white drawn outline is correct, because it touches the red outer polygon line and begins at the intended polying. In contrast the blue drawn outline begins at the intended polygon, but exceeds the red inner polygon by far. My expectation is, that even when using negative width at `Canvas.FillPolygonOutline` it draws a inner outline with correct pixel width.\r\n\r\n### Workaround [Bugs]\r\n\r\nNo clean workaround is known. You can only try to adjust the negative width with a number which will result in the desired inner outline. For the sample used dividing the negative width with 7.065f will produce an acceptable result. But this does not seem to work for other shapes.\r\n\r\n### Attachments\r\n\r\n![innerpolygonoutlinebug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30325942/29752769-6156ba82-8b64-11e7-906e-9457f03ff3e4.jpg)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/562/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/561","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/561/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/561/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/561/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/561","id":252959389,"number":561,"title":"Write a Wiki Article on \"Plugin Handling\"","user":{"login":"ilexp","id":14859411,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/14859411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp","html_url":"https://github.com/ilexp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48735605,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Documentation","name":"Documentation","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":48735364,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Task","name":"Task","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/7","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/milestone/7","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/7/labels","id":2072583,"number":7,"title":"Learning Curve","description":"Improving the documentation of Duality and making it easier for new users to use and join the project.","creator":{"login":"ilexp","id":14859411,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/14859411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp","html_url":"https://github.com/ilexp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":7,"closed_issues":6,"state":"open","created_at":"2016-10-16T13:51:04Z","updated_at":"2017-08-25T16:49:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-08-25T16:49:01Z","updated_at":"2017-08-25T16:49:01Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"### Summary\r\n\r\nWrite a wiki article that deals with how Duality handles plugins and plugin reloads in the editor.

Summary\r\n\r\nAn extension of the CorePlugin API would be appreciated which enables the plugin to determine the running state in Dualitor. I suggest it should be possible on plugin level to know the following things:\r\n\r\n* Dualitor starts running the game\r\n* Dualitor pauses the game\r\n* Dualitor resumes from pause\r\n* Dualitor stops the game completly\r\n\r\nWith these four events/callbacks you have the maximum flexibility to react on editor interactions.\r\n\r\n### Analysis [Feature Requests]\r\n\r\nIn my case my benefit is, that I am able to do core plugin specific cleanup on stopping the execution within the editor. Using the Launcher the plugin can rely on the Terminate event on DualityApp. But this does not trigger in editor mode which is understandable. In my case I use background tasks for networking across multiple scenes, so I have to shut them down on stop to ensure a clean state of the plugin. Next time it runs in the editor it can start right from the beginning.\r\n\r\nI also will need the \"start running the game\" signal later. It can be used excellently for starting right in the middle of the game in a specific scene. Normally you need some scenes before to get to that point, but this is time consuming to do it every time you want to debug. So you can change your game start scene to the middle of the game and use a specific debug component which gets a event from your CorePlugin that it has been started running in the editor. The network server my core plugin is connecting to will have a rejoin capability, so the core plugin can right join a specific or the last session, when it knows it is started within the editor.  Normally the establishing of the server connection have to be done much earlier, but via the special editor event it can be done directly in a debug component within the scene. The development experience would be really enhanced by this for me.\r\n\r\nIt may also be a nice benefit to enable the determiniation of pause and resume in Dualitor. Then you can decide yourself if you need to stop something in the background or not when editor pauses the game. In my specific case I will not need this feature, because the networking should even be done in pause, otherwise a disconnect may happen which is not my intention in pause. But I still can imagine cases where even in pause, game related background stuff have to be adjusted or also paused. A case where I think of may be a simulation game, where the game calculates the simulation stuff in background because it's much to time consuming to do in the Update call. It may be wise to also stop any simulation on pause, so the game will not go on while rendering is stopped.\r\n\r\nPotential API extension:\r\nAn extension of Duality.CorePlugin may be solution. I personally already like the OnExecContextChanged handling. May be one new method with something similar and a argument for the new state (run, pause, resume and stop) the editor is changing in would be sufficient. \r\n\r\nBecause of the relation of this feature to the editor it's best not to call the new method, when the game runs through the Launcher respectively outside of Dualitor. So it will remain exclusive for editor behaviour/interaction.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/556","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/556/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/556/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/556/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/556","id":247936874,"number":556,"title":"Request for Adding Sprite Editor","user":{"login":"leontzh97","id":29882927,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/29882927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leontzh97","html_url":"https://github.com/leontzh97","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leontzh97/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leontzh97/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leontzh97/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leontzh97/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leontzh97/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leontzh97/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leontzh97/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leontzh97/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leontzh97/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48735426,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Editor","name":"Editor","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":48735357,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-08-04T08:26:00Z","updated_at":"2017-08-05T03:19:36Z","closed_at":"2017-08-04T17:50:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Summary\r\nHi, developers.\r\n\r\nI'm here to request a feature to add into the Duality. It's called the Sprite Editor. It's because I, as a user, likes to create my own sprite. However I likes to use simple program like microsoft paint which is built in on my computer to create sprites because I'm really lazy to downloads other software. Yet, an issue that is the background of my created sprites aren't transparent.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I request a new feature is to make the sprites' background become transparent.\r\n\r\n### Analysis [Feature Requests]\r\n- This feature might benefits those users that likes to create own sprite for own creation.\r\n- It might also helps user to save time to convert the sprite background from different software.\r\n\r\n- I suggest that developers can refer to microsoft word's remove background features.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHope to have this feature soon.\r\nThank

Summary\r\n\r\nI wanted to deactivate the ScreenOverlay layer. So I deactivatet the ScreenOverlay flag from the viewing camera. This causes that SpriteRender Game Objects are now drawn two times if they are approximately at 0 < X < ScreenWidth, 0 < Y < ScreenHeight position: They will be drawn in their world postion and in their UI position, which is not the expected behaviour from developer perspective. I would expect no changes on the view for Game Objects which have no ScreenOverlay flag set. The sprite should be rendered only in its world position and not in the UI layer.\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce [Bugs]\r\n\r\nA simple scene with two game objects is needed to reprosduce:\r\n* Create a new Duality project with a new screne\r\n* Create a Camera with X, Y set to zero and Z to -500. VisibilityMask should be All.\r\n* Create a Sprite using SpriteRenderer with a random graphic with X, Y, Z set to zero. Ensure VisbilityGroup of the Sprite is only Group0.\r\n* Use the scene editor and use the created camera for viewing the scene, you should see the sprite in the center of the screen.\r\n* Remove the ScreenOverlay flag from the VisiblitlyMask of the created Camera\r\n\r\n==> The sprite can be seen two times now, one time for normal rendering in its world position in the center and one time for the UI rendering in its UI position which ist top left of the screen. The sprite may been have been clipped a bit. \r\n\r\n### Workaround [Bugs]\r\n\r\n* For hiding the UI the other workaround which may used would be adjusting the Visibility of every UI-related Game Object to None. Therefore you need complete knowledge of you UI Game Objects instead of simple deactivating the UI on the camera.\r\n\r\n### Analysis [Feature Requests]\r\n\r\nI personally would prefer an adjustment of all affected Render classes (like SpriteRenderer) even if it is a strong breaking change. The behaviour as it is now, makes no sense, so I would consider it a bugfix.\r\n\r\nSo a change of the code within...\r\n\r\npublic virtual bool IsVisible(IDrawDevice device)\r\n\r\n...on the Render

Summary\r\n\r\nNot sure entirely what's triggering this, but at some point when rebuilding my plugins, the Duality Editor decides to continually crash.\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce [Bugs]\r\n\r\nSo as far as I know, these are the steps I took:\r\n1. Writing an editor and core plugin.\r\n2. Adding a custom component from the core plugin to my project view.\r\n3. Rebuilding the plugins a few times on changing/adding things.\r\n4. In trying to figure out why my editor plugin's importer class wasn't working, Adam pointed out that it wasn't public (doh!). Switched it to public and rebuilt.\r\n5. Duality Editor crashes on each launch.\r\n\r\n#### Extra:\r\nRemoving that public line from the importer class doesn't fix the crashes. As far as I'm aware, that had nothing to do with the actual crash - It seemed to just be the trigger for corrupting whatever's crashing the editor.\r\n\r\n### Workaround [Bugs]\r\n\r\n- Create a new, fresh project. \r\n- Copy code over from previous project.\r\n- Rebuild and the editor works as it should.\r\n\r\n### Attachments\r\n- [logfile_editor.txt](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/files/1168080/logfile_editor.txt)\r\n- (Crashing Project) [BaseGame.zip](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/files/1168081/BaseGame.zip)\r\n\r\n**Note**: I had to delete the contents of Source/Packages to get the zip below the file size limit.

The intention is to make one's life easier by providing shortcuts for common calculations.\r\n\r\n### List of suggestions\r\n\r\n1. Vector component properties for `Vector2` and `Vector3` types. Obtaining the X, Y and Z vector components quickly. Names are arguable.\r\nImplementation example:\r\n``` csharp\r\nstruct Vector3 {\r\n    Vector3 XVector { get { return new Vector3 (this.X, 0f, 0f); } }\r\n    Vector3 YVector { get { return new Vector3 (0f, this.Y, 0f); } }\r\n    Vector3 ZVector { get { return new Vector3 (0f, 0f, this.Z); } }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. More coordinate selector properties for `Rect`. Convenient access for: `TopMiddle`, `RightMiddle`, `BottomMiddle` and `LeftMiddle` coordinates.\r\n\r\n3. A saturation function to the `MathF` class. Similar to `Sign`, but accepts an epsilon value too.\r\nImplementation example:\r\n``` csharp\r\nfloat Saturate (float val, float eps)\r\n{\r\n    if (Abs (val) <= eps) return 0f;\r\n    return Sign (val);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n4. `Clamp` is quite often used with `0f` and `1f` as boundaries. Let's create a function for that: `Clamp01`.\r\n\r\n5. Inverse linear interpolation to `MathF`, and possibly to `Vector2` and `Vector3`.\r\nImplementation example:\r\n``` csharp\r\nfloat InvLerp (float value, float min, float max)\r\n{\r\n    return (value - min) / (max - min);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. Inverse linear interpolation with `0f` and `1f` as boundaries.\r\n\r\n7. Introduce the well known `smoothstep` function to `MathF`. The formula is `x * x * (3 - 2 * x)`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/550/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/549","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/549/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/549/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/549/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/549","id":241513195,"number":549,"title":"Create

Summary\r\n\r\nDuality currently allows to handle simple serialization errors like renamed types or members, or type conversions using custom `SerializeErrorHandler` implementations. While nice, what is lacking is a more fundamental way to version serialized data, which is supported by the serialization system itself.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\nThe basic idea of an extended approach to handling serialization between different type versions is to serialize a version number along with each type and, when detecting a mismatch, look for classes implementing a handler interface across all plugins that report to be able to handle that specific type and version change.\r\n\r\n#### Type Identification\r\n\r\n- Renaming a type or moving it to a different namespace is a reasonably common operation that should not require a full-fledged handler implementation.\r\n- Instead, adopt a declarative, attribute-based approach similar to `FormerlySerializedAs` that Unity provides for fields that have been renamed - just for type names instead of fields.\r\n\r\n#### Type Versioning\r\n\r\n- Due to the plugin-based nature of Duality, versioning needs to be fine-grained down to a type level. One version number per file is not going to be enough.\r\n- Serializer implementations could create a registry of serialized versions once per continuous serialization operation where each encountered type is mapped to a version.\r\n- Versioning could be based on the types assembly version number, aligning with semantic versioning release models and implying a deliberate change from version A to version B that can be addressed in a handler when needed.\r\n- For developers who operate between versions, it might also be useful to be able to temporarily assign a specific version number to a type (that differs from the assembly version) via attribute.\r\n- **issue:** The vast majority of assembly version changes do not entail breaking serialization changes. They should be treated accordingly.\r\n  - Instead of assuming that a version change is breaking by default, assume they are non-breaking by default.\r\n  - A breaking change needs to be stated explicitly to trigger the version mismatch handling - for example by allowing to state a \"minimum serialized version\" for a type when a breaking change is introduced, serialization-wise.\r\n  - Could be stated via attribute.\r\n\r\n#### Version Mismatch Handling\r\n\r\n- A handler interface / type group could use a `ISerializeVersionMismatchHandler` terminology. Open for suggestions if you can come up with something shorter.\r\n- Exact API will have to be prototyped alongside a concrete example.\r\n- When a serializer encounters an old version of a type and identified a mismatch handler implementation able to handle that, it would read all of the objects fields, store them as a list of key-value-pairs and then invoke the mismatch handler API in a similar way that `ISerializeExplicit` works: By handing over an `IDataReader` and letting the handler create and populate an object from that.\r\n\r\n#### Serialization Versioning Plugins\r\n\r\n- Ideally, it should be possible (but by no means required!) to group all information related to serialization compatibility (`FormerlySerializedAs`, `MinSerializationVersion` attributes, `ISerializeVersionMismatchHandler` implementations, other stuff?) in a distinct plugin, so Duality and other libraries could ship with a \"compatibility\" plugin and keeping their core free of legacy clutter.\r\n- Handlers are separate by default, the attributes could come in two versions: One attached to a type directly, another on an assembly-level.\r\n  - This info should be cached in `SerializeType` for perf reasons.\r\n\r\n#### Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\n- It should be possible to implement this in a 100% backwards compatible way, from a serialized data point of view.\r\n- However, since the old SerializeErrorHandlers will likely no longer exist, this would still be a breaking change for all plugins relying on them.\r\n- It _might_ be possible to implement this in v2.x without removing any of the old stuff and only removing it in v3.0 though. Could be worth the effort.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/545/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/544","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/544/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/544/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/544/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/544","id":237279598,"number":544,"title":"\"Unable
