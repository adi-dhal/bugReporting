described [here](http://forum.adamslair.net/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=555), it would be a good idea to thoroughly test v2.0 by implementing some more sample projects.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If you're contributing to this issue, the default should be to create your own, distinct sample repository, rather than working on the official one and creating Pull Requests. You can still release your sample packages using NuGet and they will show up in the Duality Package Manager / Sample Browser.\n\nNuGet Docs: [here](https://docs.nuget.org/create)\nPackage Specs (Look at the `.Sample` ones): [here](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/tree/master/NuGetPackageSpecs)\n\n**Note:** Sample Projects with more than 1 MB content size in total (Data directory) shouldn't go into the main repo at all, but into a distinct sample repo. As a general rule of thumb, a main repo sample ideally should stay below 500 KB to keep the history small. None of this applies for sample projects in distinct repositories - which is another reason why they should be preferred.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/211/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/210","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/210/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/210/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/210/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/210","id":106179752,"number":210,"title":"Invalid

though moving a project from v1.x to v2.0 isn't recommended or easy, it would be a good thing to get as much users as possible on the v2.0 boat soon, to prevent confusion like \"Which version are you on?\" and \"Why does that API result in a compile error?\". To achieve this, there should be an upgrade guide for existing projects.\n- Warn users that it won't be easy or one-click-and-done, but still possible if some effort is acceptable.\n- Explain the base procedure:\n  - Make sure all game content is using the XML format.\n  - Upgrade editor and dependency plugins to v2.0. If dependencies aren't available in v2.0 yet, wait until they are.\n  - Install the v2.0 backend plugins.\n  - Close the editor and keep it closed.\n  - Upgrade the game plugin project.\n    - Edit its .csproj file to be a PCL project.\n    - Remove references to OpenTK and System.XY assemblies.\n    - Add reference to DualityPrimitives.\n    - Fix compile errors (renamed and moved classes, adjusted API).\n    - Recompile!\n  - Perform a text replace across all .res files with the provided list of renamed and relocated type names.\n  - Open the editor and click on a few Resources. Have a look at the Log View. If there are errors, look out for type names that couldn't be resolved, close the editor and perform the replace step with them. Repeat until there are no more errors.\n  - Delete and Re-Import all Fonts.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/208/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/207","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/207/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/207/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/207/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/207","id":105191852,"number":207,"title":"Write a v2.0 Release Changelog","user":{"login":"AdamsLair","id":5013908,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5013908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48735364,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Task","name":"Task","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/4/labels","id":989404,"number":4,"title":"v2.0","description":"\"Coming Soon\" Stuff that would introduce too many or too severe breaking changes to be released in anything less than a major version step.","creator":{"login":"AdamsLair","id":5013908,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5013908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":24,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-02-21T15:06:22Z","updated_at":"2015-10-19T12:30:30Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2015-10-19T12:30:30Z"},"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-09-07T10:31:05Z","updated_at":"2015-09-12T17:36:53Z","closed_at":"2015-09-12T17:36:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Go through the commit history since the v1.x branch and gather all that has changed.

As a result, importers can only construct Resources from a single source file each.\n- Copying a file to `Source/Media` automatically triggers an import. There are situations where this is not desired.\n- Resources specify their source file in a Property for auto-reload in the editor. They can only react to a single file.\n- The overall importer API is old and has grown organically. It might need a redesign.\n\nSince there are many other important in the v2.0 milestone, this should **not** be resolved by creating a whole new asset management system, but instead be addressed with a reasonably low amount of changes.\n### ToDo\n- `Source/Media` should no longer trigger imports based on added files.\n  - Instead, the Project View should trigger them based on incoming dragdrop operations of non-Resource files directly.\n  - All the re-usable import logic should be located in the editors importer system, not the Project View.\n  - Project View dragdrop should copy the files into the proper `Source/Media` directory first, then trigger the import operation.\n- Resources should specify a list of source files if need be, rather than only a single one.\n  - Changes in `Source/Media` should trigger re-import operations accordingly.\n  - When looking for a Resource file to reload, make sure to use the recently introduced similar directory structure between `Data` and `Source/Media`.\n- Importers should be able to use any amount of files from a single import operation and leave the rest to followup importers until all files have been used.\n  - Unused files should spawn an error dialog as usual.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/202","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/202/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/202/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/202/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/202","id":98695176,"number":202,"title":"Add

Unfortunately, Serialization will have a hard time coping with this, to the point that I would consider TypeInfo completely unsupported as a serializable type.\n- The .Net Framework makes `TypeInfo` derive from `Type` in .Net 4.5, but Windows Store apps have `Type` derive from `object`, and `TypeInfo` directly from `MemberInfo`.\n- At runtime in .Net 4.5, these are `RuntimeType` objects, which derive from `TypeInfo`, which derives from `Type`. Thus, the two classes are completely indistinguishable when serializing them, because `RuntimeType` is simply _both_ of them.\n- When deserializing, a decision needs to be made which kind of object to retrieve - `TypeInfo` or `Type`. This choice is purely virtual in .Net 4.5, but distinctive in Windows Store apps. Choosing the wrong one will result in an error when attempting to assign the value to a field or array index.\n\nThis results in an erroneous deserialization of content, depending on whether the underlying platform implements Type as part of the TypeInfo inheritance or not. There is nothing Duality can do about this, because **there is no difference between the two for an object in the .Net 4.5 runtime**.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/197","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/197/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/197/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/197/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/197","id":85721185,"number":197,"title":"PropertyGrid

If achievable, however, it would be preferable if the Duality core was an actual PCL and all platform-specifics could be moved to a plugin.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/185/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/184","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/184/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/184/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/184/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/184","id":66934481,"number":184,"title":"Introduce an OpenTK Abstraction Layer","user":{"login":"AdamsLair","id":5013908,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5013908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48735426,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Editor","name":"Editor","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":48735364,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Task","name":"Task","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/4/labels","id":989404,"number":4,"title":"v2.0","description":"\"Coming Soon\" Stuff that would introduce too many or too severe breaking changes to be released in anything less than a major version step.","creator":{"login":"AdamsLair","id":5013908,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5013908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":24,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-02-21T15:06:22Z","updated_at":"2015-10-19T12:30:30Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2015-10-19T12:30:30Z"},"comments":14,"created_at":"2015-04-07T16:42:25Z","updated_at":"2015-05-18T09:43:10Z","closed_at":"2015-05-18T09:43:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For future multiplatform support and flexibility, there should be **no direct connection** between the Duality Core, Editor, Game or any of their Plugins and OpenTK.
