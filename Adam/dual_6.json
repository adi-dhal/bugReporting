Issue Text_\n\nAs described below, it is possible to select a Component for filtering in the Camera View, then delete the Component type entirely, rebuild the plugin and still have the (now invalid) filtering active, not displaying any object. This is likely also a problem even for still existing types after plugin reload, since the stored `Type` instances will no longer be valid.\n\n---\n\n_Original Issue Text:_\n\nRight now, to hide a gameobject, we have to select all of its components. This is annoying because if I want to hide all my SpriteRenderers, I'll have to hide Transforms too for example.\n\nHow to fix this ? \n- easiest option : hide a gameoject if one of its component is hidden\n- hardest but maybe best option : make it so we can hide components separately. For example, being able to hide SpriteRenderers while keeping all RigidbodyRenderer.\n\nBy the way, is it even useful to see in the list components that doesn't render anything ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/419/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/418","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/418/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/418/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/418/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/418","id":184579979,"number":418,"title":"Investigate Potential Editor Bug on Editor Plugin Init Failure","user":{"login":"ilexp","id":14859411,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/14859411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp","html_url":"https://github.com/ilexp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48735356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":48735426,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Editor","name":"Editor","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2/labels","id":856226,"number":2,"title":"General","description":"Improving the existing functionality of Duality without creating whole new modules or systems.","creator":{"login":"AdamsLair","id":5013908,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5013908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"open_issues":66,"closed_issues":237,"state":"open","created_at":"2014-11-06T17:02:30Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T18:50:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-10-21T22:02:55Z","updated_at":"2016-10-23T08:27:25Z","closed_at":"2016-10-23T08:27:25Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"### Summary\n\nAs described [here](http://forum.adamslair.net/viewtopic.php?p=5974#p5974), there might be an editor instability that is caused by an editor plugin failing to initialize.
