There needs to be a central API for that.\n  - Consider adding it to the `IGraphicsBackend` directly, with the actual backend implementations pulling from there internally.\n- Update the BasicMenu sample to only render the ingame cursor when the system cursor is inactive.

now, parts of the vertex transformation in rendering happens on the CPU using `PreprocessCoords` or manually:\n- Transforming world coordinates to camera coordinates\n- Applying object-local scale depending on camera distance\n- Rotating the object locally around its center\n\nThis approach **has several problems**:\n- Typical GPU work is done on the CPU with poor performance.\n- Vertex Shaders never have access to the original world coordinates of a vertex and cannot adjust or react to them in a meaningful way.\n\nBut it also **solves the following problem**:\n- The fake perspective that is used in parallax 2D projection requires to scale objects around their local center / origin. No global transformation can properly transform all incoming vertices at once, so a per-object transformation is required. However, per-object uniform data would prevent efficient batch rendering and actually make performance worse.\n\nIf there is a way to solve this using a GPU vertex transform approach, there's no reason not to move all vertex transform calculations to the GPU for better shader support and performance. Customized solutions could still be implemented using custom shaders.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/218","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/218/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/218/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/218/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/218","id":110030855,"number":218,"title":"Add Implicit Shader Uniforms","user":{"login":"ilexp","id":14859411,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/14859411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp","html_url":"https://github.com/ilexp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48735419,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Core","name":"Core","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":48735357,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":48735612,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Usability","name":"Usability","color":"d4c5f9","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2/labels","id":856226,"number":2,"title":"General","description":"Improving the existing functionality of Duality without creating whole new modules or systems.","creator":{"login":"AdamsLair","id":5013908,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5013908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"open_issues":66,"closed_issues":237,"state":"open","created_at":"2014-11-06T17:02:30Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T18:50:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-10-06T15:13:23Z","updated_at":"2015-10-10T18:39:45Z","closed_at":"2015-10-10T18:39:45Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"As discussed [here](http://forum.adamslair.net/viewtopic.php?p=3232#p3232), the graphics backend should automatically set certain shader uniform variables, if a shader defines them.\n\nCandidates for this:\n- Useful for Effects\n  - `GameTime`, in seconds, as a `float`\n  - `RealTime`, in seconds, as a `float`\n- Diagnostics\n  - `FrameCount`, as an `int`\n  - `BatchIndex`, as an `int`\n  - `MaterialIndex`, as an `int`\n- Others?\n\nAlso, it would be worth considering whether a generic way to define these builtin uniforms would make sense.

mentioned by @SirePi [here](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/93#issuecomment-58672672), it would be nice to have a way of packaging together Resources in a container single file. This could be implemented easily in the `ContentProvider` class.\n- Introduce a Resource Package file format (file extension `.rpk` maybe?), which is essentially a disguised `.zip` as usable by `System.IO.Compression`.\n- Any package file is treated as a virtual directory, which can be addressed as usual with path strings.\n  - The file `Data\\SomeDir.rpk` would be treated the same as `Data\\SomeDir`.\n  - The Resource path `Data\\SomeDir\\SomeTex.Texture.res` would work all the same, regardless of whether `SomeDir` is a directory, or a `SomeDir.rpk` package file.\n- Provide a `LoadPackage` method that allows to load all Resources inside a Resource path.\n  - It shouldn't matter whether `Data\\SomeDir` actually resolved to a package file or a directory.\n\nReflect on this and its implications a bit more until implementing. This is a non-breaking addition to the framework. No need for pre-v2.0 implementation.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/216/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/215","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/215/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/215/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/215/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/pull/215","id":109159375,"number":215,"title":"Allow
