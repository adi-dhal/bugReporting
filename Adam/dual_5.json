These tilesets do not contain tiles with corner specific connectivity For example in the following tilemap (where x means tile and o means empty - a tile from a different autotile set), both tiles should fallback to the no-connection one. Note, that this example works as expected in Duality, but there are problems with some more convoluted cases.\r\n```\r\no o o o\r\no x o o\r\no o x o\r\no o o o\r\n```\r\n### How to reproduce [Bugs]\r\n1. Create a 16 part tileset. Use this image, if you don't have better. It has a transparent row below.\r\n![tileset](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12499658/21072967/9781ae0e-bed3-11e6-8553-987313407bce.png)\r\n2.

This would be a really useful addition with a big usability increase.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\nQuote from the original issue #54:\r\n\r\n> As soon as non-convex polygons with N vertices are supported, it would make a lot more sense to have a nice vertex editor. Maybe there could be a shared \"edit shape\" tool that would allow to:\r\n> - Resize (using radius \"vertex\") and move (using center \"vertex\") circles.\r\n> - Move vertices of a poly-like shape. \r\n> - Dynamically add vertices to a poly-like shape by dragging a point on the outline where currently no vertex exists.\r\n> - Deleting vertices from a poly-like shape.\r\n> - Make sure that it's possible to see the generated individual convex shapes, so it becomes apparent to the user that arbitrarily complex shapes are not \"free\". Maybe somehow visualize a \"less is better\" relation for vertex and fixture count?\r\n> - Multi-selection might not be required, or at least should be carefully evaluated for its cost / benefit ratio. My guess would be it's not actually that useful in this case.\r\n> - _Implementation note:_ Vertex editing should not be implemented using the SelObj / ObjectEditor API, since that would (a) bring more overhead than usefulness and (b) merge vertex editing with shape editing. \r\n>   - Instead, do a lightweight implementation in a separate RigidBodyEditorTool.\r\n>   - This may require extending and modifying how RigidBodyEditorTools work, specifically allowing multiple begin / end cycles without deselecting.\r\n>\r\n> As a soft prerequisite, there probably should be a base ShapeInfo API / class for the various ShapeInfos (Poly, Loop, Chain) to reduce the amount of type checking code and keep it more extensible. This would also allow to simplify some RigidBodyShapeCamViewLayer rendering, RigidBodyRenderer and RigidBodyEditor code a lot.\r\n\r\n- This issue still requires some concept work.\r\n- Requirement: Issue #446 \r\n- Could benefit from issue #331, but that would mean moving this to v3.0\r\n- Could also benefit from a previous refactoring / cleanup of the RigidBody editor where needed.\r\n\r\n###

This will be useful for the `RigidBodyRenderer`.\r\n- As far as size limitations go, investigate whether the eight-vertex limit is really an issue for Farseer and remove it without replacement if it isn't.\r\n- Test RigidBody behavior thoroughly after these changes.\r\n- Update the RigidBody Editor to reflect the above changes.\r\n\r\n### Attachments\r\n\r\n- Related: issue #54 \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/445","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/445/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/445/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/445/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/445","id":192689137,"number":445,"title":"Introduce a way to load the last open scene in the editor","user":{"login":"ChristianGreiner","id":6233308,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6233308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianGreiner","html_url":"https://github.com/ChristianGreiner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianGreiner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianGreiner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianGreiner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianGreiner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianGreiner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianGreiner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianGreiner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianGreiner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianGreiner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48735426,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Editor","name":"Editor","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":48735357,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":76590897,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Non-Critical","name":"Non-Critical","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":50803016,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Up%20For%20Grabs","name":"Up For Grabs","color":"006b75","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2/labels","id":856226,"number":2,"title":"General","description":"Improving the existing functionality of Duality without creating whole new modules or systems.","creator":{"login":"AdamsLair","id":5013908,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5013908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"open_issues":66,"closed_issues":237,"state":"open","created_at":"2014-11-06T17:02:30Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T18:50:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-11-30T21:47:13Z","updated_at":"2016-12-01T16:45:47Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"At the moment the editor doesn't open any scene after you launched it. \r\nIt would be nice, if you could toggle an option, so the editor loads the last open scene automatically .\r\n\r\nThe toggleable option have to be stored in the AppData (default UserData).\r\n(see [here](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/13#issuecomment-137739542))\r\n\r\nSome thoughts from the community:\r\n> [22:20] SirePi: maybe a question, after you open \"do you want to load the last edited scene?\"\r\n> [22:21] loeller: I think a popup is rather annoying\r\n> [22:22] loeller: but most of the times you want to continue with the one you worked previously\r\n> [22:23] loeller: actually, it can be a toggleable setting.

Summary\r\n\r\nWhile the existing package management solution works great for plugins and samples, there is currently no easy way to quickly set up a project of a certain kind by installing a set of packages. Packages are considered atomic and read-only - something else is required for quick project setup.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\n- It is always possible to install sample packages and manually integrate their source code, and write a `SerializeErrorHandler` that will fix resource issues due to switching namespaces.\r\n- This is tedious work though, which defies the idea of a quick setup.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\n- The ultimate goal of this feature would be allowing users to quickly set up platformers, shooters or similar from sample projects, or pull in the particle system or camera handling sample just for their source code, deleting stuff that isn't necessary and quickly adjusting the rest.\r\n- This could be solved by either introducing a new package type (`Template` packages) with special behavior.\r\n- A likely better / more flexible solution would be to instead offer an alternative \"integration\" install mode that can be applied to any installed package.\r\n- Integration mode will do the following:\r\n  - Included project files will be examined and deconstructed. \r\n    - All included files will be copied over to a subfolder of the existing game plugin source folder, and they will be included in the existing game plugin project instead.\r\n    - Will have to distinguish between core and editor plugins. Default to editor, treat core as a more restrictive special case.\r\n    - All dependencies need to be integrated with the existing game plugin dependencies.\r\n  - The default namespace of source files (as found in the project file) will be changed to match a sub-namespace of the game plugins main namespace.\r\n  - A `SerializeErrorHandler` implementation will be auto-generated to resolve any renaming issues that arise from this.\r\n  - Included data / resources can remain as-is.\r\n  - Included plugins and binaries can remain as-is.\r\n    - Exception: The plugin binaries that would have been generated from the included source. Those need to be filtered out.\r\n  - The game plugin will have to be recompiled.\r\n  - The installed package will not be added to the package configuration file and its folder in the local repository will be deleted by the updater after integration.\r\n- All of the above can be done by the updater using new or updated `ApplyUpdate.xml` commands.\r\n- Integration mode will be available in the package manager dialog as a dropdown of the install button for any package that is tagged as `Sample`.\r\n- Further investigation and concept work is likely required for this issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/443/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/442","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/442/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/442/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/442/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/pull/442","id":191792373,"number":442,"title":"Better

by `Camera`, which exposes some higher-level config on this.\r\n- Consider introducing both in Camera and rendering pass, where the rendering pass rect is relative to the Camera viewport rect, which is relative to the target size (screen or rendering target).\r\n- Unlike [OpenGL viewports](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24538310/the-difference-between-glortho-and-glviewport-in-opengl), a camera viewport would merely specify a (relative) rectangular area to render to, without actually scaling any of the rendered contents. Matrix specs / target size will need to be adjusted accordingly.\r\n- Automatically scaling rendered contents to a different resolution is a different issue, see #151","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/433/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/432","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/432/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/432/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/432/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/432","id":187554238,"number":432,"title":"Turn \"Steering\" Into a Sample Project","user":{"login":"ilexp","id":14859411,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/14859411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp","html_url":"https://github.com/ilexp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":285976390,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Breaking%20Change","name":"Breaking Change","color":"fad8c7","default":false},{"id":271580333,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Package","name":"Package","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":48735364,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Task","name":"Task","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2/labels","id":856226,"number":2,"title":"General","description":"Improving the existing functionality of Duality without creating whole new modules or systems.","creator":{"login":"AdamsLair","id":5013908,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5013908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"open_issues":66,"closed_issues":237,"state":"open","created_at":"2014-11-06T17:02:30Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T18:50:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-11-06T10:48:38Z","updated_at":"2016-11-19T08:51:48Z","closed_at":"2016-11-18T21:03:52Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"### Summary\r\n\r\nThe Steering plugin is not as generic and re-usable as it could be and it behaves more like a demonstration than a polished product.
