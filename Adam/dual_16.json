The more things you rely on, the easier the test will break unconditionally due to core updates, and the more maintenance it requires.\n- **Prefer custom Types** for testing generalized behavior. When testing Component logic, write a custom Test Component rather than using SpriteRenderer, etc.\n- **Focus on fixed spec areas** when writing new tests.

This means all\nexisting files are only upgraded not replaced (this is a minor release\nnot a major release).\n\nAs a matter of fact, there is no directory for the 4.5 framework there\nis only a directory for the 4.0 version (this directory being 4.0.309\n[not sure where it's located sorry])\n\nI have done many similar upgrades at my current job. From framework 4.0\nto 4.5 and between C++ toolsets (toolset v10.0 to toolset v11.0)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/112","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/112/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/112/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/112/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/112","id":39432906,"number":112,"title":"Forum unreachable","user":{"login":"SirePi","id":5575967,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5575967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirePi","html_url":"https://github.com/SirePi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirePi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirePi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirePi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirePi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirePi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirePi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirePi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirePi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SirePi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-08-04T15:44:30Z","updated_at":"2014-08-04T16:19:27Z","closed_at":"2014-08-04T15:55:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The forum now redirects to http://duality.adamslair.net/forum/ which gives a 404 error.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/111","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/111/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/111/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/111/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/111","id":38522735,"number":111,"title":"Fonts do not load correctly from file","user":{"login":"FlaxenFlash","id":3677577,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3677577?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlaxenFlash","html_url":"https://github.com/FlaxenFlash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlaxenFlash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlaxenFlash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlaxenFlash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlaxenFlash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlaxenFlash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlaxenFlash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlaxenFlash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlaxenFlash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlaxenFlash/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48735356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":48735419,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Core","name":"Core","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-07-23T12:06:59Z","updated_at":"2014-07-30T17:39:56Z","closed_at":"2014-07-23T21:17:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I was having a problem when loading multiple fonts in the same scene where seemingly random fonts would not load. I tracked it down to this method in Font.cs:\n\n```\npublic static FontFamily LoadFontFamilyFromMemory(byte[] memory)\n{\n    FontFamily result = null;\n    GCHandle handle = GCHandle.Alloc(memory, GCHandleType.Pinned);\n    try\n    {\n        IntPtr fontMemPtr = handle.AddrOfPinnedObject();\n        fontManager.AddMemoryFont(fontMemPtr, memory.Length);\n        result = fontManager.Families[fontManager.Families.Length - 1];\n    }\n    finally\n    {\n        handle.Free();\n    }\n\n    loadedFontRegistry[result.Name] = result;\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nThe method seems to make the assumption that a newly added font will be the last font in the list. On stepping through the code however I noticed that the fonts were being stored alphabetically. If you load a font beginning with D, followed by a font beginning with C, result actually gets assigned the font beginning with D because it is the last item in the list and so the font beginning with C is never added to the loadedFontRegistry. \nI took a stab at fixing it myself but too much of the surrounding code works on the same assumption and I'm not familiar enough with the context this exists in well enough to understand the side effects of the changes I would have had to make.\n\nPotentially important context to this is that I am loading two fonts that have been serialised as resources on another machine. The original fonts are not installed on this machine and the fonts do not have links to a ttf in the media folder to fall back on so that are being loaded from the serialised customFamilyData.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/111/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/110","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/110/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/110/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/110/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/110","id":38520481,"number":110,"title":"When setting gameObject parent to itself StackOverflow exception when adding to scene","user":{"login":"Andrea","id":3103,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrea","html_url":"https://github.com/Andrea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrea/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48735356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":48735419,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Core","name":"Core","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":48735612,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Usability","name":"Usability","color":"d4c5f9","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-07-23T11:30:55Z","updated_at":"2014-07-23T20:18:29Z","closed_at":"2014-07-23T20:18:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi there\n\nA little bit of a convoluted explanation I think a failing test is better\n\n``` csharp\n        [Test]\n        public void When_set_Parent_as_self_then_should_not_throw()\n        {\n            var scene = new Scene();\n\n            var staticGameObject = new GameObject(\"static\");\n            staticGameObject.Parent = staticGameObject;\n\n            scene.AddObject(staticGameObject);

This is not overridable by explicit unwrapping behavior.\n  - If it's applied to a class, all occurrences of it will be affected.\n  - If it's applied to a field, the stored object will be affected. \n  - Special case: If that stored object is an ICollection, all of it's elements will be affected.\n    - This does NOT mean all of the collections fields will be affected, just the objects that are to be considered elements of the collection, i.e. objects with collection.Contains(obj) being equal to true.\n    - The same holds true for collections of collections. And what about dictionaries and other key-value collections? That sounds messy.\n    - Also, calling Contains is not a good idea, as it might be a \"non-const\" operation for some collections.\n    - Better idea: Pass the effect of that field on as long as there is an unbroken chain of deeply-cloned objects from the current object to the one that was directly affected by the field attribute.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/103","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/103/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/103/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/103/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/103","id":36890550,"number":103,"title":"Issue when trying to assign a GameObject field wrapped inside another class on a component in a prefab","user":{"login":"FlaxenFlash","id":3677577,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3677577?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlaxenFlash","html_url":"https://github.com/FlaxenFlash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlaxenFlash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlaxenFlash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlaxenFlash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlaxenFlash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlaxenFlash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlaxenFlash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlaxenFlash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlaxenFlash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlaxenFlash/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48735419,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Core","name":"Core","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":48735612,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Usability","name":"Usability","color":"d4c5f9","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-07-01T13:09:17Z","updated_at":"2014-07-04T09:40:05Z","closed_at":"2014-07-01T13:59:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Assigning a GameObject when handling an AssignFieldError does not create a link in the  scene if the GameObject is wrapped in a class on a component in a prefab.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1.Create the following component:\n\n```\n[Serializable]\n    public class TestClass : Component\n    {\n        public GameObject Target { get;
