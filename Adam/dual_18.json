Right now, there is a lot of redundant data stored in the Xml Serialization data structure, even in the context of a self-descriptive data format.\n- In order to make those Xml files more readable to humans, this should change.\n- The old format needs to be supported as well, for backwards-compatibility. Only loading, though. Saving can use the fresh, new format.\n- In order to pull off some of these changes, switch from using the stream-based XmlReader to the document-based approach using XmlDocument. There is no disadvantage to this change and a lot of code will be much simpler.\n  - Keep in mind that Formatters are built around a streamed concept and this still needs to be submitted to.\n  - Reading or writing multiple objects sequentially should be entirely possible.\n  - Actually, each root call to WriteObject or ReadObject should be considered a \"stream-atomic\" operation for all Formatters.\n    - Write Unit Tests for this behavior.\n    - Determine root calls by recursive counter, or just change the Formatter class API to use a public \"root\" version of these calls and virtual protected non-root versions of it with a different name.\n    - Fix BinaryFormatter to properly use BeginOperation / EndOperation regarding this concept.\n    - Fix BinaryFormatter to clean its stream data after such operation and also write the header again, etc.\n    - Implement the same behavior in the new XmlFormatter.\n- All of this needs to be done to both the regular XmlFormatter as well as the XmlMetaFormatter.\n## Disclaimer:\n- Always keep in mind that redundancy can _only_ be removed, if it exists _within_ the scope of the Xml document itself!\n- Removing field types from class / object nodes, because their parent Type could be used to derive them is NOT a valid option, because these can only be derived by reflecting over known Duality Types. This is an information that isn't available based on the Xml document alone and thus shouldn't be considered generally available.\n## Proposed changes:\n1. **Rejected:** ~~Ignore case sensitivity in boolean values.~~ Obey the default Xml behavior in .Net.\n2. **Done:** Remove Array Length parameter and derive dynamically from element count. It will still be allowed as optional parameter. Elements without matching Xml Elements will keep the default value.\n3. Child nodes of Arrays shouldn't need to specify their type, as it is already defined implicitly by the parent node.\n   1. Don't worry about the parent node not being able to resolve its type. If it doesn't its child nodes won't either anyway - resolving an Array Type is trivial when the base Type is known.\n   2. However, child nodes need to be able to override their Type specified implicitly by the Array. This is necessary for polymorphism: Just imagine Component[] or object[].\n4. For primitive Arrays, the XmlFormatter may choose to use comma-separated lists instead of child nodes.\n   1. This also counts for byte[], but only below a certain length.\n   2. However, string and char aren't allowed to do that, because of all the double escaping nightmare. Xml needs to escape strings anyway, but due to internal string processing / splitting / trimming, there would be _another_ layer of escaping. Just don't do that.\n5. \"surrogate\" and \"custom\" attributes should be synonymous. Only custom should be used in the future.\n6. If a \"custom\" node contains only body or only header, unwrap it. \n   1. To distinguish between them, allow three values for \"custom\": \"none\", \"body\" and \"header\"\n   2. \"none\" is the same as\"false\" and \"body\" is the same as \"true\".\n7. **Rejected:** ~~If a Type or surrogate Type implements a newly created Duality.Serialization.IStringLiteralConvertible method, it should be allowed to be saved and parsed as / from a string literal. This will be useful for never-changing common Types like Vector3 or ColorRGBA.~~ Requires Reflection data to be solvable.\n8. **Rejected:** ~~Get rid of the dataType Struct / Class / Array distinction for XML, because this can be derived from the document structure. Simply look for nodes without a \"dataType\", but with a \"type\" attribute.~~ Requires Reflection data to be solvable in all cases.\n9. **Done:** Change anonymous node name from \"object\" to something else, because not all of them are actually \"objects\".\n10. When saving an XML, omit the IDs of all objects that are not referenced anywhere.\n\nWrapping this up: Use the Xml document structure to derive information instead of relying on each node to specify everything itself.\n## Ideas how it all might look like:\n\n```\n<_items type=\"System.Single[]\" id=\"715955234\">1, 0.75, 0.5, 0</_items>\n```\n\n```\n<_items type=\"System.Int32[]\" id=\"715955234\">10, 5, 0</_items>\n```\n\n```\n<_items type=\"System.String[]\" id=\"715955234\">\n  <node>Hello World</node>\n  <node>This is a \"test\" string</node>\n</_items>\n```\n\n```\n<pos type=\"OpenTK.Vector3\">0, 100, 500</pos>\n```\n\n```\n<_items type=\"Duality.Resources.Pixmap+Layer[]\" id=\"2896774178\">\n  <node id=\"3086941652\" custom=\"body\">\n    <version dataType=\"Int\">3</version>\n    <pixelData type=\"System.Byte[]\" id=\"1420745160\">iVBORw0...KGgoAA</pixelData>\n  </node>\n</_items>\n```\n\n```\n<identifier type=\"System.Guid\" custom=\"header\">QntHxreDN0ecirNs9q3xqA==</identifier>\n```\n\n```\n<_items type=\"System.Guid[]\" id=\"715955234\">\n  <node custom=\"header\">QntHxreDN0ecirNs9q3xqA==</node>\n  <node custom=\"header\">QntHxreDN0ecirNs9q3xqA==</node>\n</_items>\n```\n\n```\n<_items type=\"OpenTK.Vector2[]\" id=\"715955234\">\n  <node>10, 17.5</node>\n  <node>0.5, 1.5</node>\n</_items>\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/60/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/59","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/59/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/59/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/59/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/59","id":24965255,"number":59,"title":"Support for spline Animation","user":{"login":"AdamsLair","id":5013908,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5013908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48735419,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Core","name":"Core","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":48735357,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":76590897,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Non-Critical","name":"Non-Critical","color":"fef2c0","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-01-02T14:11:43Z","updated_at":"2014-03-07T11:21:18Z","closed_at":"2014-03-07T11:21:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"- The currently implemented AnimationTrack<T> is hardcoded to do simple linear interpolation between keyframes.\n- With the current code design, there is no way of adding other implementations.\n- Add more interpolation modes to AnimationTrack via enum and different GetValue implementations.\n  - LinearInterpolation\n  - SplineInterpolation\n- Some of those interpolation modes may require additional GenericOperator shortcut implementations in order to reduce overhead.

Adam\n\nTo reproduce this, open Project View for example, and pull it away from the main Duality window so that it is floating, then try and drag the window around. DockPanel used to draw a drag preview rectangle of where the window will go when the mouse is released. It no longer does that. Additionally, the dock icons no longer appear, so it's impossible to re-dock a window that's been detached. \n\nAnother problem that is potentially related is that we're getting pretty bad performance now when dragging objects around inside the editor when any treeview window is open, and the treeview contains a reasonably large number of nodes.
