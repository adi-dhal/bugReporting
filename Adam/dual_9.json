Summary\n\nDuality currently supports Circle-, Polygon- and Loop Shapes. There is no way to specify a shape that is not a closed loop, which can be unwieldy at times and also gets in the way of issue #279. Extend the physics backend and Duality glue code to support Chain Shapes to fix this.\n#### Analysis\n- The Farseer Physics backend currently does not support Chain Shapes, but Farseer 3.5 does. It is likely that Chain Shape support could be merged into the Duality-specific version of Farseer, potentially replacing the Loop Shape entirely.\n- A Loop Shape is actually a special case of a Chain Shape. The physics backend might only need support for the chain shape case, while the Duality glue code could use it in one or the other way.\n- There needs to be editor support for Chain Shapes. It is likely that this could share a lot of code with Loop Shape editing.\n#### Next Steps\n- [x] Merge back ChainShape to Farseer backend, replacing LoopShape.\n- [x] Update Duality to internally use the physics ChainShape for creating LoopShapes.\n- [x] Introduce a new ChainShape type to Duality.\n- [x] Implement editor support for ChainShapes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/330/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/329","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/329/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/329/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/329/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/329","id":156122669,"number":329,"title":"Investigate the Potential Unification of Serialization and Cloning","user":{"login":"ilexp","id":14859411,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/14859411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp","html_url":"https://github.com/ilexp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":76591442,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Arguable","name":"Arguable","color":"fad8c7","default":false},{"id":285976390,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Breaking%20Change","name":"Breaking Change","color":"fad8c7","default":false},{"id":366756736,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Cleanup","name":"Cleanup","color":"d4c5f9","default":false},{"id":48735419,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Core","name":"Core","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":48735364,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Task","name":"Task","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":278510148,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Unit%20Tests","name":"Unit Tests","color":"fef2c0","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/3","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/milestone/3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/3/labels","id":856240,"number":3,"title":"Future","description":"New systems and modules requiring a significant amount of long-term effort.","creator":{"login":"AdamsLair","id":5013908,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5013908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"open_issues":11,"closed_issues":7,"state":"open","created_at":"2014-11-06T17:12:07Z","updated_at":"2017-07-01T19:45:04Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-05-21T21:32:20Z","updated_at":"2016-05-22T05:41:06Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"#### Summary\n\nCloning and Serialization are closely related systems, yet the co-exist distinctly and introduce technical debt while preventing certain optimizations from being equally useful in both cases. Investigate (once again) whether it would be viable to unify them.\n#### Analysis\n- The main reason the cloning system exists are:\n  - Ability to target an existing object graph.\n  - Ownership analysis, e.g. not dragging _everything_ into the cloning / serialization graph, but determining exactly what is required.\n- Given the above points, the cloning system could be interpreted as a feature-wise superset of serialization. Can the findings and algorithms from cloning be used to improve serialization to the point that it can replace cloning entirely?\n- The complete set of Cloning system unit tests could be kept to verify cloning-via-serialization still works as expected. Some corner cases might fail, which will have to be re-investigated for their severity.\n- Performance in general will be an important consideration.\n  - Cloning doesn't require metadata like (version-safe) serialization does. A special serializer would likely be required to achieve comparable performance. On the plus side, that same serializer could then also be used for regular serialization in game releases, where versioning and source control safety is no longer that big of a concern.\n  - Still, serialization performs one step that cloning technically doesn't need: Writing everything into a stream and parsing it again later. For Prefabs, the main use case, this could be eased by caching the intermediate stream after loading.\n  - On the plus side, cloning might also become a bit simpler with that stream as a clear separation line in the middle. No explicit object mapping, etc.\n  - The again, serialization could also become slower due to the fact that it would now, being unified, require ownership detection and become a two-step process as well. The ownership analysis won't create object instances though, but instead map objects to serialization IDs.\n\nIt might be a good idea to not approach this unless triggered by a specific need or task complex. Cloning and serialization are both stable right now. \"Never change a running system.\"\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/329/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/328","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/328/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/328/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/328/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/328","id":155096808,"number":328,"title":"Reduce Struct Array Serialization Verbosity","user":{"login":"ilexp","id":14859411,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/14859411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp","html_url":"https://github.com/ilexp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48735419,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Core","name":"Core","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":48735364,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Task","name":"Task","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":278510148,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Unit%20Tests","name":"Unit Tests","color":"fef2c0","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2/labels","id":856226,"number":2,"title":"General","description":"Improving the existing functionality of Duality without creating whole new modules or systems.","creator":{"login":"AdamsLair","id":5013908,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5013908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"open_issues":66,"closed_issues":237,"state":"open","created_at":"2014-11-06T17:02:30Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T18:50:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-05-16T18:59:31Z","updated_at":"2016-05-21T11:27:10Z","closed_at":"2016-05-21T11:27:10Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"#### Summary\n\nIn the course of issue #279, it became apparent that both XML and Binary serialization write a lot of unnecessary information when serializing a large amount of structs. Investigate ways to reduce the amount of written data in the case of struct and struct array serialization.\n#### Analysis\n- While `null` values can be serialized easily, there currently is no special case for `default(T)` struct values. They could be omitted safely just as well.\n  - `XmlSerializer`: Just don't populate the current struct element in `WriteStruct`.\n  - `BinarySerializer`: Use the skip-field array to skip all fields.\n  - Be careful with regard to surrogate and custom serialization.\n  - Investigate: Could this be implemented in the same spot where reference types are checked for null?\n- Theoretically, this could be extended towards omitting `default(T)` fields of a struct value.\n  - Doesn't work for classes, as they can have arbitrary constructors, so their field's default is unknown.\n  - May result in less readable XML. Could be considered for binary serialization.\n- Add unit tests that check specifically for potential problems with the omission of values.\n#### Attachments\n\nSample excerpt of verbose XML struct

Summary\n\nThe logging system is mostly fine right now, but its API is also the result of organic growth. Use the v3.0 major version step as an opportunity to cleanup and refactor the public API, as well as make some overdue changes to its internals.\n#### Analysis\n- Log formatting methods could move into a distinct static `LogFormat` class.\n- Default logs could be moved to a static `Logs` class, making `Log` a completely non-static class.\n- Provide an easy way to introduce custom global logs, maybe using a generic `Logs.Get<T>` interface using static generic class storage internally.\n- Make indentation a property of log outputs, rather than logs or log entries, get rid of `SharedState`.\n  - Could be expressed as `ILogOutput` Push / Pop indentation API.\n- `LogEntry` should not contain `source` log or `context` references. Consider making them part of the `ILogOutput` API instead.\n  - For editor support, remove the core `InMemoryLogOutput` and replace it with an editor-specific log output that also stores source log and context information in addition to the `LogEntry`. \n  - That way, core logs will be strictly serializable and more lightweight, while the editor can add as much diagnostic info as it wants.\n- Unify visual and text logging APIs, or at least make sure they're similar enough so they don't require their own \"learning curve\".\n- Use UTC Timestamps, update LogView to convert them back to local time.\n- Make `Log` and `ILogOutput` implementations thread-safe, if they aren't yet.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/326","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/326/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/326/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/326/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/326","id":153674294,"number":326,"title":"Reduce

Summary\r\n\r\nInvestigate where the render pipeline could be improved with regard to reducing virtual method calls, class (vs. struct) usage and overall OOP chit-chat.\r\n#### Analysis\r\n- This will require a reliable rendering benchmark with a lot of objects. _Edit:_ Moved the details to issue #549.\r\n- **Each `ICmpRenderer` has its own `IsVisible` call.** 95% of them just check for the visibility groups and / or the screen overlay flag being set, followed by checking if they're in bound-radius range of the viewport.\r\n  - Would it be an improvement to instead just expose a group filter flags property and do all the group and radius-culling checks in a tight loop inside the render pipeline?\r\n  - Every interface API usage is a virtual call. Reduce them to an absolute minimum.\r\n    - `ICmpRenderer.GetCullingData` out-returns a struct with all information required to decide whether it will be visible to a device or not. Can be invoked to directly write into some internal RawList array store, which can then be batch-processed easily.\r\n    - Bonus: `GetCullingData` only needs to be called once per frame per object and its results can be re-used by every camera and rendering pass.\r\n    - `ICmpRenderer.Draw` does the rendering like it does right now.\r\n- **There are a lot of interface calls involved.** See if it is possible to get rid of some of them, or transform per-object calls to one \"group\" call for N objects.\r\n  - In general, prefer one call with N objects over N calls for each object individually.\r\n- **CalcZOffset takes a lot of time for large vertex arrays** and could be avoided entirely.\r\n  - Tilemaps and similar renderers can sometimes submit thousands of vertices. Calculating the depth offset of 4096 vertices takes about 0.1 ms, which isn't critical, but very unfortunate, given its redundant nature.\r\n  - Most of the time, the renderer has a perfectly clear idea of the representative Z offset of a submitted drawbatch. Why not provide the API to specify it?\r\n  - When not specifying it, `CalcZOffset` could be used as a fallback.\r\n- **Don't sacrifice usability on the game side.**\r\n  - `ICmpRenderer` should still act \"per-object\" and expose one draw method per object.\r\n  - However, it would be possible to introduce an optional `ICmpMultiRenderer` interface where one draw method is called with an array of all queried objects of the matching type is provided. \r\n    - If there is a significant performance improvement, this could be a neat middle ground between having a full \"grouped Component\" and having one Component per object.\r\n    - ~~With the multi-renderer interface in mind, it might make sense to also refactor the `IRendererVisibilityStrategy` interface, so the query method actually provides guaranteed type-sorted renderer arrays / RawLists in some form.~~\r\n      - ~~Keep the overhead low. Potentially even keep the \"exposed RawList\" approach, but enforce specifying \"type sections\" inside that list.~~\r\n    - ~~_If_ this shows a notable improvement (yet to be shown), we could also go a similar route for updates and provide a matching `ICmpMultiUpdatable` interface.~~\r\n- etc. / investigate\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/326/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/325","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/325/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/325/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/325/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/325","id":153642396,"number":325,"title":"Provide UV Offset Values as a per-Texture Material Property","user":{"login":"ilexp","id":14859411,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/14859411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp","html_url":"https://github.com/ilexp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":76591442,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Arguable","name":"Arguable","color":"fad8c7","default":false},{"id":48735419,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Core","name":"Core","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":48735357,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":402199980,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Rendering","name":"Rendering","color":"d4c5f9","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/6","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/milestone/6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/6/labels","id":1581240,"number":6,"title":"v3.0","description":"Everything that will be part of the major v3.0 Duality release.","creator":{"login":"ilexp","id":14859411,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/14859411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp","html_url":"https://github.com/ilexp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":25,"closed_issues":30,"state":"open","created_at":"2016-02-13T16:51:45Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T17:29:53Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-05-08T07:45:07Z","updated_at":"2016-12-24T09:41:03Z","closed_at":"2016-12-24T09:41:03Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"#### Summary\n\nAs described [here](http://forum.adamslair.net/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=812), there is currently no easy and convenient way to assign a UV offset to a texture.\n#### Analysis\n- While this could be done as a per-Renderer property that adjusts vertex generation, a preferable way seems to be having an additional Material property per-Texture.

Potentially add editor infrastructure for getting notified of AssetManager operations?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/321/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/320","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/320/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/320/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/320/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/pull/320","id":151907430,"number":320,"title":"Adding XAdvance","user":{"login":"mika76","id":229311,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/229311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mika76","html_url":"https://github.com/mika76","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mika76/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mika76/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mika76/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mika76/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mika76/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mika76/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mika76/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mika76/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mika76/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48735419,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Core","name":"Core","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":48735357,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2/labels","id":856226,"number":2,"title":"General","description":"Improving the existing functionality of Duality without creating whole new modules or systems.","creator":{"login":"AdamsLair","id":5013908,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5013908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"open_issues":66,"closed_issues":237,"state":"open","created_at":"2014-11-06T17:02:30Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T18:50:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":10,"created_at":"2016-04-29T16:10:02Z","updated_at":"2016-05-05T20:15:20Z","closed_at":"2016-05-05T20:15:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/pulls/320","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/pull/320","diff_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/pull/320.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/pull/320.patch"},"body":"Here's my attempt :smile: \n\nI've Added the AdvanceX property and moved the calculation of it to the font renderer instead of the update kernings method.

However, not all importers (can, should or do) specify an export method, and not in all cases this export is symmetrical with regard to a previous import.\n#### Analysis\n- Don't rely on simulated export.\n- Introduce a distinct way to determine which `Source/Media` files belong to a given Resource.\n  - A combination of AssetManagement API and data attachment hints could do the trick.\n  - Attaching a source file name hint per-Resource could be done at [this](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/blob/master/DualityEditor/AssetManagement/Import/AssetImportOperation.cs#L204-L214) part of an `AssetImportOperation`.\n  - Hint file paths should be relative to the [directory of the Resource when mapped to `Source/Media`](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/blob/master/DualityEditor/AssetManagement/AssetManager.cs#L121-L129), so they don't need to be updated when moving the Resource around.\n  - Renaming a Resource would require to rename these hints as well, along with the existing `Source/Media` files that are already synced / renamed anyway, see [here](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/blob/master/DualityEditor/FileEventManager.cs#L487-L503).\n  - Will need to load and save the affected Resource, but since renaming requires selecting it first, it's likely already loaded and ready to be saved.\n- The existing simulated export can still serve as a fallback when there is no mapping data available as part of the AssetInfo.\n- Existing Export-Edit-ReImport workflow remains unaffected, since file change events trigger ReImport in a way that resolves the affected Resource by querying available importers, which don't care about hints regarding previous imports. The new import operation will overwrite previous hints automatically, so no explicit syncing is required either.\n- Look into code a little more to figure out the details.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/318","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/318/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/318/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/318/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/318","id":150680382,"number":318,"title":"Allow to Pass Temporary per-Operation Data From AssetImporter Prepare to Import","user":{"login":"ilexp","id":14859411,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/14859411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp","html_url":"https://github.com/ilexp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48735426,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Editor","name":"Editor","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":48735357,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":76590897,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Non-Critical","name":"Non-Critical","color":"fef2c0","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2/labels","id":856226,"number":2,"title":"General","description":"Improving the existing functionality of Duality without creating whole new modules or systems.","creator":{"login":"AdamsLair","id":5013908,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5013908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"open_issues":66,"closed_issues":237,"state":"open","created_at":"2014-11-06T17:02:30Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T18:50:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-04-24T16:52:10Z","updated_at":"2016-04-24T16:55:15Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"#### Summary\n\nAs described in [this comment](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/285#issuecomment-213997774) from issue #285, there are cases where the preparation step of an importer already needs to parse some of the imported files in order to figure out which source files will be used.
