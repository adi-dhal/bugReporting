Let's see if some of them can be introduced back into Duality:\n## Quick Merge / Fix\n\nMostly trivial merges that don't need much work to fit in just well.\n- [x] Allow screen resolution changes at runtime. https://github.com/BraveSirAndrew/duality/commit/29b28280559a53d742777ab2338c4fcbea07ea7d\n- [x] QueryRectGlobal Bugfix. Apparently, it makes a difference which AABB constructor is used. Doublecheck the actual behavior. https://github.com/BraveSirAndrew/duality/commit/9e151fbc5e8c2dd26d475931cbdde592b8105fdf\n  - The difference is actually center-origin vs. topleft origin in the rect specified via parameters. This can't be changed without altering Duality behavior and is in fact not a simple fix, but rather a \"different overload\" of the same functionality. The same behavior can be achieved by offsetting the worldCoord parameter by -size/2. Keeping the method as is, because topleft+size is the intuitive way to specify rectangles.\n- [x] CamView Keyboard shortcuts \n  https://github.com/BraveSirAndrew/duality/commit/e12fd9946a705213f72ca3dbec19b7b42cf85552\n- [x] Switch from List to HashSet inside GameObjectManager for performance reasons \n  https://github.com/BraveSirAndrew/duality/commit/5c557938b7198a2aa09cb6e882190bd68dcdc6c0\n- [x] Check Bugfix \n  https://github.com/BraveSirAndrew/duality/commit/cc0c5ae15774e6b35b31fce9d91bc72ffa70a0e5\n- [x] Check Bugfix \n  https://github.com/BraveSirAndrew/duality/commit/effbcb568a89cdc3cef52fa4c46e81f7685d2e24\n- [x] Remove the \"Are You Sure\" dialog on closing when there are no changes anyway \n  https://github.com/BraveSirAndrew/duality/commit/61249ae7dbf0cbcbb1e0c9a8c98755c65a221240\n- [x] Startup performance tweaking related to CamView BgColorDialog \n  https://github.com/BraveSirAndrew/duality/commit/6942f49ffb64aa1e6fa9b4aa9d09d9a6ccbea317\n- [x] FileHash performance improvements \n  https://github.com/BraveSirAndrew/duality/commit/6df39273f5356c8868acf1748d3877af6d5ff868\n- [x] Startup performance tweaks for .Net 4.5 (research this first)\n  https://github.com/BraveSirAndrew/duality/commit/02f282e70bbfae4fdb24f32518587ca4a9941962\n  - Moved [here](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/106)\n## Needs Work\n\nUseful stuff that needs to be modified or partially re-evaluated before merging.\n- [x] Support for games with a fixed aspect ratio via viewport scaling: https://github.com/BraveSirAndrew/duality/commit/2cb48ed12a585e39168ed3f0749e0284ecd45248\n  - Doesn't work for all cases with this implementation. Definitely a thing that Duality should have, but this will need more work. Moved to separate issue.\n- [x] Look into why loading Scenes without initializing them can trigger loading of Prefabs.\n  - Can't reproduce. Look out for it in the future, but may have been fixed inadvertedly due to the big version gap.\n- [x] Pixmap Performance Improvements https://github.com/BraveSirAndrew/duality/commit/d59d14e7cf9132c3bcba6139f566eba33aafe801\n- [x] Introduce a way for Duality to detect whether its application is in the background / unfocused. Think of features like Auto-Pause when Alt-Tabbing.\n- [x] Fonts could have an IncludeFamilyData option to allow ones created inside the editor to include all the required data within the Resource, similar to Fonts dragged into the editor from a .ttf file.\n  - Low priority, pure usability / convenience feature. There are more important things to do right now, but keep this in mind for later.\n- [x] Highlight objects when double-clicking log entries https://github.com/BraveSirAndrew/duality/commit/e20362937a55841b4d9342cdc2c90db0df295170\n- [x] Move hierarchial context menu creation to a central place. Check if this hasn't been refactored anyway in the meantime: \n  https://github.com/BraveSirAndrew/duality/commit/e282d9e1b4fd6e62e58528670080c892e4d2c560\n- [x] Use a more performant way to remove null objects / flush them at the end of the frame without re-allocating the underlying containers \n  https://github.com/BraveSirAndrew/duality/commit/54fd09f7717ff09b35d2d092e94efcbd53f2cdb6\n- [x] Consider introducing a mechanism for custom visibility checking for renderers \n  https://github.com/BraveSirAndrew/duality/commit/9ba93fea4883ee250121428e0e3576762f288a4c\n  https://github.com/BraveSirAndrew/duality/commit/32a7159727b71587c42e216d5fef0bd98e7a32e4\n- [x] Consider Camera event hooks for frame and pass completion (Custom screen capture, node editor preview, graphics debugging) \n  https://github.com/BraveSirAndrew/duality/commit/3c70e697d56a9caafcca9106f419342695c406aa\n  - Seems too specialized to introduce into the core right now. Re-evaluate later.\n- [x] Improve CamView handling of Transforms for objects that do not have renderers. Display a gizmo and make sure there is a minimum size assumed so mouse input works.\n  - Low-priority. Deal with this the next time when doing work in the CamView / CamViewState classes.\n- [x] ContentRef selection button like in Unity (Flat list with search box, no hierarchy)\n  - Moved to separate issue.\n## Future Ideas\n\nOpen for consideration. Move to separate Issues later when doing concept work.\n\n_Edit: Moved them all to separate issues_\n- [x] Refactor the CamViewState to allow introducing custom actions: https://github.com/BraveSirAndrew/duality/commit/ab46ccd9119e92ee68db639a3b35ee0bacbda6d3\n- [x] Introduce Guards to Duality? \n  https://github.com/BraveSirAndrew/duality/commit/aa3e925f3a63891b596b414478cca2075e2d330c\n- [x] At some point, there should be texture compression somehow \n  https://github.com/BraveSirAndrew/duality/commit/2d275ac71dbab61cddeca98b6512375bfb68c7c0\n- [x] Allow to drag around / modify RigidBody shape vertices. Likely not exactly this, but something conceptually similar: \n  https://github.com/BraveSirAndrew/duality/commit/a9ed27a7f04fc791b060ba5cd738862652ad0307\n- [x] Workspace presets: Multiple customizable docking settings for the user to quickly switch between.\n- [x] Improve Source/Media folder handling.

Hence, it is easier to make modifications to these variables from a single static class instead of going into each class to change it.\n\nChange 0/1: Refactor If Statement Conditions for GameObject Parent\n\nInstead of having comments to explain what the piece of code inside the if statement does, the block was extracted into a method with a specific name which allows a better comprehension of the actions performed.\n\nChange 0/7: Remove Middleman\n\nSince the scene is hiding internal details (Game Objects) to the rest of the world, a lot of methods are delated to the GameObjectManager class. Our solution is to remove the middleman (GameObjectManager). The scene will be able to manipulate its own list of GameObjects without having to go through the GameObjectManager. A new interface will also be implemented in order to manage GameObjects if there is any other class that needs

I guess it is because some difference between spaces/tabs in my Visual Studio.\n\nI changed the format in which the urls are stored. Original url was directly converted to Uri but also keep in the string. I am saving urls only as a strings and do same conversion right before the repository is created.
