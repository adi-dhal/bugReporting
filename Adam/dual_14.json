The font will be imported.\n- Remove Arial Black from the project.\n- Import Arial Italic in the project. It won't work and you will get the error.\n\nRestarting the editor fixes the issue, until you do it again :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/178/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/177","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/177/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/177/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/177/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/177","id":60900053,"number":177,"title":"Dual monitor crash","user":{"login":"Deviver","id":7873211,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7873211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deviver","html_url":"https://github.com/Deviver","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deviver/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deviver/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deviver/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deviver/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deviver/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deviver/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deviver/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deviver/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deviver/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48735356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":48735426,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Editor","name":"Editor","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":50803016,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Up%20For%20Grabs","name":"Up For Grabs","color":"006b75","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2/labels","id":856226,"number":2,"title":"General","description":"Improving the existing functionality of Duality without creating whole new modules or systems.","creator":{"login":"AdamsLair","id":5013908,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5013908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"open_issues":66,"closed_issues":237,"state":"open","created_at":"2014-11-06T17:02:30Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T18:50:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":10,"created_at":"2015-03-12T20:54:27Z","updated_at":"2015-03-13T17:33:54Z","closed_at":"2015-03-13T17:33:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I think I've stumbled across a bug.

This would basically allow to define the following:\n\n```\n[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Explicit)]\npublic struct Vector3\n{\n    // Regular field access\n    [FieldOffset(0)]\n    public float X;\n    [FieldOffset(4)]\n    public float Y;\n    [FieldOffset(8)]\n    public float Z;\n\n    // Convenience access\n    [FieldOffset(0)]\n    public Vector2 XY;\n}\n```\n\nSo basically replacing the `Xy` Property with a direct data access using explicit struct layouts, which would likely yield a small performance benefit when doing CPU-heavy batch operations involving this. Fields are also a little bit more flexible when it comes to out / ref usage and absolutely no functionality would be lost.\n\nAll in all, it appears that there is no good reason not to do this. Will likely change in conjunction with the [OpenTK upgrade](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/160), so breaking changes are reduced to a minimum.\n\nAnd while we're at breaking stuff anyway, this could also be a good opportunity to finally move all of this Vector math stuff out of OpenTK and into a distinct library, so Farseer and Duality can use it without depending on OpenTK, which kind of has a different purpose than defining vector math.\n\nJust some wild thoughts.

Title:** Consider Moving Editor to WPF?\n\nAs the title says - this should be considered in the future. Not an actual plan, but a rough idea for long term development.\n\nPro:\n- Getting rid of the decade old WinForms cruft.\n- Shiny new UI with styling capabilities.\n- Fully hardware accelerated rendering performance.\n- DPI independent rendering.\n- XAML and Data Binding seems really, really neat.\n\nCon:\n- Rewriting all editor UI code.\n- Rewriting the custom PropertyGrid.\n- Searching WPF equivalents for Docking, fast / virtualized TreeViews, etc.\n- Fully hardware accelerated rendering - does it interact with OpenGL performance, and can it host OpenTK GLControls? Is there any OpenTK support?\n- Startup performance.\n- \"Never change a running system\".\n- A big change that isn't really necessary to advance Duality.\n\nNot sure whether this is a good idea at all.
