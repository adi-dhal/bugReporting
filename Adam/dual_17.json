structure.\n- To remove it would decrease overall framework complexity, which is a good thing in this case.\n## Impact and Issues\n1. XmlMetaFormatter and BinaryMetaFormatter will be removed.\n2. XmlFormatter can be merged with XmlFormatterBase, and the same goes for BinaryFormatter and BinaryFormatterBase. A lot of their complexity will vanish.\n3. The editor will now longer be able to rely on the MetaFormat to rename Types and Namespaces when creating a new project.\n4. The ResourceHacker module becomes obsolete and will be removed as well. It will no longer be possible to use it for bulk renaming, etc.\n5. Different Formatters will be allowed to utilize different data structures that fit better to their kind.\n## Solutions and Thoughts\n1. Improvement\n2. Improvement\n3. This is a technical issue that needs to be dealt with. It is not possible to use temporary SerializeTypeHandlers for this purpose - because this will require the new Types to be resolvable, which isn't the case. There will be the need for some other solution.\n   - String Operations on Xml Format?\n   - New kind of operation for Formatter classes that reads from one stream, performs an operation on unresolved data, and directly writes it to a different stream? \n   - Or maybe the same with two Formatters, so each one still only operates on one stream.\n   - Or let that operation perform on a single stream with both reading and writing, so each Formatter class can handle it on its own. XmlFormatters could just find/replace on the document, BinaryFormatters could use the boundary markers to read and modify only headers, while writing other memory unchanged.\n   - Or something else. No final solution yet.\n4. Using a human-readable data format will serve the same purpose and be a lot more efficient and easy at the same time. So this will not be a problem.\n5.

I don't need to do so in a CorePlugin...\"\n- Why are Type images and Type categories in an EditorPlugin, although EditorHints allow specifying metadata within a CorePlugin?\n- Why is there a separate `DualityEditor` namespace when `Duality.Editor` would be more appropriate? Also, EditorHints could go there as well.\n## Proposed Changes\n- **Done:** Split `EditorBase` into multiple separate EditorPlugins.\n  - Probably one per module.\n- **Done:** Rename `DualityEditor` namespace to `Duality.Editor` \n  - Also, move EditorHints there.\n  - Plugin namespaces will be `Duality.Editor.Plugins.XY`\n- **Done:** Get rid of `IPropertyEditorProviders`, use Reflection instead.\n  - Introduce [PropretyEditorAssignment] attribute\n  - Can be used as a class attribute on classes deriving from PropertyEditor in order to link that editor to a specific Type (and its derivatives) to edit.\n  - Can be used as a static method attribute on classes deriving from PropertyEditor in order to provide an assignment function that determines the level of Type association for that editor based on certain parameters.\n- **Done:** Get rid of `RegisterTypeCategory` and `RegisterTypeImage` \n  - Use newly introduced EditorHints instead.\n- **Done:** If possible, get rid of `CorePluginRegistry` alltogether.\n  - With PropertyEditors, TypeImages and TypeCategories gone, what's left is as follows:\n  - **Done:** `EditorActions`: Could probably transform EditorActions to attributes, which can be assigned to static methods. Right now, that's what they are doing anyway.\n  - **Done:** `DataConverter`; Could be replaced by using class attributes on DataConverters, assigning each one a target Type.\n  - **Done:** `PreviewGenerator`: Don't even need an attribute. Just use all non-abstract classes implementing  IPreviewGenerator.\n  - **Done:** `FileImporter`: Dont' need an attribute here either. Again, just use Reflection.\n  - **Done:** `XmlCodeDoc`: Move to HelpSystem.\n  - **Done:** `DesignTimeData`: Move to `DualityEditorApp` or new helper class.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/69/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/68","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/68/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/68/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/68/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/68","id":26570596,"number":68,"title":"GraphicsContextMissingException in RenderTarget on editor restart","user":{"login":"BraveSirAndrew","id":260791,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/260791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BraveSirAndrew","html_url":"https://github.com/BraveSirAndrew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BraveSirAndrew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BraveSirAndrew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BraveSirAndrew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BraveSirAndrew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BraveSirAndrew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BraveSirAndrew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BraveSirAndrew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BraveSirAndrew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BraveSirAndrew/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48735356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":48735426,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Editor","name":"Editor","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":50803016,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Up%20For%20Grabs","name":"Up For Grabs","color":"006b75","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-01-30T02:17:37Z","updated_at":"2014-03-04T20:47:44Z","closed_at":"2014-03-04T20:47:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Steps to reproduce:\n1.
