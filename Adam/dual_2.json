While nice for some games, this [screws up a significant number of physics conversion rates](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/257) and is a somewhat arbitrary choice for most other games. Investigate whether it makes sense to switch all of Duality over to a MKS (meter-kilogram-second) scale.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\nThis issue is to be investigated and discussed. Whether or not it should be implemented still needs to be figured out. Feedback appreciated, please join the discussion in the comments.\r\n\r\n#### What that means\r\n\r\n- It will change the base units for length, time and mass to be based on meters, seconds and kilograms.\r\n- Physics conversion rates would flatline to `1.0f` for all units.\r\n- Audio conversion rates would flatline to `1.0f` for all units.\r\n- Implementing this will break all serialized and hardcoded values from the old coordinate system.\r\n- Rendering and audio would be adjusted to operate on scaled spatial units.\r\n- Changing the spatial scaling factor afterwards will not be a breaking change and could be adjusted on a per-game, per-scene or even per-camera basis.\r\n\r\n#### Things to take note of\r\n\r\n- To mimic the current relation between physics and rendering scale, the scaling factor should default to 100, meaning that one unit (meter) is going to be scaled up to span 100 pixels at 1:1 zoom.\r\n- It will be a downgrade for games or gamedevs who prefer a pixel based coordinate system, while being an upgrade for those working with physics a lot.\r\n- It will make the scale of units more intuitive. Examples:\r\n  - Before: `1.6666 pixels / frame`\r\n  - Before: `2.7777 decigram * pixels / frame²`\r\n  - After: `1 unit / second`\r\n  - After: `1 kg * units / second²`\r\n- The scaling factor could be adjusted as seen fit by the game.\r\n  - For example, a 32x32 tile based RPG could specify that one tile is 1m², defining the rendering scale as 32 and essentially using a world space coordinate system where one unit equals one tile.\r\n  - Setting a scaling factor of one would make it a pixel-based coordinate system like before, but that's not to be recommended, since physics will be less accurate while only gaining a bit of editor convenience in exchange.\r\n  - The default scaling factor should be useful / good enough that changing it could be considered advanced.\r\n\r\n#### What needs to be done\r\n\r\n- Adjust all sample project Scenes and Prefabs.\r\n  - Object positions, Transform.Pos\r\n  - Gravity\r\n  - RigidBody mass overrides\r\n  - RigidBody Joint properties\r\n  - Any property value relating to velocity, force, impulse or similar.\r\n  - Would probably be easiest to write a script that does the grunt work automatically.\r\n- Adjust all sample project code.\r\n  - Hardcoded physics-related values.\r\n  - Also distances, offsets, positions.\r\n- Adjust physics settings.\r\n  - Velocity threshold.\r\n- Adjust core code\r\n  - Absolute anchors for min-max audio ranges.\r\n- Adjust Camera and SoundListener code to use a scaling factor.\r\n  - Find a good place to store the default of that scaling factor, as it needs to be used by the Camera View, as well as all other runtime-generated Cameras and SoundListeners.\r\n  - A global default might be a good start.\r\n- Figure out how to auto-create a SpriteRenderer, and similar situations.\r\n  - The SpriteRenderers rect will be set automatically, but the right size will no longer be the image size in pixels, but a world space size that, given the scaling factor, would be rendering as the image size.\r\n  - That kind of conversion might show up more often. Would be good if there was a somewhat common place to ask for the \"current\" (whatever that means) scaling factor.\r\n  - Also, what happens when creating a sprite prefab in a project with scaling factor A and re-using it in a project with scaling factor B? Its rect will be off. Is there a way around this? Is it likely to be a real-world problem?\r\n\r\n#### How to proceed\r\n\r\n- Discuss the pros and cons of this potential change.\r\n- Figure out pitfalls and how to solve them.\r\n- If actually deemed a likely enough improvement, branch off of the `develop-v3.0` branch to implement a prototype.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/541/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/540","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/540/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/540/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/540/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/540","id":236245561,"number":540,"title":"Extract

While it is possible to [add a Roslyn Analyzer to report this as an error](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/298) at some point, a more constructive solution would be to provide an `.editorconfig` file that automatically adjusts the IDE setting to indent with tabs for this project.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\n- EditorConfig support is integrated natively into VS starting VS 2017.

general-purpose constant. One thing that this makes impossible is using child objects as sensors. Favoring control over restricting users to a safe subset, this should be removed.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\n- Changing this behavior would normally be a breaking change and warrant being on the v3.0 milestone, but thankfully `IgnoreParent` is serialized - which means that nothing will change for existing scenes.\r\n- It would make sense to activate `IgnoreParent` once in the RigidBodies `AddToGameObject` handler, so objects start off with a good default both in the editor and at runtime.\r\n- Double-check whether this breaks any of the physics samples. If it does, investigate why and move this to the v3.0 milestone when necessary.\r\n- Add a physics sample where a GameObject uses child objects as sensors.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/531/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/530","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/530/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/530/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/530/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/pull/530","id":225471680,"number":530,"title":"RigidBody Vertex Editor","user":{"login":"YMRYMR","id":25836331,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/25836331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YMRYMR","html_url":"https://github.com/YMRYMR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YMRYMR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YMRYMR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YMRYMR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YMRYMR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YMRYMR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YMRYMR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YMRYMR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YMRYMR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YMRYMR/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48735426,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Editor","name":"Editor","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":48735357,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":76590897,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Non-Critical","name":"Non-Critical","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":48735612,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Usability","name":"Usability","color":"d4c5f9","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2/labels","id":856226,"number":2,"title":"General","description":"Improving the existing functionality of Duality without creating whole new modules or systems.","creator":{"login":"AdamsLair","id":5013908,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5013908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"open_issues":66,"closed_issues":237,"state":"open","created_at":"2014-11-06T17:02:30Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T18:50:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-05-01T16:55:27Z","updated_at":"2017-06-17T18:25:14Z","closed_at":"2017-06-17T18:25:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/pulls/530","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/pull/530","diff_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/pull/530.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/pull/530.patch"},"body":"### Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n_This is a reminder on a few important traits of your Pull Request. **Do not add this to your description**._\r\n\r\n- Have you read the [**wiki article** on contribution](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/wiki/How-to-Contribute)? : Yes\r\n- Have you done your changes in a **PR-specific branch**?

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen the package manager enters a state where two different versions of the same package are installed, it will start an uninstall / reinstall loop that can only be fixed by manually removing the conflicting package.\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce\r\n\r\n- Initialize a Duality installation with the following package config: [PackageConfig.txt](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/files/966654/PackageConfig.txt)\r\n- In the package manager dialog, install the Tilemaps Sample package. **Do not** update any other package first.\r\n- After applying the update, a restart loop will be entered.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\n- Avoid conflicting dependency situations by keeping packages up-to-date and updating before installing a package that requires a newer version.\r\n- Manually resolving conflicts by removing duplicate packages from the local repository and editing the package config xml.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\n- Installing the Tilemaps sample package above requires newer Duality packages than are installed in the repro case.\r\n- This will lead to duplicate versions of those packages being installed in the local repo.\r\n- Upon restart, Duality will attempt to remove the old versions of those packages, as they are not registered in the package config anymore after the update.\r\n- This uninstall however [removes all package config entries](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/blob/d478ea9e8be17da8a2a052133e336f1b7b8e26e0/Source/Editor/DualityEditor/PackageManagement/PackageManager.cs#L1170), regardless of their version.\r\n- As a result, packages will be re-installed on the next editor restart.\r\n- Unclear: It appears that different versions of the dependency package will be installed in an alternating sequence. Not entirely sure why this happens or how it interacts with the other issues.\r\n  - Check what happens when installing a package that depends on an old version of an already-installed package.\r\n  - There may be a similar issue on installs, where [any other version is replaced](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/blob/d478ea9e8be17da8a2a052133e336f1b7b8e26e0/Source/Editor/DualityEditor/PackageManagement/PackageManager.cs#L1183) by a newly installed package version, regardless of whether it is newer or not.\r\n- This might be a good opportunity to start writing PackageManager tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/527/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/526","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/526/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/526/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/526/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/526","id":224487294,"number":526,"title":"Tileset Editor draws tiles without being in focus","user":{"login":"ChristianGreiner","id":6233308,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6233308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianGreiner","html_url":"https://github.com/ChristianGreiner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianGreiner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianGreiner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianGreiner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianGreiner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianGreiner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianGreiner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianGreiner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianGreiner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristianGreiner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48735356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":271580333,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Package","name":"Package","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":50803016,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Up%20For%20Grabs","name":"Up For Grabs","color":"006b75","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2/labels","id":856226,"number":2,"title":"General","description":"Improving the existing functionality of Duality without creating whole new modules or systems.","creator":{"login":"AdamsLair","id":5013908,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5013908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"open_issues":66,"closed_issues":237,"state":"open","created_at":"2014-11-06T17:02:30Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T18:50:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-04-26T14:27:47Z","updated_at":"2017-04-26T16:13:12Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"![https://gfycat.com/SpottedInfatuatedBlackandtancoonhound](https://zippy.gfycat.com/SpottedInfatuatedBlackandtancoonhound.gif)\r\n\r\nIn this gif you can see that I selected the \"Auto Tile\" button.

Summary\r\n\r\nBuilding a Duality game (\"Publish Game\") is currently a very hardcoded process.

Each should be as self-contained as possible with the least possible shared state.\r\n- The current build process can be refactored to form the following build steps:\r\n  - Copy to target directory, filtered with a blacklist.\r\n  - Move to subdirectory, create batch file to run.\r\n  - Zip target directory.\r\n- On the editor side, the build dialog should allow free editing of the list of build steps, including adding, removing, reordering or configuring steps.\r\n  - Allow to maintain multiple distinct build configurations.\r\n- The set of available build steps can be derived from all available types in all editor plugins.\r\n- Things that additional build steps could potentially do:\r\n  - Use IL magic to merge all assemblies and plugins into one.\r\n  - Crawl all scenes to apply Prefabs and then remove their links to improve load times.\r\n  - Crawl all scenes to perform additional optimization, like static batching or similar.\r\n  - Run third-party tools for deployment on other platforms.\r\n  - Rename the launcher file and set an icon.\r\n  - Change the serialization format to binary, or something custom that discards compatibility features for speed.\r\n  - ...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/514/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4773","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507317096","x-github-request-id":"8990:366F:15FF36:2E044D:59D7D1D0","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/11561833/issues?state=all&page=3>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/11561833/issues?state=all&page=20>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/11561833/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/11561833/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"46127701811e46c577eebbdb71467e7e\"","status":"200 OK"}}
