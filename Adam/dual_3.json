Provide the option to retrieve these objects sorted by exec order, internally exploiting knowledge about pre-sorted lists to improve efficiency.\r\n  - Investigate other questionable functionality or API.\r\n- Streamline existing functionality\r\n  - To be investigated as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/510/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/509","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/509/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/509/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/509/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/509","id":213612626,"number":509,"title":"Optimize Component Lookup","user":{"login":"ilexp","id":14859411,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/14859411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp","html_url":"https://github.com/ilexp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48735419,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Core","name":"Core","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":48735357,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":76590897,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Non-Critical","name":"Non-Critical","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":48735631,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Performance","name":"Performance","color":"d4c5f9","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2/labels","id":856226,"number":2,"title":"General","description":"Improving the existing functionality of Duality without creating whole new modules or systems.","creator":{"login":"AdamsLair","id":5013908,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5013908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"open_issues":66,"closed_issues":237,"state":"open","created_at":"2014-11-06T17:02:30Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T18:50:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-03-12T15:43:33Z","updated_at":"2017-03-25T14:17:59Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"### Summary\r\n\r\nLooking up a Component by type is currently based on Dictionary lookups in both `GameObject` and `Scene`. There is potential to improve this, especially for static / generic lookups where the type is known as a JIT time parameter.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\n- Consider the following sample code:\r\n```CSharp\r\npublic T GetComponentVariantA<T>()\r\n{\r\n\t// Doing a Dictionary lookup, which is cheap but not trivial\r\n\tComponent component;\r\n\tif (this.map.TryGetValue(typeof(T), out component))\r\n\t\treturn component as T;\r\n\telse\r\n\t\treturn null;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```CSharp\r\npublic T GetComponentVariantB<T>()\r\n{\r\n\t// Statically bound lookup index. JIt-compiled into a simple read op.\r\n\tint index = ComponentType<T>.LookupIndex;\r\n\t// Every component type has a fixed element index. Basically just another cmp and read.\r\n\treturn index < this.table.Length ? this.table[index] as T : null;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- Due to the fact that most component lookups are based on concrete types using the generic lookup variant, an optimization like this could have a noticeable effect.\r\n- Dynamic or multi-type lookups can use fallback behavior using a statically stored and constructed `Dictionary` mapping a `System.Type` to a lookup index. For these cases, performance would be the same as before the change.\r\n- Memory-wise, GameObjects would be simplified and optimized since there would no longer be one `Dictionary` instance per type, but a simple array. This would be less sparse than the current data structure and, in a best case scenario, also smaller.\r\n  - Investigate what happens when the number of actively used component types is very large (100s, 1000s), how significant this case will be, and how to mitigate the effects of that.\r\n- This may or may not be a breaking change. Verify this and then decide which branch to implement this on.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/508","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/508/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/508/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/508/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/pull/508","id":212356521,"number":508,"title":"Auto-Expand sub-folder when dragging over it.

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen using an antialiased `RenderTarget` and disposing it immediately after, the rendered-to texture remains empty. The reason for this is likely that the OpenTK backend is lazy in un-binding rendertargets, which is where the blit from the internal MSAA renderbuffer to the actually connected non-MSAA texture happens.\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce\r\n\r\nPutting a RenderTarget in a using directive will trigger this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nusing (RenderTarget renderTarget = new RenderTarget(AAQuality.High, someTexture))\r\nusing (DrawDevice device = new DrawDevice())\r\n{\r\n\tdevice.Perspective = PerspectiveMode.Flat;\r\n\tdevice.VisibilityMask = VisibilityFlag.AllGroups | VisibilityFlag.ScreenOverlay;\r\n\tdevice.RenderMode = RenderMatrix.OrthoScreen;\r\n\tdevice.Target = renderTarget;\r\n\tdevice.ViewportRect = new Rect(renderTarget.Width, renderTarget.Height);\r\n\r\n\tdevice.PrepareForDrawcalls();\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tCanvas canvas = new Canvas(device);\r\n\t\t// Draw things\r\n\t}\r\n\tdevice.Render(ClearFlag.All, ColorRgba.TransparentBlack, 1.0f);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Note:_ This is not reference code on how to use RenderTargets. Do not create-destroy RenderTargets if it's not a one-off situation. For regular renderings, re-use the RenderTarget for efficiency reasons. Creating and destroying them is not \"free\".\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\nMake sure the RenderTarget is not disposed until Duality has done some other rendering, such as the regular rendering cycle.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\n- Fix approach A: Unbind RenderTargets immediately after rendering in `GraphicsBackend.EndRendering`.\r\n  - This is potentially wasteful due to added state changes in regular rendering.\r\n- Fix approach B: Unbind RenderTargets when they are disposed.\r\n  - Try this first. Seems reasonable and efficient.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/507/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/506","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/506/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/506/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/506/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/pull/506","id":211282648,"number":506,"title":"Fixes an issue with creating null-named GameObjects through code (505)","user":{"login":"ividito","id":19193384,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/19193384?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ividito","html_url":"https://github.com/ividito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ividito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ividito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ividito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ividito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ividito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ividito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ividito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ividito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ividito/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48735356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":48735419,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Core","name":"Core","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2/labels","id":856226,"number":2,"title":"General","description":"Improving the existing functionality of Duality without creating whole new modules or systems.","creator":{"login":"AdamsLair","id":5013908,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5013908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"open_issues":66,"closed_issues":237,"state":"open","created_at":"2014-11-06T17:02:30Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T18:50:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-03-02T03:56:54Z","updated_at":"2017-03-02T17:59:28Z","closed_at":"2017-03-02T17:59:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/pulls/506","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/pull/506","diff_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/pull/506.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/pull/506.patch"},"body":"First go at open-source contribution, I took a shot at fixing issue #505.

Replace this with a Scene-local instance that is created on-demand and cleared / re-used.\r\n- Rename `scene.IsCurrent` to `IsActive` to clear the way for future changes in behavior.\r\n- Find all references to `Scene.Current` and evaluate whether they can be removed or replaced with `gameObj.ParentScene`.\r\n- Make `Render` and `Update` API public and allow calling them when the Scene is not the `Current` one. \r\n  - Modify switch locking behavior to only trigger for the `Current` scene.\r\n  - Write a unit test to verify whether Component methods for rendering and updates are properly called for non-`Current` scenes when called explicitly.\r\n- Replace the static `OnLeaving` and `OnEntered` handlers with public `Activate` and `Deactivate` methods for the scene class, allowing to properly activate and deactivate a secondary / non-`Current` scene before calling update and render methods.\r\n- When done, consider going a step further and extracting `SceneManager` functionality from `Scene` that would handle scene activity and (previously) static global events.

Summary\r\n\r\nNormalizing a zero-length vector is not a valid operation, leading to a (correct) `NaN` result vector. However, since normalizing vectors is a very common operation, writing correct code tends to introduce lots and lots of length checks all over the user code base and makes relying on `.Normalized` and `.Normalize()` near impractical. Consider an alternative implementation to counter this.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\nThe options for reacting to a zero-length vector are the following:\r\n\r\n#### NaN vector\r\n\r\n- ✔️ Mathematically correct.\r\n- ❌ Useless in practice.\r\n- ❌ Viral.\r\n\r\n#### Zero vector\r\n\r\n- ❌ Mathematically incorrect.\r\n- ❌ Can cause other calculations expecting unit lengths to produce `NaN` / `Infinity`.\r\n- ✔️ Useful in practice.\r\n- ✔️ Naturally represents \"no direction\".\r\n- ✔️ Non-viral.\r\n\r\n#### 0° unit-length vector\r\n\r\n- ❌ Mathematically incorrect.\r\n- ❌ Weird bias towards a specific direction.\r\n- ✔️ Useful in practice.\r\n- ✔️ Non-viral.\r\n\r\n#### Throw an exception\r\n\r\n- ✔️ Mathematically correct.\r\n- ✔️ Makes it immediately obvious where the problem occurred...\r\n- ❌ ...but that knowledge can only be used to clutter code with more length checks.\r\n- ❌ Useless in practice.\r\n- ❌ Will crash the game for what often amounts to be insignificant large-scale.\r\n\r\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Adams_Lair/status/830780767374557186) and community chat polls seem to favor the \"Zero vector\" variant.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/502/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/501","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/501/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/501/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/501/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/pull/501","id":207301428,"number":501,"title":"Potential

Find a way to unify them.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\nThis feature is very much wip / concept phase. Feedback and contributions to the thought process appreciated.\r\n\r\n#### First Draft\r\n\r\n- All four of the above resources could be unified into a single text-based drawing technique description file.\r\n- The file format could simply consist of a flat list of sections, each with one parameter subsection and one shader subsection.\r\n- There is one subsection per shader(-program) and one general subsection that is shared by all in both parameters and code.\r\n  - Internally, every shader subsection is compiled into a distinct shader program.\r\n  - Each program section must contain at least one of vertex or a fragment shader main functions, and can contain both, if both are needed.\r\n  - The general section must not contain any main functions, but can contain shared code for all of the programs.\r\n- Parameters include the blending mode to use, depth- and alpha test settings and similar.\r\n  - Which function are main functions for vertex and fragment shaders is specified via parameter.\r\n  - Custom parameters can be added to be evaluated by the core.\r\n  - If a parameter is present in both the general section and a shader section, the value from the shader section will be used.\r\n- Allow to specify \"base techniques\".\r\n  - The general section will be merged with the current one's.\r\n  - The shader sections will be included as-is.\r\n  - Ideally, this would happen at the resource level (rename resources, etc.), but there could be a hint parameter in the source file that gets parsed by the importer to form a bridge.\r\n- Whatever the format will look like in the end, it should not throw off syntax highlighters for GLSL, so they can still be used.\r\n\r\n#### Benefits\r\n\r\n- Unified file that fully describes how a material is rendered.\r\n- Full overview in the text editor.\r\n- Less noise in the Project View.\r\n- Opportunity to easily sneak in shared base functionality.\r\n- Potential for future multi-pass rendering of objects by specifying a `RenderStep` ID (or similar) per shader section and letting the graphics backend pick the appropriate one.\r\n\r\n### Attachments\r\n\r\n- Slightly related: issue #219
