Summary\n\nThe `HelpInfo` class is used by the help system to encapsulate the currently displayed piece of Advisor information. In many places, it will be generated on-the-fly for each input event, causing a large amount of garbage, which could be avoided by making `HelpInfo` a struct.\n#### Analysis\n- This hasn't been an actual issue so far. It's more of a best-practices consideration.\n- Determine whether `HelpInfo` is small enough to be viable as a struct.\n  - It currently is, but will it be long-term?\n- Check if there is a reason why HelpInfo would ever use inheritance.\n- Check the amount of potential garbage generated by the Create methods.\n- Alternatively, introduce an easy-to-use caching mechanism that would allow `IHelpProvider` implementations to return the same instance easily, without the need to cache it locally.\n  - Could be some kind of an \"hasn't changed since last time\"

package update and immediately attempt to install the package in a fresh Duality installation. \n  - Updating is not known to cause the same error, but it can't be ruled out yet either.\n#### Workaround\n- Just wait a few minutes and try again.\n#### Analysis\n- Theory: The error happens because the two internal ways of retrieving a package provide different results. \n  - Listing all available packages via `QueryAvailablePackages` includes not-yet-indexed packages.\n  - Finding a specific package via `GetRepositoryPackages` does not.\n#### Attachments\n- Error

This is not sufficient for custom vertex types that include multiple fields without a predefined role. As a prerequisite of issues #219 and #220, a better way of mapping vertex format fields to shader vertex attributes will be required.\n#### Analysis\n- Without the fixed function pipeline, shaders need to be able to declare a role for each vertex attribute.\n  - This is non-standard, GLSL doesn't support this. Introduce this as a pre-processing step.\n  - Parse vertex attribute roles using the same enum that is used on the engine side.\n  - Use C# attribute notation? \n    - `[VertexElementRole(Position)] attribute vec3 vertexWorldPos;`\n    - Quite verbose. Doesn't fit in well.\n  - Use more GLSL-like notation? `\n    - `@position attribute vec3 vertexWorldPos;`\n    - `attribute vec3 vertexWorldPos : position;`\n    - Looks a lot better.\n- The current set of vertex element roles is very narrow. Extend this.\n  - Introduce a bigger set of roles to choose from.\n  - Don't do hardcoded numbering like `Position0`, `Position1`.\n- If no role is set, or multiple vertex attributes match the same role, perform name-based comparison to select the best match.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/347","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/347/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/347/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/347/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/347","id":163526781,"number":347,"title":"Rename

will determine how far the cursor will advance after this glyph, rather than using some internal calculations. The `MonoSpace` property will then become purely FYI.\n- Remove `KerningSamplesLeft` and `KerningSamplesRight` entirely and replace the kerning algorithm with an optionally provided set of

Summary\n\n[This game jam project](https://github.com/ilexp/bmj2016-06) managed to break in-editor picking operations completely.

Revert [this commit](https://github.com/ilexp/bmj2016-06/commit/a1869335dc7cb35619d4336e8c5fd7d81dd1d6a2#diff-f4478f73416db39395271011e21ded5a) on the file `HudRenderer.cs` specifically, without touching any other files. These changes fix the behavior.\n3. Open the editor and set it up in a way that there are two CamViews visible at the same time. One is set to `Scene Editor`, the other is set to `Game View`.\n4. Start the game in sandbox mode.\n5. Stop the game.\n6. Picking is now broken, permanently. It is still performed, but yields wrong results.\n   - Reports object ids that appear to have not been rendered at all.\n   - Constantly spams \"Unexpected Picking result\" logs.\n   - Sometimes even spawns `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`, probably due to accessing out of bounds data based on invalid \"picked\" object ids.\n#### Workaround\n- The above linked commit fixes this issue by adjusting the `HudRenderer` Component implementation. It is unknown why exactly this works.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/342/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/341","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/341/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/341/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/341/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/341","id":162301591,"number":341,"title":"Shorten Type Names in Grouped PropertyEditors","user":{"login":"ilexp","id":14859411,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/14859411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp","html_url":"https://github.com/ilexp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":322383297,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Dependency","name":"Dependency","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":48735357,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":76590897,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Non-Critical","name":"Non-Critical","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":48735612,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Usability","name":"Usability","color":"d4c5f9","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2/labels","id":856226,"number":2,"title":"General","description":"Improving the existing functionality of Duality without creating whole new modules or systems.","creator":{"login":"AdamsLair","id":5013908,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5013908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"open_issues":66,"closed_issues":237,"state":"open","created_at":"2014-11-06T17:02:30Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T18:50:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-06-25T22:01:16Z","updated_at":"2016-10-02T10:48:36Z","closed_at":"2016-10-02T10:48:36Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"#### Summary\n\nIn the current version, memberwise-, list-, and potentially other grouped PropertyEditors display the full type name in the value area of the group.

Summary\n\nWith the tilemaps plugin slowly nearing its conclusion, a merge into the master branch is imminent. As a prerequisite, all content-side development issues of the [Tilemaps Plugin v1.0](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/Tilemaps%20Plugin%20v1.0) milestone need to be successfully dealt with. Optional post-release additions to the tilemaps plugin have already been moved out of this milestone.\n#### Analysis\n- After merging into master but before release, there should be a testing session with the community to iron out all the rough edges.\n- The overall API should be considered stable.\n- Documentation should have reached a sufficient state.\n- The process of setting up a tilemaps environment from scratch should be as user-friendly as possible.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/335/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/334","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/334/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/334/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/334/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/334","id":160765726,"number":334,"title":"Moving objects with Mouse button won't work properly","user":{"login":"ExAmbitionAl","id":18245182,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/18245182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ExAmbitionAl","html_url":"https://github.com/ExAmbitionAl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ExAmbitionAl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ExAmbitionAl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ExAmbitionAl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ExAmbitionAl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ExAmbitionAl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ExAmbitionAl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ExAmbitionAl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ExAmbitionAl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ExAmbitionAl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-06-16T21:30:45Z","updated_at":"2016-06-17T10:25:54Z","closed_at":"2016-06-17T10:25:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I am making a project, the strategy Stronghold-like game in 2D of course.
