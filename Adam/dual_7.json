It should be re-organized.\r\n### Analysis\r\n- This needs to happen before [branching off v3.0](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/milestone/6), as it will make merges pretty much impossible.\r\n- It will invalidate all previous repository links from the forum, since they don't use versioned links, but head links.\r\n  - [Using commit-links](http://forum.adamslair.net/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=934) should prevent this in the future.\r\n- It will also screw up file history, since git usually stops tracking after a rename / move.\r\n  - Investigate whether it would make sense to [perform renames and move operations with git directly](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-mv).\r\n  - Potentially not though, as the git move seems to be [a shortcut](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/SRCTREEWIN-821?focusedCommentId=496696&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-496696) for a regular move with git add and git remove.\r\n- Probably still worth it, as a long-term investment.\r\n- Reduce top-level folders to a categorizing minimum.\r\n  - **Source**: Contains the actual source code for all of Duality itself, as well as standard plugins.\r\n  - **Build**: Contains build tool binaries, scripts and specs for building NuGet packages, Documentation, etc.\r\n  - **Tools**: Containts source code for build tools, VS debugger integration, etc.\r\n  - **.github**: GitHub-specific config files.\r\n  - That's it? All else should be the regular and / or required top-level files.\r\n- Every top-level folder except \"Build\" should be self-contained, so deleting all others will leave them unaffected.\r\n- The \"Source\" folder should also be restructured internally:\r\n  - Core (including primitives and tests)\r\n  - Editor (including updater and tests)\r\n  - Launcher\r\n  - Plugins, Plugins/Tilemaps, Plugins/EditorModules, ...\r\n  - Platform, Platform/Net45, ...\r\n  - Samples, ...\r\n  - Remove secondary solutions files and get back to the single \"Duality.sln\" one that contains everything. Make sure its internal folder structure matches the actual folder structure.\r\n- Update `appveyor.yml`, potentially scripts.\r\n- Update nightly build config file (relative paths).\r\n- Do a test-merge into release to see if AppVeyor can do a complete build.\r\n- Update Wiki pages with regard to source code links (Find / Replace

Summary\n\nWhen executing the finalizer of a Serializer that is based on a non-closing stream wrapper, an Exception will be thrown if the file stream has already been closed before.\n### How to reproduce\n- In the real-world use case that is described [here](http://forum.adamslair.net/viewtopic.php?p=5640#p5640), the bug occurs non-deterministically.\n- It can, however, be reproduced by explicitly creating a serializer, using it on a wrapped stream, disposing the underlying stream and then waiting for the serializer to be garbage-collected.\n### Analysis\n- Investigate a potential Serializer leak, since it isn't disposed, but collected.\n- Investigate a potential bug in the finalizer implementation of Serializer.\n- Investigate desired behavior when invoking functionality on a wrapper stream when the wrapped stream is disposed. However, it is likely that throwing an `ObjectDisposedException` is the preferable behavior and the bug occurs because of using the wrapper in a bad / an unsafe way.\n### Attachments\n- [Forum posting

Summary\r\n\r\nThe Resource class provides virtual `OnSaving` / `OnSaved` handler methods that are only invoked when serializing via Resource API, but not when using a serializer explicitly. Long-term, behavior between the two options should be synced.\r\n### Workaround\r\n- Use `Resource.Save` API for serializing Resources, rather than serializer API.\r\n### Analysis\r\n- The only Resource that makes use of these handlers is the `Scene`.\r\n- The required special behavior in `Scene` could potentially be achieved by providing an `ISerializeExplicit` implementation for its `GameObjectManager`.\r\n- To fully synchronize behavior across APIs, dynamically adding and removing field blockers would also need to be moved elsewhere.\r\n- Alternatively, let the Resource base class implement `ISerializeExplicit` (or similar?) and provide its implementation via virtual methods, while performing the previous handler logic in there. However, this would require the explicit serialization to be transparent, or at least have a way to fall back to 100% default behavior.

Summary\n\nRight now, every Camera instance has its own configuration of rendering passes. The only viable way to share them among different Cameras is using a Prefab, which may have side effects that are not intended or wanted by the user. Sharing rendering setups is the default case, so it should be easy and straight-forward.\n### Workaround\n- Create a Camera Prefab and use it to share the rendering setup.\n### Analysis\n- A new Resource type could be created to store the rendering setup information, with each Camera referencing it.\n- All Camera-related information in a rendering pass should be expressed as a relative value, so it scales according to each using camera's settings.\n- When no Resource is referenced, a default setup should be used. Also introduce the default rendering setup to the available default resources.\n- For cases where a non-shared / unique / custom rendering setup is used, it shouldn't be too bad to just create another rendering setup resource.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/388/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/387","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/387/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/387/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/387/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/387","id":174949482,"number":387,"title":"Fix Exception When Switching Tile Palette Tileset From Big to Small","user":{"login":"ilexp","id":14859411,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/14859411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp","html_url":"https://github.com/ilexp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48735356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":271580333,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Package","name":"Package","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":50803016,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Up%20For%20Grabs","name":"Up For Grabs","color":"006b75","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2/labels","id":856226,"number":2,"title":"General","description":"Improving the existing functionality of Duality without creating whole new modules or systems.","creator":{"login":"AdamsLair","id":5013908,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5013908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"open_issues":66,"closed_issues":237,"state":"open","created_at":"2014-11-06T17:02:30Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T18:50:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-09-04T13:40:55Z","updated_at":"2016-09-16T13:06:00Z","closed_at":"2016-09-16T13:06:00Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"#### Summary\n\nWhen changing the Tileset that is used in the Tile Palette to one that contains fewer tiles than the current tile selection includes, an Exception will be thrown.\n#### How to Reproduce\n1.

All code needs to check.\n  - A Tile's index could actually be fixed during resolve, since the index is a non-persistent / temporary value.\n- Side note: When switching a Tilemap's Tileset, does it already re-resolve all of its tiles? Because that should be done in any case.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/385/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/384","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/384/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/384/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/384/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/384","id":174891994,"number":384,"title":"Provide ICmpTilemapRenderer API to Convert Tile Pos to Local Space Pos","user":{"login":"ilexp","id":14859411,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/14859411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp","html_url":"https://github.com/ilexp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48735357,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":271580333,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Package","name":"Package","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":50803016,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Up%20For%20Grabs","name":"Up For Grabs","color":"006b75","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2/labels","id":856226,"number":2,"title":"General","description":"Improving the existing functionality of Duality without creating whole new modules or systems.","creator":{"login":"AdamsLair","id":5013908,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5013908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"open_issues":66,"closed_issues":237,"state":"open","created_at":"2014-11-06T17:02:30Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T18:50:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-09-03T11:14:48Z","updated_at":"2016-09-16T14:17:25Z","closed_at":"2016-09-16T14:17:25Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"#### Summary\n\nThe current `ICmpTilemapRenderer` API provides functionality to determine the tile position from a local space position, but not vice versa.

This requires a significant effort on the art side (or requires additional tooling), since all 47 base permutations of the tile need to be done manually. Introduce an option to let each AutoTile layer generate these permutations from the available tiles.\n#### Analysis\n- A regular AutoTile layout splits a tile into four sub-tiles. By recombining the existing sub-tiles, remaining base permutations can be created easily.\n- `Tileset.TileCount` needs to be revisited to account for constructed tiles. There needs to be one count with only the source tiles considered, and another with really all of them considered.\n- For each surroundings / AutoTile index, there is a mapping to a valid tile index. No exceptions. If there is none for a given setup, use a suitable fallback instead.\n- When constructing missing tiles from existing ones, derive tile info from source tiles: Height, vertical / flat should be the same, collision needs to be pieced together.\n- Auto-generated tiles should not show up anywhere the user directly interacts with or reviews a Tileset.\n#### Attachments\n\nTest Tileset for AutoTile
