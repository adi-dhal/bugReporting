While developing, we're not compressing our textures, and as a result have sometimes as much as 2GB or more of data loaded. The solution is to modify the DualityLauncher exe with the LARGEADDRESSAWARE flag so it can access an extra gig or two of memory. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1272096/resharper-throws-outofmemoryexception-on-big-solution for an example of how to set the flag. This seems to work fine, but I'm making a fairly big assumption that Duality doesn't do anything funny with pointer arithmetic.\n\nIt seems, Dualitor runs out of memory for very large projects. While it would be in theory possible to make Duality a full AnyCPU / x64 application with some more work on the dependencies, this is certainly not a solution.\n\nInstead, Dualitor should manage its memory more efficiently - unlike the game, it's likely that all Resources are loaded during its runtime at once, which will exceed any memory limit easily, if a project grows in size. There should be some mechanism to unload large Resources when the memory runs low.\n- Flag Resources with the potential to become very large with a special attribute\n- The `ContentProvider` should get some kind of Cleanup method where large Resources are unloaded.\n- There should be some mechanism to determine when a Resource was used last or how often it was used in the last few minutes, which could be the basis for deciding _which_ Resources to unload.\n- Unloading Resources that are still used won't be a problem - they'll be reloaded when needed anyway.\n- It is probably a good idea to just unload the oldest large Resource, as it will serve as some kind of usage metric. When used, it will be loaded again directly, making it the newest Resource and unattractive to the cleanup algorithm. When unused, it won't be loaded again.\n- The Cleanup method shouldn't do anything when there is enough memory available to fit in more large Resources.\n- The Cleanup method should never touch Resources the ContentProvider class can't reload itself i.e. runtime, default or manually registered / aliased Resources.\n- Always get rid of very large Resources first. Leave the small ones alone, as long as there are a lot of larger ones.\n- What mechanisms of memory management are provided by .Net? What's with WeakReference and the like? Can they be used efficiently for memory management in the editor?\n  - [WeakReference](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.weakreference.aspx)\n  - [GC.KeepAlive](http://defragdev.com/blog/?p=129)\n  - [WeakReference and IDisposable](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2841225/weak-references-and-disposable-objects)\n  - [GC.GetTotalmemory](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.gc.gettotalmemory.aspx)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/31/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/30","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/30/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/30/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/30/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/30","id":18043719,"number":30,"title":"Remove MetaFormat Serialization","user":{"login":"AdamsLair","id":5013908,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5013908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48735419,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Core","name":"Core","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":48735426,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Editor","name":"Editor","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":48735364,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Task","name":"Task","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":48735612,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Usability","name":"Usability","color":"d4c5f9","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-08-14T09:52:04Z","updated_at":"2013-08-21T10:37:40Z","closed_at":"2013-08-21T10:37:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The Serialization MetaFormat serves the following purposes:\n- Provide insight to raw but structured serialized data.\n- Allow to modify such data and serialize it afterwards.\n- Convert different serialization formats even when data is damaged i.e. cannot be deserialized correctly.\n- Maintenance tasks, such as renaming Types, Namespaces, etc.\n\nHowever, due to ongoing Duality development, all of those tasks are no longer valid and / or can be done otherwise using existing systems.\n- Insight to serialized data was far more important when there was no XML serialization.

The user can always just iterate over RigidBodies in the Scene.\n- Dualitor could probably also benefit from some of these features\n  - When adding a RigidBody to a GameObject with a SpriteRenderer etc. automatically generate a starting shape from the used primary texture.\n  - This could be done using the Convert API to keep it extensible. Just ask for a collection of ShapeInfos and add converters for SpriteRenderer-to-ShapeInfo, etc.\n- Dualitor, RigidBody Editor:\n  - Add a \"Freeform Polygon\" tool that allows any kind of polygon using any number of vertices that automatically decomposes the user input after finishing the operation.\n  - Add a \"Move Vertices\" tool that allows moving already set vertices.\n  - To allow all that, move the default cursor state to a distinct toolbar button. \n  - Probably refactor some RigidBodyEditor code so all this can be implemented in a clean way without hacking.\n  - Make sure switching modes behaves intuitively.\n  - Add keyboard shortcuts for new modes.\n\nSolution:\n- Implement this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/21/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/20","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/20/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/20/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/20/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/20","id":17022802,"number":20,"title":"Auto-Update for Dualitor","user":{"login":"AdamsLair","id":5013908,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5013908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":76591442,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Arguable","name":"Arguable","color":"fad8c7","default":false},{"id":48735426,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Editor","name":"Editor","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":48735357,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-07-21T19:30:06Z","updated_at":"2014-03-03T12:08:50Z","closed_at":"2014-03-03T12:08:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Problem:\n- Updating Duality to a new version is a frequent and repeating task:\n  -
