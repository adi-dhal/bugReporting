The object should move weirdly, and a lot of error messages should be written to the log.\n\nThis issue seems prevalent on the latest Duality binary release.

Older versions will not be removed, but should be. This can be an issue in a multi-user version control setup, where only `PackageConfig.xml` is part of version control, but not `Source\\Packages`.\n#### Analysis\n- It's probably sufficient to extend the [FirstTimeSetup](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/blob/master/DualityEditor/Program.cs#L122) method in the editor main program.\n  - Before verifying all packages, there should be an additional step where unlisted packages are uninstalled.\n  - Be very careful here: _Only_ uninstall Duality packages, since all others will not be listed in `PackageConfig` anyway.\n  - Also make sure uninstalling a package before the verification step doesn't have side effects, such as removing the uninstalled package from the verification list inadvertently.\n- This feature needs thorough testing before being released, as it affects the update mechanism itself. Don't do a rush-release on this one.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/299/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/298","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/298/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/298/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/298/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/298","id":136905389,"number":298,"title":"Add Code Analyzers to Duality Core Source","user":{"login":"ilexp","id":14859411,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/14859411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp","html_url":"https://github.com/ilexp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":271580199,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Backend","name":"Backend","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":48735419,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Core","name":"Core","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":48735426,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Editor","name":"Editor","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":76590897,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Non-Critical","name":"Non-Critical","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":48735364,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Task","name":"Task","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2/labels","id":856226,"number":2,"title":"General","description":"Improving the existing functionality of Duality without creating whole new modules or systems.","creator":{"login":"AdamsLair","id":5013908,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5013908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"open_issues":66,"closed_issues":237,"state":"open","created_at":"2014-11-06T17:02:30Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T18:50:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-02-27T10:34:22Z","updated_at":"2016-04-17T19:54:33Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"#### Summary\n\nSwitch the main development repository of Duality to Visual Studio 2015 to gain access to the new Analyzer feature and add some Analyzers to reduce reviewing workload on Pull Requests. This should not affect the minimum required version to develop plugins with Duality, only developing Duality itself will be upgraded. The framework version should not be changed.\n#### Analysis\n- Visual Studio 2015 should provide access to the [Analyzers](http://www.dotnetcurry.com/visualstudio/1197/diagnostic-analyzers-visual-studio-2015) feature\n- Code Analyzer availability is probably the main benefit of switching to VS 2015. This will allow to enforce coding style and other development guidelines and reduce the code review workload for new contributions.\n- For Duality plugins, nothing should be changed. Users can switch versions as they prefer and compatibility should be a bigger concern. VS 2015 is still comparatively new and there is no good reason to enforce this as a minspec for framework users.\n- Before doing this, make sure AppVeyor is able to compile Visual Studio 2015 projects and solutions. _Edit:_ It's [probably installed](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/installed-software#visual-studio-2015).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/298/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/297","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/297/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/297/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/297/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/pull/297","id":136858445,"number":297,"title":"Undo

Replace this concept with a new \"Object Preview\" editor module that simply displays a preview of the currently selected object(s).\n#### Analysis\n- With a custom (docking) editor module, previews can be adjusted by the user to fit any size, rather than being dependent on proprety editor sizes.\n- It would be a lot easier for custom Resources to display a preview, since all that is needed is a custom `PreviewProvider`, which is a lot easier to write and more versatile, as it is also used by `ContentRef<T>` property editors, etc.\n- A lot of custom PropertyEditor code could be removed or unified after implementing this.\n  - `TexturePreviewPropertyEditor` / `TextureContentPropertyEditor` / `TexturePropertyEditor`\n  - `PixmapPreviewPropertyEditor` / `PixmapContentPropertyEditor` / `PixmapPropertyEditor`\n  - `FontPreviewPropertyEditor` / `FontContentPropertyEditor` / `FontPropertyEditor`\n  - `AudioDataPreviewPropertyEditor` / `AudioDataPropertyEditor`\n  - `ImagePreviewPropertyEditor`\n- Releasing this package would also require releasing a new installer `.zip` package, since the list of default packages will have to be extended.\n- Should multiple instances of an Object Preview module be allowed?\n  - If yes, a selection coordination similar to the existing one in Object Inspector would be necessary.\n  - If not, there will no longer be a convenient per-selection-group preview like currently in a multi-inspector situation.\n  - Does this really add value? Questionable. Maybe limit to single-instance for now and extend later when needed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/293","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/293/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/293/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/293/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/293","id":135106756,"number":293,"title":"TreeViewAdv Exception in PackageManager","user":{"login":"ilexp","id":14859411,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/14859411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp","html_url":"https://github.com/ilexp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48735356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":322383297,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Dependency","name":"Dependency","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":50803016,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Up%20For%20Grabs","name":"Up For Grabs","color":"006b75","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2/labels","id":856226,"number":2,"title":"General","description":"Improving the existing functionality of Duality without creating whole new modules or systems.","creator":{"login":"AdamsLair","id":5013908,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5013908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"open_issues":66,"closed_issues":237,"state":"open","created_at":"2014-11-06T17:02:30Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T18:50:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":9,"created_at":"2016-02-20T18:09:43Z","updated_at":"2016-02-28T21:14:38Z","closed_at":"2016-02-28T21:14:38Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"#### Summary\n\nWhen using the Package Manager tree view with keyboard input, an unhandled exception is thrown when attempting to scroll past the end of the list.\n#### How to reproduce\n- Open the Package Manager.\n- Select \"Online Repository\" as a source.\n- Click into the package list.\n- Hold the down arrow key until reaching bottom.

Really, there is no way around this.\n- An **OpenGL widget** that can be used to render the game somewhere in the editor.\n- **High-DPI** awareness. (See issue #140)\n## Desirable Traits\n- Written primarily in **managed code / C#** - if it can be avoided, don't introduce natively compiled things into the otherwise managed Duality world.\n- Being able to **deploy the same binaries** on all of the supported systems with runtime detection what backend to use - similar to the goal of Duality's cross platform support.\n- Being able to **embed the UI framework** itself inside the game, allowing to use the same UI framework both ingame and in the editor - which would make developing editor plugins a lot more straightforward.\n- **Separate style from structure**, providing proper skinning support.\n- **Separate model from view**, hopefully making the overall UI code cleaner.\n\n---\n\nThere is nothing wrong with WinForms or the current editor, and while there sure is room for improvement, a UI framework change would be a considerable effort that should not be decided easily.
