[Implement and thoroughly test a feature in the master branch.]\n2. Create a distinct [Package Update](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/commit/a1023558baddd6664727001a73b264f02da8ca46) commit where all affected NuGet package specs are updated, as well as their dependencies and the corresponding AssemblyInfo files.\n3. Merge `master` into `release`. AppVeyor will build the binaries.\n4. Log into AppVeyor, go to `Environments / Duality NuGet Package Release`, click `Update` and select the latest merge commit into `release`.\n\nThe obvious problem is in the Package Update step, which is just a lot of manual work that could easily be automated using a command line tool. Ideas for such a command line tool:\n- It should be executed manually on the developer's machine who does the `Package Update` commit.\n- It could scan the directory structure and automatically determine the projects that are affected by the sum of all commits since the last `Package Update` commit in git history.\n- For each affected project, the appropriate git commit messages can be retrieved and condensed into each package's release notes. They can be added to the nuspec automatically.\n- The tool would then display a list of commits for each affected project and ask whether this should be considered a major, minor or patch update. The appropriate version number can be incremented.\n- The version numbers in both nuspecs and AssemblyInfo files are updated accordingly.\n\nThis would streamline the binary release process. It would also make it a lot more failsafe and easier for other developers (who might be entering the future core team of Duality) to grasp.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/271/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/270","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/270/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/270/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/270/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/270","id":128038083,"number":270,"title":"Consider Rewriting CanvasState Vertex Transformation","user":{"login":"ilexp","id":14859411,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/14859411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp","html_url":"https://github.com/ilexp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":76591442,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Arguable","name":"Arguable","color":"fad8c7","default":false},{"id":285976390,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Breaking%20Change","name":"Breaking Change","color":"fad8c7","default":false},{"id":48735419,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Core","name":"Core","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":48735357,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":76590897,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Non-Critical","name":"Non-Critical","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":402199980,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Rendering","name":"Rendering","color":"d4c5f9","default":false},{"id":278510148,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Unit%20Tests","name":"Unit Tests","color":"fef2c0","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/6","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/milestone/6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/6/labels","id":1581240,"number":6,"title":"v3.0","description":"Everything that will be part of the major v3.0 Duality release.","creator":{"login":"ilexp","id":14859411,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/14859411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp","html_url":"https://github.com/ilexp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":25,"closed_issues":30,"state":"open","created_at":"2016-02-13T16:51:45Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T17:29:53Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-01-21T22:38:43Z","updated_at":"2017-08-30T20:52:06Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"In the current implementation the `Canvas` convenience class is not able to express complex (stacked) and arbitrary vertex transformations.

When returning to the CamView (with the mouse cursor), users may often press a hotkey directly and naturally expect it to work - however, as input focus is still on the last used control and no click occurred, the CamView is unable to react. One of these cases is the usage of the \"hold space bar\" camera navigation, some others emerge with [tilemap editing](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/249).\n\nA global event hook to capture input whenever the mouse cursor is above the CamView is not a solution, because users may as well hover it inadvertently while using a textbox or similar elsewhere. Right now, the space bar is captured this way, combined with a few hacks to prevent some of the bad cases from happening. This, however, is not a good solution and it can only work reliably, because space is rarely the first character in keyboard input.\n\nIn all other cases, users will currently have to manually focus the CamView in order to be able to use CamViewState-specific hotkeys. This is usually done by clicking the middle mouse button, but it's definitely not ideal this way.\n\nInvestigate solutions to this problem.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/265","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/265/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/265/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/265/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/265","id":126159377,"number":265,"title":"Investigate Editor-Only \"Load From Remote Sources\" Exception","user":{"login":"ilexp","id":14859411,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/14859411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp","html_url":"https://github.com/ilexp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilexp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":48735356,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":48735426,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/labels/Editor","name":"Editor","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/milestones/2/labels","id":856226,"number":2,"title":"General","description":"Improving the existing functionality of Duality without creating whole new modules or systems.","creator":{"login":"AdamsLair","id":5013908,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5013908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamsLair/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"open_issues":66,"closed_issues":237,"state":"open","created_at":"2014-11-06T17:02:30Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T18:50:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-01-12T11:33:24Z","updated_at":"2016-01-12T15:29:32Z","closed_at":"2016-01-12T15:29:32Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"As described [here](), Assemblies that have been marked as web-unsafe fail to load in the editor, but not the launcher.

This was introduced to account for the fact, that one Duality length unit equals one pixel in default Camera settings, which would result in objects being far too large in Farseer. Similarly, conversions for mass and time were introduced. In order to keep it all consistent, Duality converts [not only lengths, durations and masses, but _all_ units](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/blob/2f648f4874b8b3f82aff059324ab5e3382c62500/Source/Core/Duality/Utility/Math/PhysicsConvert.cs).\r\n\r\nFor most of these conversions, the resulting values are still in a reasonable range. However, when it comes to Inertia (kg*m²), the conversion to Duality usually yields values around 1.000.000, which is far too high - especially given the fact that they're stored as floats.\r\n\r\nProblems that arise from this:\r\n- Custom physics calculations can fail due to precision issues when performed in the wrong order.\r\n- It feels counter-intuitive to deal with values that high, seems \"wrong\" to the average user.\r\n\r\nThese problems should be addressed, though unfortunately, this is a breaking change that requires a major version step:\r\n- `PhysicsConvert` exposes a set of constants, requiring all dependent plugins and libraries to be recompile on change.\r\n- Explicit `Mass` values for RigidBodies are serialized in Duality units, thus are interpreted wrong when changing the underlying conversion ratios.\r\n\r\nEven though it is, at this point, unclear how to solve this issue the best way, the system should be adjusted to make changes possible without breaking anything:\r\n- `PhysicsConvert` should be a set of static readonly values rather than constants.\r\n- Store explicit mass and inertia values in Farseer units, not Duality units.\r\n\r\nThe above should be implemented regardless of the actual solution to the problem.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/257/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/256","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/256/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/256/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/issues/256/events","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/pull/256","id":120486074,"number":256,"title":"Removed redundant code in AnimSpriteRenderer.","user":{"login":"hsnabn","id":13941389,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13941389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsnabn","html_url":"https://github.com/hsnabn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsnabn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsnabn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsnabn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsnabn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsnabn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsnabn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsnabn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsnabn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsnabn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-12-04T21:05:59Z","updated_at":"2015-12-04T23:10:09Z","closed_at":"2015-12-04T23:10:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdamsLair/duality/pulls/256","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/pull/256","diff_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/pull/256.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/pull/256.patch"},"body":"In light of this issue here:\nhttps://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/issues/253\n\nThe removed code would not be executed, and as such was deemed to be harmless to remove in the above mentioned issue.\n\nAnd, uh, sorry if the pull request seems... small.
