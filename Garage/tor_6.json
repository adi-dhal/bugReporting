determines how much buffer zone there is until it pops to the imposters.\r\nSo for example if your imposter level is 128 pixel and you have 32 imposter size then it will start to fade at 160 pixel and on 128 pixels it is fully faded out.\r\nIt works when you set it up in shape editor and then test it, but the problem is that after you saved it and load another level it no longer works, there will be no fade and they all will just pop instantly.\r\nEven if you set your imposter fade level to something, the imposter detail level will show 0 polys the next time you open your shape, it works though in the game, but it does not show, if you then set your imposter size again and save it will work again, but will be lost when you quit and load the level again.\r\n\r\nIt does not happen with the defaulttree because that setting is set in the model file using a node called:\r\n\"bb__autobillboard25\" this will set this setting in the engine directly.\r\nWhen you set it in the shape editor
