So, if it's part of the animation or parented to any bone, it should animate the camera as well. Unfortunately, that's not happening. All of my TP player models have the eye nodes, and the FP ones have the eyeMount nodes. The camera, however, stays still at the starting position of the eyeNode.\n\nMy eyeNode is parented to the Head bone. I've also tried parenting it to the root bone, but no movement at all takes place. The camera just isn't affected. Which sucks, because animators could be responsible for creating smooth and believable bob/sway for each weapon.

The original addLib macro will work just as before but these two new macros allow the use of different libs for debug/release modes.

seems that the customFootstepSound field or attribute is not working or loaded properly.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Load **Empty Terrain.mis**\n2. Open Material Editor\n3. Select _TerrainFX_sand_ or any other material\n4. Choose different Footstep sound with custom or existing sound effects profile (ie. **\"ThrowSnd\"**) then save material.\n5. Exit and Restart Torque.\n\nNo console errors and the new sound does not play. Opening the material again via editor displays **None** in that field but still writes as \n\n`customFootstepSound = \"ThrowSnd\"`\n\nwith an additional `footstepSoundId = \"-1\";`\n\n![issue](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3676827/11606934/c20d858c-9b6e-11e5-9ad3-538a250b5465.jpg)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1482/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1481","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1481/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1481/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1481/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/1481","id":120454636,"number":1481,"title":"Extacted

Not sure if was my fault or if it's an issue with the precompiled binaries, but I felt like sharing it anyway.\n\nSpecifically I'm following these two guides from the wiki:\n\nhttp://wiki.torque3d.org/introduction:your-first-project\n\nhttp://wiki.torque3d.org/coder:compiling-in-linux#toc10\n\nAnd I'm using the latest package (3.8) from here:\n\nhttp://wiki.torque3d.org/main:downloads \n\n[My system](http://i.imgur.com/cth8vn0.png)\n\nI have both sdl2 and lib32-sdl2 installed (the latter is only available in the AUR).\n\nRunning `cmake ../../../.. -DTORQUE_APP_NAME=test -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` and `make` after that, returns no errors, but if you do `make install` after that, it says that no libSDL2.so could be found in `test/buildFiles/arch/Tools/CMake/sdl2/libSDL2.so`.\n\nThis file does exist in `/usr/lib/` and the error goes away if you do `cp /usr/lib/libSDL2.0.so ./Tools/CMake/sdl2/`\n\nNow if you try to run `My Projects/test/game/game`, it will say this:\n\n`./game: error while loading shared libraries: /HDD1/torque/My Projects/game/game/libSDL2-2.0.so.1: file too short`\n\nThe error goes away and the engine starts if you copy `/usr/lib/libSDL2-2.0.so.0` in the same directory as the executable.\n\nHope this helps if anyone else is having this issue. Any input as to what caused this, would also be appreciated since I'm trying to learn.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1465/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1464","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1464/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1464/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1464/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/1464","id":116939318,"number":1464,"title":"bullet
