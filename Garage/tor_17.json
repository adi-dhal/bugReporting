new method to GuiBitmapCtrl in order to set \"named textures\" as the image displayed in script.\nThose \"named textures\" are created in two places from script (not c++) that I know: as part of GuiOffscreenCanvas (targetName field) and, more useful, as the target of a PostEffect using target = \"#name\" (the '#' symbol is not used for this method).\n\nUsing a shader in PostEffect (hlsl or glsl) you can rotate images and use masks (texture[0] and texture [1]) and this function allows to display easily that result.\n\nThe problem I find is that you need to re-call the method if the texture changes.\n\nExample (directx):\nAdd this maptest.cs (and exec() it somewhere, of course)\n\n```\nsingleton ShaderData( mapshader )\n{   \n   DXVertexShaderFile   = \"./mapV.hlsl\";\n
