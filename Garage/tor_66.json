noted in [this thread](http://www.garagegames.com/community/forums/viewthread/125744), `MissionArea::getServerObject` has some awful performance implications. This function iterates through every server-side object to find a MissionArea.\n\nThis commit adds a new static member to MissionArea, `smServerObject`, which is used in place of the old brute-force search. This member is updated in `onAdd` and `onRemove`, and returned by `getServerObject`, which is now a guaranteed constant-time function call.\n\nNOTE: The commit message is slightly wrong. The old function didn't iterate over every server-side object; it iterated over all scope-always objects, a subset of the world. Still, not good news.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/139","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/139/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/139/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/139/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/139","id":8223012,"number":139,"title":"Fix

If your text includes a very high-numbered unicode char, you get a crash caused by uninitialized font batch sheets. Here's the fix:\n\nIn Engine/source/gfx/gfxFontRenderBatcher.cpp, in FontRenderBatcher::getSheetMarker(), replace this:\n\nview plainprint?\n if(mSheets.size() <= sheetID || !mSheetssheetID) \n{ if(sheetID >= mSheets.size()) mSheets.setSize(sheetID+1); S32 size = sizeof( SheetMarker) + mLength \\* sizeof( CharMarker ); mSheets[sheetID] = (SheetMarker *)mStorage.alloc(size); mSheets[sheetID]->numChars = 0; mSheets[sheetID]->startVertex = 0; // cosmetic initialization }\n By this:\n view plainprint?\n for (U32 i=mSheets.size(); i<=sheetID; i++) \n{ if(i >= mSheets.size()) mSheets.setSize(i+1); S32 size = sizeof( SheetMarker) + mLength \\* sizeof( CharMarker ); mSheets[i] = (SheetMarker *)mStorage.alloc(size); mSheets[i]->numChars = 0; mSheets[i]->startVertex = 0; //

in-between.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/115","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/115/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/115/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/115/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/115","id":8124443,"number":115,"title":"Fix

from THREED-3144\n\nSource: http://www.garagegames.com/community/forums/viewthread/129252\n\nI was setting up some of my custom sounds and noticed the Terrain Sounds were not occurring correctly.\n I tested this further and ran in Debug mode onyl to find it is returning ONLY the first terrain material\n in the list of used materials. I verified this by testing in the clean 1.2 Fps Example without changes\n except the following:\n Basic Room / Remove Ground Plane / Add New Flat Terrain using existing Terrain materials with sounds mapped\n correctly / Set down 4 Areas (Paint em) / then do some treading.. (After Adding the Triggers to soldier.dae)\n\nHere is the sound setup:\n\nview plainprint?\n //Default Sounds \nsingleton Material( TerrainSoft ) \n{ FootstepSoundId = 0; // Soft footstep sound defined on player datablock. //ImpactSoundId = 0; // Soft impact sound. ShowDust = false; // No dust particles (footpuffs, hover trails, etc.) ShowFootprints = true; // Show footprints. }\n ; \nsingleton Material( TerrainHard ) \n{ FootstepSoundId = 1; // Hard footstep sound defined on player datablock. //ImpactSoundId = 1; // Hard impact sound. ShowDust = true; // Show dust particles. ShowFootprints = true; // Show footprints. }\n ; \nsingleton Material( Ter_desert_sand_03 : TerrainSoft) \n{ mapTo = \"desert_sand_03_base\"; diffuseMap[0] = \"art/terrains/desert_sand_03/desert_sand_03_base\"; //customFootstepSound = FootSandStepSound; materialTag0 = \"RoadAndPath\"; }\n ; \nnew TerrainMaterial() \n{ internalName = \"desert_sand_03\"; diffuseMap = \"art/terrains/desert_sand_03/desert_sand_03_base\"; detailMap = \"art/terrains/desert_sand_03/desert_sand_03_detail\"; detailSize = \"10\"; isManaged = \"1\"; detailBrightness = \"1\"; Enabled = \"1\"; diffuseSize = \"250\"; normalMap = \"art/terrains/desert_sand_03/desert_sand_03_nrm\"; detailDistance = \"350\"; }\n ; \nsingleton Material( Ter_rocktest : TerrainHard) \n{ mapTo = \"rocktest\"; diffuseMap[0] = \"art/terrains/Test/rocktest\"; //customFootstepSound = FootSandStepSound; materialTag0 = \"RoadAndPath\"; }\n ; \nnew TerrainMaterial() \n{ internalName = \"rocktest\"; diffuseMap = \"art/terrains/Test/rocktest\"; detailMap = \"art/terrains/Test/rocktest_d\"; detailSize = \"10\"; detailDistance = \"100\"; isManaged = \"1\"; detailBrightness = \"1\"; Enabled = \"1\"; diffuseSize = \"400\"; }\n ; \n.... \n(trimmed to get it all posted) \n.... \n\nThis simple test allows you to place the Single Hard Terrain sound at the top of list\n Then swap it with any of the Soft Terrains.. Requires a Restart of the Game to take effect\n and it will only use the First Material Sound..\n\nEasy way to hear the change without using the true subtle sounds\n view plainprint?\n datablock SFXProfile(FootLightSoftSound) \n{ //filename = \"art/sound/lgtstep_mono_01\"; filename = \"art/sound/orc_pain\"; description = AudioClosest3d; preload = true; }\n ; \ndatablock SFXProfile(FootLightHardSound) \n{ //filename = \"art/sound/hvystep_ mono_01\"; filename = \"art/sound/testing\"; description = AudioClose3d; preload = true; }\n ; \nIt looks like this bug occurred at 1.1 and continued into 1.2\n I will be looking at the changes between them shortly\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/114/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/113","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/113/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/113/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/113/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/113","id":8122966,"number":113,"title":"Fix
