I told Azaezel the projection matrices were wrong in OpenGL, they did not look the same as in DirectX, then he committed a fix for them:\nhttps://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/commit/223e9a8264820b2f64de28cbb131e881b03fe4be\nIt solved the issue, but later I found out, that it breaks shadows in OpenGL, then later Jeff rolled it back, it fixed the shadows, but the projection matrices are wrong again:\nhttps://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/commit/bc9033da2e51cbeb7722157d6c4da03cd29f002e\n\nIt is not that big of an issue, but it makes that the clipping distance is wrong. In my example, I have a player that uses realistic first person view, so it uses the full model in first person, but you can see pieces of the helmet if you look up, while it is not visible in DirectX rendering.\n\nFor reference it is the \"nearClip\" value in theLevelInfo object in your mission.\nBy default it is set to 0.1 for each level, which is a good distance, but if you switch to OpenGL it behaves like it would have been set to 0.05, so about half the value as in DirectX.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1666/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1665","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1665/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1665/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1665/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1665","id":162300298,"number":1665,"title":"No

A DEB package would greatly simplify the distribution of Torque3D to Linux users. In fact, if we can build a DEB package for Torque3D, I can submit the package for inclusion into the official Debian repository, thus allowing Debian/Ubuntu users to simply perform a `apt-get install torque3d` to automagically install Torque3D with all necessary dependencies.\n\nAdding DEB package support shouldn't be that difficult. I implemented a small 15-line [proof-of-concept on my local fork](https://github.com/vilhelmgray/Torque3D/commit/c8818228c1124fc3018f43db9f04f24d50f77f5d). Essentially, we create a new **CPackConfig.cmake** file where we configure the package, and add `include(CPackConfig.cmake)` at the end of **CMakeLists.txt**; that's pretty much the bare bones of it!\n\nAfter the usual `cmake && make && make install`, the user may now execute `make package` and `make package_source` to build the respective DEB binary package and DEB source package.\n\nUnfortunately, my proof-of-concept isn't ready for a pull request just yet: the finished DEB package is missing the final executable (which is strange since all the other files and directories under _games_ is packaged), and the directory layout within the DEB package isn't quite right for proper installation.\n\nBy the way, I also ran into issue #1465 during `make install`; this issue isn't related to the DEB package support code, but I'm just giving a heads up on my experience since `make install` is required before `make package`. I was able to get past the issue by simply copying the **libSDL2-2.0.so.0.4.0** file from the _games_ directory to the _buildFiles/arch/Tools/CMake/sdl2_ directory and renaming it to **libSDL2.so**.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1650/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1649","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1649/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1649/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1649/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1649","id":160012658,"number":1649,"title":"Compile Error: \"GCC: Unsupported Target CPU\"","user":{"login":"practicing01","id":3627516,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3627516?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/practicing01","html_url":"https://github.com/practicing01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/practicing01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/practicing01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/practicing01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/practicing01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/practicing01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/practicing01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/practicing01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/practicing01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/practicing01/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":174909347,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/Linux","name":"Linux","color":"f7c6c7","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-06-13T18:17:30Z","updated_at":"2016-07-09T18:54:33Z","closed_at":"2016-07-09T18:54:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Linux, amd cpu.
