   While playing the game, there is a feature that blurs the gun when in the zoomed mode.

have found and fixed some bugs using PVS-Studio tool. PVS-Studio is a static code analyzer for C, C++ and C#: https://www.viva64.com/en/pvs-studio/\r\n\r\nAnalyzer warnings:\r\n\r\n* [V591](https://www.viva64.com/en/w/V591/) Non-void function should return a value. [Engine/source/core/util/tSignal.h 165](https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/blob/development/Engine/source/core/util/tSignal.h#L165)\r\n\r\n  _Comment_: If there is needed to prevent the copying of the object, then there is no need to provide the definition of the copy constructor and the assignment operator, because the member functions and `friend` functions can still call them. \r\n\r\n  _Note_: If the code is compiled by a compiler with support for the C++11 standard, you can delete them using the keyword `delete` like this:\r\n  \r\n  <pre><code>....\r\n  public:\r\n    SignalSlot( const SignalSlot&) = delete;\r\n    SignalSlot& operator=( const SignalSlot&) = delete;\r\n  ....</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n* [V547](https://www.viva64.com/en/w/V547/) Expression 'bytesRead < 0' is always false. Unsigned type value is never < 0. [Engine/source/sfx/media/sfxVorbisStream.cpp 217](https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/blob/development/Engine/source/sfx/media/sfxVorbisStream.cpp#L217)\r\n\r\n  _Comment_: The variable `bytesRead` of type `unsigned int` stores the result of the `ov_read` function, which returns a signed value (`long`). Comparison `bytesRead < 0` does not make sense.\r\n\r\n* [V547](https://www.viva64.com/en/w/V547/) Expression 'path == \"\"' is always false. To compare strings you should use strcmp() function. [Engine/source/console/consoleFunctions.cpp 2151](https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/blob/development/Engine/source/console/consoleFunctions.cpp#L2151)\r\n\r\n  _Comment_: The comparison `path == \"\"` will not be as expected. To compare a C-string to an empty string, either use the `strcmp` function, or compare the first byte of the string with the null-terminal character.\r\n\r\n* [V610](https://www.viva64.com/en/w/V610/) Undefined behavior. Check the shift operator '<<'. The left operand '~mask' is negative. [Engine/source/core/strings/unicode.cpp 472](https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/blob/development/Engine/source/core/strings/unicode.cpp#L472)\r\n\r\n  _Comment_:  \tIn an arithmetic expression, all the variables whose values can be represented with type `int` will be promoted to this type. Therefore,  the variable `mask` will be promoted to the `int` type and the result of the `~mask` expression will be a negative number. By the C++ standard, shifting a negative number to the left leads to an undefined behavior.\r\n\r\n* [V570](https://www.viva64.com/en/w/V570/) The 'box' variable is assigned to itself. [Engine/source/forest/forestCollision.h 61](https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/blob/development/Engine/source/forest/forestCollision.h#L61)\r\n\r\n  _Comment_: When copying a `cv` object, its `cv.box` field was not copied.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I suggest having a look at the emails, sent from @pvs-studio.com.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nPhillip Khandeliants","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1994/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1993","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1993/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1993/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1993/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/1993","id":224199483,"number":1993,"title":"Drag coefficient misspelled","user":{"login":"AlexBarys","id":23389809,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/23389809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBarys","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexBarys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBarys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBarys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBarys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBarys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBarys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBarys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBarys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBarys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexBarys/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":298169811,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/Improvement","name":"Improvement","color":"006b75","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-04-25T16:35:28Z","updated_at":"2017-04-27T04:52:59Z","closed_at":"2017-04-27T04:52:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/pulls/1993","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/1993","diff_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/1993.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/1993.patch"},"body":"This addresses issue #1501 \r\nThe property variable \"dragCoefficient\" was misspelled in various datablocks in the grenadeFX.cs and rocketFX.cs files, both in the Templates directory locations and the Modules directory locations.  It was misspelled as \"dragCoeffiecient\", as noted in the issue ticket.  Some but not all of those locations were spelled correct, but the property was misspelled in numerous other locations in those two files as well.  This corrects the spelling of those properties so that users trying to reference those properties in other parts of the Torquescript will be able to reference them by the correct name.  \r\nFor instance, if one had a list of datablocks that included some where the property was spelled correctly and some where it was spelled incorrectly, and wanted to iterate through that list, changing the \"dragCoefficient\"property for each, they would get an error as some of the datablocks would not have the \"dragCoefficient\" property, as it was misspelled in them.\r\nThis also makes it more intuitive for users to reference that property in other parts of Torquescript even when referencing it for a single datablock as they now do not need to know that the property is misspelled, and how it is misspelled.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1992","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1992/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1992/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1992/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/1992","id":224197829,"number":1992,"title":"Fixed
