Along with that we'll be bringing in lots of other TS-related enhancements, adding unit tests for TS to make sure we don't break your games, and processing even more of the outstanding issue list.","creator":{"login":"crabmusket","id":904269,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/904269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket","html_url":"https://github.com/crabmusket","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":231,"state":"closed","created_at":"2014-03-28T09:25:39Z","updated_at":"2015-06-25T03:38:28Z","due_on":"2015-01-31T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2015-06-25T03:38:28Z"},"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-09-23T11:49:16Z","updated_at":"2014-11-04T03:54:10Z","closed_at":"2014-11-04T03:54:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/pulls/793","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/793","diff_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/793.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/793.patch"},"body":"Necessary for fixing an issue described in #710 supports DDS PNG and JPG\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/792","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/792/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/792/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/792/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/792","id":43472679,"number":792,"title":"Link against librt","user":{"login":"crabmusket","id":904269,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/904269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket","html_url":"https://github.com/crabmusket","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":14292474,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-09-22T12:12:40Z","updated_at":"2014-09-26T03:25:54Z","closed_at":"2014-09-26T03:25:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/pulls/792","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/792","diff_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/792.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/792.patch"},"body":"Building a dedicated server under Ubuntu with CMake seems to require this.

The codeStream is similarly expanded for 32bit systems, allowing for scripts to work transparently between 32bit and 64bit platforms. This essentially follows similar code in Torque2D.\n\nIn addition similar to Torque2D OP_CALLFUNC_RESOLVE can now automatically converted to OP_CALLFUNC to speed up function calls (excluding methods). Since this can cause problems with future function lookups when packages are activated, it is by default disabled. However it can be turned on via the COMPILER_OPTIMIZE_FUNCTION_CALLS define.\n\nAs this pull request touches on the internals of the bytecode compiler, it's entirely possible something completely unexpected will break. I have however tested this code on a production T3D game and as of yet have not noticed any problems. In any event there is a complementary GIST located at https://gist.github.com/jamesu/4966d4689689d058f38a which goes through a few basic tests related to code patching which may prove insightful. Output of this script is currently identical to stock T3D.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/775","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/775/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/775/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/775/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/775","id":42108009,"number":775,"title":"player triggers.","user":{"login":"Azaezel","id":4236451,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4236451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azaezel","html_url":"https://github.com/Azaezel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azaezel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azaezel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azaezel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azaezel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azaezel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azaezel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azaezel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azaezel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azaezel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":86205503,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/Defect","name":"Defect","color":"fbca04","default":false},{"id":86205287,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/Final%20review","name":"Final review","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestones/2/labels","id":599533,"number":2,"title":"3.6","description":"This release is the first that the new Steering Committee will be responsible for.
