It does this by changing executef calls to templates which internally manage the stack, similar to how most modern C++ script binding libraries work. The templates also automatically perform type conversion, meaning you don't even need to bother converting your parameters to TorqueScript types - this is all done for you.\n\nAlong with this, all public execution calls (such as execute\\* and evaluate_) now save and restore the stack upon returning. They are also now thread safe, meaning they can be called from other threads (as long as get_Arg functions aren't used).\n\nI've also added some basic tests for the core marshalling functionality in addition to the execution calls. This should hopefully trap any expected future regressions with this functionality.\n\nIn addition some callbacks have been corrected to use the correct types instead of strings which was causing a few problems.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1164","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1164/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1164/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1164/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/1164","id":56927511,"number":1164,"title":"Remove some dead code from OpenGL shadergen.","user":{"login":"LuisAntonRebollo","id":2388307,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2388307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo","html_url":"https://github.com/LuisAntonRebollo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":86205503,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/Defect","name":"Defect","color":"fbca04","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestones/4/labels","id":612993,"number":4,"title":"3.7","description":"This version will focus on processing two of the major outstanding pull requests, James Urquhart's [TorqueScript interpreter improvements](https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/81) and Tim Condon's [GUI additions](https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/545).
