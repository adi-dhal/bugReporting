had to disable VIDEO_WAYLAND or SDL would not compile (see [this issue](https://github.com/pisto/sdos-test/commit/3726520a1747d0db48d054ba62e4bb322355cca3)). Afterwards I had to modify the sources of the collada module and the convex decomposition module because of obvious faults in the code:\n\n```\ndiff --git a/Engine/lib/collada/src/dae/daeMetaGroup.cpp b/Engine/lib/collada/src/dae/daeMetaGroup.cpp\nindex 0beb671..f517034 100644\n--- a/Engine/lib/collada/src/dae/daeMetaGroup.cpp\n+++ b/Engine/lib/collada/src/dae/daeMetaGroup.cpp\n@@ -31,7 +31,7 @@ daeElement *daeMetaGroup::placeElement( daeElement *parent, daeElement *child, d\n        (void)offset;\n        daeString nm = child->getElementName();\n        if ( findChild( nm ) == NULL ) {\n-               return false;\n+               return NULL;\n        }\n        daeElementRef el;\n\ndiff --git a/Engine/lib/convexDecomp/NvHashMap.h b/Engine/lib/convexDecomp/NvHashMap.h\nindex 3d57da0..c8dfd78 100644\n--- a/Engine/lib/convexDecomp/NvHashMap.h\n+++ b/Engine/lib/convexDecomp/NvHashMap.h\n@@ -692,9 +692,6 @@ namespace CONVEX_DECOMPOSITION\n                                mCapacity = t.mCapacity;\n\n                                copy(mData,t.mData,t.mSize);\n-                               mSize = t.mSize;\n-\n-                               return;\n                        }\n                        else\n                        {\n@@ -1521,7 +1518,7 @@ namespace CONVEX_DECOMPOSITION\n                        NX_INLINE const Entry *find(const Key &k) const\n                        {\n                                if(!mHash.size())\n-                                       return false;\n+                                       return NULL;\n\n                                NxU32 h = hash(k);\n                                NxU32 index = mHash[h];\n```\n\nThen it worked. I don't know why someone would use this return; statement in NvHashMap. It seems pretty illogical, since the data has been copied and *this can be returned again. Also the mSize will be set after the whole if to t.mSize, no reason to do it inside this branch.\n\nApply it with the patch tool with -p1 (I didn't let git diff remove the a/, b/ prefixes).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1638/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1637","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1637/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1637/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1637/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/1637","id":159170705,"number":1637,"title":"Fix

However when you set the material as translucent, the texture is replaced by the fallback \"No Texture\" texture:\n\n```\nTestCanvasMaterial.translucent = 1;\nTestCanvasMaterial.translucentBlendOp = \"LerpAlpha\";\nTestCanvasMaterial.reload();\n```\n\nWhat should happen is the named texture should work with the diffuse map of the material regardless of the underlying rendering
