GUI improvements\n- Adds mViewport to guiTSControl in order to restrict render viewport to a sub-region of the control. This is particularly useful when using a guiTSControl as a container control, as it can restrict the render area to prevent overdraw or dedicate screen space to a panel\"\n- Adds event delegates to all controls to improve ability to write GUI code in C++\n- Adds mDataString to base control so all control can carry custom data\n- Adds code support for drag & drop\n- Adds autosizing option to popup controls to improve default spacing (otherwise, dropdown panel can float far below the dropdown control itself)\n- Adds optional frame panel rendering to tab controls\n- Adds RectI alignment and clipping functions to assist in accurate placement of controls relative to their parents or siblings\n- Adds several new GUI controls:\n  - GuiIconSpawnerButtonCtrl spawns drag & drop icons. This is similar to the palette control\n  - GuiMapCtrl supports a large, pannable image (which I have used for game maps\n  - GuiMoveableCtrl is a moveable control. It's based on GuiDragAndDrop, but does not duplicate controls (as GuiDragAndDrop does)\n  - GuiUnorderedIconCollection is intended to hold a collection of moveable controls.\n  - GuiDecoration provides image rendering without event handling\n  - GuiIconControl is icon button that also displays its text label.\n  - GuiIconListCtrl is like the GuiTextListCtrl, but for icons\n  - GuiIconPopupCtrl is like GuiPopupCtrl, but for icons.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/545/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/544","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/544/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/544/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/544/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/544","id":23672291,"number":544,"title":"Update bundled PHP to 5.5.6","user":{"login":"asmaloney","id":391371,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/391371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmaloney","html_url":"https://github.com/asmaloney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmaloney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmaloney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmaloney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmaloney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmaloney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmaloney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmaloney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmaloney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmaloney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":86205503,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/Defect","name":"Defect","color":"fbca04","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestones/2/labels","id":599533,"number":2,"title":"3.6","description":"This release is the first that the new Steering Committee will be responsible for.
