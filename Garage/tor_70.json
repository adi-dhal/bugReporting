This is pretty common practice, but I can certainly understand the objection.  We do have the option of using something like Py2Exe, but that would be creating a special binary for windows.\n- It would be a full rewrite.

Anyone who has used TorqueScript heavily in an iTorque project has probably realized this. Mobile devices are of course slow, but it seems to me even doing simple things in TorqueScript is costly.\n\nAfter actually benchmarking a rather simple function call ( https://gist.github.com/3737516 ), I was shocked after seeing just how bad it can get.\n\nI'm not quite sure what the best way of tackling this is, so I'll provide as much information as I can in this Issue.\n\nMy tests seem to indicate that function calls in TorqueScript appear to be quite expensive, whereas in other embeddable scripting languages this is far from the case. Variable lookups also appear to be costly though this is true of any scripting language.\n\nFor reference, I tested 6 methods of adding two numbers together:\n- scriptTest1 returns p1 + p2\n- scriptTest2 sets global variable $_R to $_0 + $_1\n- scriptTest3 is the same as scriptTest2 except it copies the global to local variables (similar performance to test 1)\n- scriptTest4 is the same as scriptTest1, except the addition is done in C (ends up being faster)\n- scriptTest5 is the same as scriptTest2, except the addition is done in C (and is actually slower)\n- scriptTest6 adds two literals with no function calls, and is the fastest\n\nI've placed the specific code I used for benchmarking TorqueScript, Ruby and Lua in a gist: https://gist.github.com/3760645 . All results are in milliseconds, the last number being the average time taken.\n\nTorquescript results (Macbook Pro 2010 2.4ghz):\n\n```\nTorque3D RELEASE\nscriptTest1,2220,2196,2224,2248,2632,2304\nscriptTest2,692,688,696,692,692,692\nscriptTest3,2224,2208,2236,2220,2208,2219.2\nscriptTest4,448,436,436,432,432,436.8\nscriptTest5,964,956,960,960,976,963.2\nscriptTest6,280,288,284,280,288,284\n```\n\nThe worst case here is 2.3s in the pure script function call. It seems making a local variable is costly as test 3 is the second worst case. Test 5 is oddly slower than test 2, and would be even slower if I used the actual Con:: getIntVariable function which does an int->string->int conversion.\n\nThe best case is 0.29s, which beats mruby but not lua.\n\nmruby results for tests 1,2,3,6 (latest version, Macbook Pro 2010 2.4ghz):\n\n```\nTEST,1,2,3,4,5,AVG\nscriptTest1,642.965,616.527,607.443,604.453,607.673,615.8122\nscriptTest2,717.744,717.211,716.863,726.13,714.424,718.4744\nscriptTest3,729.728,726.318,722.327,728.388,722.21,725.7942\nscriptTest6,490.863,481.995,495.214,484.136,481.721,486.7858\n```\n\nNote that the worst case here is 0.73s.\n\nLua results for tests 1,2,3,6 (v5.2.1, Macbook Pro 2010 2.4ghz):\n\n```\nTEST,1,2,3,4,5,AVG\nscriptTest1,177.313000,173.866000,173.777000,173.635000,172.777000,174.273600\nscriptTest2,365.673000,366.093000,366.950000,367.679000,373.810000,368.041000\nscriptTest3,495.440000,493.399000,490.451000,492.778000,491.064000,492.626400\nscriptTest6,151.421000,150.907000,150.767000,149.743000,151.732000,150.914000\n```\n\nNote that the worst case here is 0.49s.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/10/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/9","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/9/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/9/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/9/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/9","id":7035718,"number":9,"title":"Fixed Item networking in editor","user":{"login":"crabmusket","id":904269,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/904269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket","html_url":"https://github.com/crabmusket","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2012-09-21T08:35:53Z","updated_at":"2012-09-23T21:29:53Z","closed_at":"2012-09-23T21:29:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/pulls/9","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/9","diff_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/9.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/9.patch"},"body":"When checking/unchecking 'rotate' for an Item in the editor, the Item would not update on the client.
