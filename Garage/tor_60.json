Allocation Failed - usually this took about 4 minutes or so\n\nLooking at the call stack when this occured it appeared that the VectorResize was being called by the ForestCell:buildBatches() method so it was clickly apparent this was being caused by the forest - i use the conifer forest pack by the way\n\nXifos in the IRC channel asked me to add some breakpoints to see if VectorResize was doing an allocate or a reallocate - we tested this and it was using Realloc_r. He then asked me to step through each breakpoint as I moved around my map looking at new areas of the forest and watch my memory usage - it seemed to rise 200mb from 1.6gb to 1.83gb and then at that point it would crash\n\nHe suggested this might be a memory leak but resolving it was beyond him so he suggested I post here - so here you go!\n\nFor now I have scrapped my map and creating a much smaller one that is using around 1.2gb ram on idle and so far I have had 0 crashes over the last 3 hours\n\nSteps to Repeat:\n1. Load up Torque 2.0 MIT\n2. Load a map that uses around 1.6gb ram with a large forest and all your assets\n3. Fly around the map and watch the memory usage increase until the client crashes\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/308/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/307","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/307/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/307/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/307/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/307","id":12817848,"number":307,"title":"Fix for issue #282","user":{"login":"thecelloman","id":2302649,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2302649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thecelloman","html_url":"https://github.com/thecelloman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thecelloman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thecelloman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thecelloman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thecelloman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thecelloman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thecelloman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thecelloman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thecelloman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thecelloman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2013-04-04T20:10:44Z","updated_at":"2013-04-04T20:10:57Z","closed_at":"2013-04-04T20:10:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/pulls/307","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/307","diff_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/307.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/307.patch"},"body":"Material selector now renders preview thumbnails.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/307/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/306","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/306/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/306/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/306/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/306","id":12816653,"number":306,"title":"Removing the Armor script class.","user":{"login":"thecelloman","id":2302649,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2302649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thecelloman","html_url":"https://github.com/thecelloman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thecelloman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thecelloman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thecelloman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thecelloman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thecelloman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thecelloman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thecelloman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thecelloman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thecelloman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2013-04-04T19:41:14Z","updated_at":"2014-07-10T13:27:41Z","closed_at":"2013-04-04T19:41:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/pulls/306","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/306","diff_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/306.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/306.patch"},"body":"Using PlayerData as the generic namespace.
