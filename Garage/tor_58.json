client will often crash when saving a large map with a large forest over 4mb - during the save process the forest file will be wiped to 0kb and the client will assert \n\nthis can be deceptive when working on a forest in multiple sittings as each time the torque client is reloaded from scratch the forest will use much less ram than the full amount of memory required for the whole forest if created in one sitting\n\nit would be nice if the client could maintain the amount of memory the forest is using when you first load the game and unloaded areas of the forest as you flew around instead of the memory usage increasing and never freeing as you view the entire forest\n\nhaving more ram free (as in the torque 32bit 1.75gb ram limit) seems to help save forest files even if the forest is over 4mb in file

Then the input map is changed to vehicleMap which has no binding for left stick Y, so the value is not cleared when you let go.\n\nThere are two fixes for this, one that would stop the forward movement, and additional to make it function with a gamepad out of the box.\n\nIn scripts/client/client.cs\n\nin the function clientCmdtoggleVehicleMap(%toggle), add the following between moveMap.pop() and vehicleMap.push()\n\n```\n  // clear movement    \n  $mvForwardAction = 0;\n  $mvBackwardAction = 0;\n```\n\nThe above change fixes the core issue, but you still cannot operate the cheetah with the gamepad at this point.  The change below gets the gamepad working to control the cheetah.\n\nIn the scripts/client/default.bind.cs\n\nAt the end of the file after the other vehicleMap binds add the following:\n\n```\n  // bind the left thumbstick for steering\n  vehicleMap.bind( gamepad, thumblx, \"D\", \"-0.23 0.23\", gamepadYaw );\n  // bind the gas, break, and reverse buttons\n  vehicleMap.bind( gamepad, btn_a, moveforward );\n  vehicleMap.bind( gamepad, btn_b, brake );\n  vehicleMap.bind( gamepad, btn_x, movebackward );\n  // bind exiting the vehicle to a button\n  vehicleMap.bindCmd(gamepad, btn_y,\"getout();\",\"\");\n```\n\nThat fixes the issue and feels like a good starting point for gamepad vehicle control.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/366","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/366/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/366/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/366/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/366","id":13866378,"number":366,"title":"style.css changes for Project Manager modules","user":{"login":"DavidWyand-GG","id":2207167,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2207167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG","html_url":"https://github.com/DavidWyand-GG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2013-05-01T21:10:04Z","updated_at":"2014-06-17T18:08:14Z","closed_at":"2013-05-01T21:10:12Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/pulls/366","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/366","diff_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/366.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/366.patch"},"body":"The style.css defines how some of the Project Manager GUI elements look.\nWith the buttons for changing a project's modules some changes to this\nfile are required.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/366/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/365","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/365/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/365/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/365/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/365","id":13858412,"number":365,"title":"Particle Editor -
