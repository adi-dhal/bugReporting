This will revert that revert, while also making the terrain render in a single pass (at least for up to ~20 textures layers per terrain cell, which should be reasonable).\r\n\r\nIn order to allow rendering the terrain in a single pass, I had to move some calculations from vertex to pixel shader, so a benchmark on how this affects performance should definetly be considered.\r\n\r\nIn theory, it should be possible to solve this issue with the multi-pass rendering technique utilized currently, but I haven't been able to make it work.\r\n\r\nEdit: Furthermore, due to an issue where you can't get the constNum of a texture, the code is a bit ugly and difficult to maintain, as it assumes a specific ordering in the shader's texture constants. Should only be an issue when someone messes with that part of the terrain shader though.\r\n\r\nEdit2: Clarified it is 20 texture layers and not 20
