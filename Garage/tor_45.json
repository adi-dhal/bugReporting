(largely due to gbuffer alteration needs)\nGamma Correction now falls within the range of monitor gammas, and uses linear correction to better match texture-sheet to in-game colorization.\n\nAdditions:\nReplaced non-functional environment map slot with Translucency Mapping.\nIncorporated dynamic cubemap support for tsstatics.\nIncorporated https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/710 for obvious reasons.\nAdded explicit brightness and contrast controls.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/766/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/765","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/765/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/765/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/765/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/765","id":41467872,"number":765,"title":"RigidShape is in the Platform doc group","user":{"login":"crabmusket","id":904269,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/904269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket","html_url":"https://github.com/crabmusket","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":94970254,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/Docs%20/%20examples","name":"Docs / examples","color":"207de5","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestones/7","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestone/7","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestones/7/labels","id":821854,"number":7,"title":"3.6.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"crabmusket","id":904269,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/904269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket","html_url":"https://github.com/crabmusket","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":28,"state":"closed","created_at":"2014-10-11T02:23:03Z","updated_at":"2014-11-05T09:49:17Z","due_on":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2014-11-05T09:49:17Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-08-29T03:30:40Z","updated_at":"2014-10-23T22:19:21Z","closed_at":"2014-10-23T22:19:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"[O.o](https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/blob/development/Engine/source/T3D/rigidShape.cpp#L95) ahoy.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/764","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/764/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/764/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/764/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/764","id":41347400,"number":764,"title":"ScatterSky Flare Rendering -

This problem appears to be specific to the ScatterSky and does not seem to occur in Sun objects or lights. I'm unsure if this issue is specific to certain graphics cards similar to an earlier problem involving reflections: https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/747\n\n My original post about the issue can be found here: http://www.garagegames.com/community/forums/viewthread/138892 To sum-up the info from the post:\n\nIn scatterSky.cpp in the prepRenderImage function the flare data is setup with a position.\n\n```\nPoint3F lightPos = state->getCameraPosition() - state->getFarPlane() * mLight->getDirection() * 0.9f;  \nmFlareState.lightMat.identity();  \nmFlareState.lightMat.setPosition( lightPos );\n```\n\nJust like in the Sun object's flare code the flare is then sent to LightFlareData::prepRender. Except, unlike the Sun object's flare the ScatterSky flare exits the function here:\n\n```\nbool lightVisible = _testVisibility( state, flareState, &visDelta, &occlusionFade, &lightPosSS );  \n\n// We can only skip rendering if the light is not   \n// visible, and it has elapsed the fade out time.  \nif (  mIsZero( occlusionFade ) ||  \n      !lightVisible && visDelta > FadeOutTime )  \n   return; \n```\n\n _testVisibility will return false and the render will be skipped. By removing 'occlusionRadius' from the LightFlareData datablocks the issue seems fixed. Notably, LightFlareExample2 and SunPacificIsland do not have those values defined in script and therefore work fine without any changes.\n\n My guess is that somehow the sky itself is blocking visibility of the flare position.\n\nHere are links to the code I referenced:\n\nhttps://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/blob/development/Engine/source/environment/scatterSky.cpp#L657\nhttps://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/blob/development/Engine/source/T3D/lightFlareData.cpp#L447-L453\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/764/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/763","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/763/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/763/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/763/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/763","id":41242315,"number":763,"title":"-

PR adds an implementation of Tim Newell's ribbon code, with a \"ParticleEmitterNode-like\" RibbonNode.\n\nSince receiveing the code from Tim, the following changes has been made:\n- Option for fixed texCoords has been added to prevent \"floating\" textures.\n- Tilescale has been added to scale texCoords.\n- Now uses RIBBON_NUM_FIELDS instead of constant values for key value arrays.\n- Option for skipping an amount of emitted segments such that you can optimize the ribbons when necessary by emitting e.g. 50% of the original amount of segments, at the cost of less \"smoothness\".\n- Now only update buffers when new segments are added (Optimization).\n- Option for preventing texture stretching, such that textures always look uniformly sized.\n- A number of fixes, like being able to have more than 2 key-values.\n\n[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb-bZh8gvHQ) shows off most of the new \"front-end\" features.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/744/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/743","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/743/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/743/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/743/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/743","id":39031249,"number":743,"title":"TCPObject
