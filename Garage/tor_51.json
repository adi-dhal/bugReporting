problems I have noted, as follows:\n\n1) The SFXFMODEvent class makes use of `` `FMOD_Event_Release`. However the FMOD API docs clearly state the following regarding this function:\n\n```\nNote: This function is currently only for when you've specified >0 value for FMOD_EVENT_LOADINFO.sizeof_instancepool_simple.\n```\n\nSince Torque3D does not provide a FMOD_EVENT_LOADINFO struct when loading FMOD, I can only assume all calls to FMOD_Event_Release will effectively be redundant, leading to a memory leak. Instead `FMOD_EventGroup_FreeEventData` should be used.\n\n2) SFXFMODEventSource::_updateStatus() does not always stop the source when an error has occured, leaving the source in a perpetual invalid state. This usually happens if fmod deletes the event instance. Since `FMOD_EVENT_STATE state;` is not initialized, the playing bit may or may not be set depending on what magic values have been left on the stack.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/576/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/575","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/575/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/575/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/575/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/575","id":28709281,"number":575,"title":"Memory corruption in FMod plugin","user":{"login":"jamesu","id":10850,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesu","html_url":"https://github.com/jamesu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":14292474,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestones/10","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestone/10","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestones/10/labels","id":1221424,"number":10,"title":"3.9","description":"","creator":{"login":"Areloch","id":2553124,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2553124?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Areloch","html_url":"https://github.com/Areloch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Areloch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Areloch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Areloch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Areloch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Areloch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Areloch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Areloch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Areloch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Areloch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":10,"closed_issues":112,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-07-23T03:05:57Z","updated_at":"2017-01-20T06:49:14Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-03-04T14:35:18Z","updated_at":"2015-10-05T18:17:58Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In the designer-based FMod project, there is a rather bad problem with the way it handles not being able to load an FMod event. The problem arises in this code:\n\n```\nSFXFMODEventSource* SFXFMODEventSource::create( SFXFMODEvent* event )\n{\n   AssertFatal( event != NULL, \"SFXFMODEventSource::create - got a NULL event!\" );\n\n   // Create the source.\n\n   SFXFMODEventSource* source = new SFXFMODEventSource( event );\n   if( source->mHandle )\n      source->registerObject();\n   else\n   {\n      delete source;\n      source = NULL;\n   }\n\n   return source;\n}\n```\n\nIf `source->mHandle` is not set, it will delete the source. However this will not clear up any deletion notifications for that object as it has not been registered. This would normally not be a problem, however in `SFXSource::SFXSource( SFXTrack* track, SFXDescription* description )` we have this intriguing piece of code:\n\n```\n// Make sure we get notified when our datablocks go away\n// so we can kill this source.\nif( mTrack != NULL )\n   deleteNotify( mTrack );\ndeleteNotify( mDescription ); \n```\n\nWhich adds notifications to the source object BEFORE is has been registered. This typically causes a crash as when the associated track object is being deleted it will send a notification callback to the now deleted SFXFMODEventSource.\n\nIdeally what should happen is either of the following:\n- SFXFMODEventSource::create should call clearAllNotifications before deleting source\n- SFXSource::onAdd should call deleteNotify, not SFXSource::SFXSource\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/575/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/574","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/574/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/574/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/574/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/574","id":28662683,"number":574,"title":"Update version reporting to 3.5.1","user":{"login":"DavidWyand-GG","id":2207167,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2207167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG","html_url":"https://github.com/DavidWyand-GG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-03-03T22:23:45Z","updated_at":"2014-06-19T23:38:06Z","closed_at":"2014-03-03T22:24:07Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/pulls/574","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/574","diff_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/574.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/574.patch"},"body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/574/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/573","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/573/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/573/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/573/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/573","id":27574970,"number":573,"title":"Revert trigger polyhedron change","user":{"login":"DavidWyand-GG","id":2207167,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2207167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG","html_url":"https://github.com/DavidWyand-GG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-02-14T05:30:52Z","updated_at":"2014-07-16T06:15:18Z","closed_at":"2014-02-14T05:31:26Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/pulls/573","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/573","diff_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/573.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/573.patch"},"body":"Reverts the change made in https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/511.
