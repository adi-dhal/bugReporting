function to edit the position of decals created with decalManagerAddDecal.\n\n---\n\nPlaying with the idea of creating a shadow from script using decals I found:\n-Creating and deleting decals with TorqueScript is quite simple with the functions decalManagerAddDecal and decalManagerRemoveDecal.\n-But once you create a decal there isn't any scripted way to modify it.\n\nA solution I was thinking on use is to just keep deleting old decals and create a new one in the new position but a problem appeared as the ID of the decal keeps increasing making the c++ internal array of decals bigger.\nI fear that may end as a memory leak so I decided to add an edit function.\n\nThis function imitates how proyectedshadow works so it's quite standard.\nThe math at the start is copied from the one used when you create a decal (DecalDataFile::addDecal) to change from the user friendly F32 rotAroundNormal to the internal Point3F tangent.\nThe variables of a decal are defined as public so the change is quite direct.\n\nI decided for position, normal, rotation and size to be at the same function so it's kind of a long list of variables but it's quite similar to decalManagerAddDecal so it shouldn't be very confusing.\n\n-How to test-\nPlay the desert mission of a full template and while the player is standing in the sand (this way raycast isn't needed) type in the console:\n$decaltest=decalManagerAddDecal(LocalClientConnection.player.position,\"0.0 0.0 1.0\",\"0.0\",\"1.0\",\"ScorchRXDecal\",true);\n\nNow move the player away from the mark and type to test:\ndecalManagerEditDecal( $decaltest , LocalClientConnection.player.position , \"0.0 0.0 1.0\" , \"0.0\" , \"1.0\");\n\nThe ScorchRXDecal will move without increasing the decal ID. It returns true as there is a decal with that ID.\n\nYou can still use to remove the decal:\ndecalManagerRemoveDecal($decaltest);\n\nAnd the decal will just be removed. Trying to edit the removed decal will do nothing and return false.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1528/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1527","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1527/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1527/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1527/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/1527","id":135199835,"number":1527,"title":"Fix

want to give Torque developers a heads up.\n\nWe've been thinking about open sourcing [Torsion](https://www.garagegames.com/products/torsion) for years, but it was still pulling in a few hundred dollars a month... paying a few bills which helps a small indie like ourselves.\n\nAs of yesterday GarageGames is no longer selling Torsion, so rather than sell it ourselves the time has come to open source the thing.  I wanted to let people using T3D/T2D know about this and see if anyone was interested in helping manage the PRs that hopefully will bring it up to speed with the latest Torque releases.\n\nI plan to get the repo up this weekend here:\n\n https://github.com/SickheadGames/Torsion\n\nAlso we did this with the [AdventureKit for T2D](https://github.com/SickheadGames/AdventureKit) a few years ago, but no one noticed.  Hoping this is more useful to people using Torque still.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1523","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1523/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1523/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1523/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/1523","id":134722809,"number":1523,"title":"Cleaned
