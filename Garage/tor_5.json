have found a very nasty bug in TNL (Torque Network Library) code, which was since the very beginning (TGE1.3+ or earlier), so I will call this a \"15++ y.o. bug\" in Torque.\r\n\r\n## Issue:\r\n**`GuaranteedOrdered`** events are stopped from being processed which is caused by packed loss.\r\n\r\n### How to replicate:\r\nStart two instances of Torque engine (any engine version, T2, TGE1.3+ or latest T3D).\r\nConnect one to another via GameConnection.\r\nCall `%conn.setSimulatedNetParams(0.8, 0);` on both sides, so we simulate a 80% of packet loss.\r\nOur test functions:\r\n```\r\nfunction clientCmdTest()\r\n{\r\n   echo(\"clientCmdTest\");\r\n   commandToServer('test');\r\n}\r\nfunction serverCmdTest(%c)\r\n{\r\n   echo(\"serverCmdTest\" SPC %c);\r\n   commandToClient(%c, 'test');\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNow, on any side send `'test'` cmd to another side so its start looping (doing infinite ping-pong).\r\n\r\nIt could take some time until it stops working (it took 17 minutes for me in a first run to catch the bug, second run - 35 minutes).\r\nIn production we hit it quite often, with 500+ `NetConnection`s online the bug makes itself felt every few hours.\r\n\r\n### What happens:\r\nAs example we take \"10\" as current event sequence count.\r\nServer sends 'test' event[1] to the client:\r\n```cpp\r\nif(!bstream->writeFlag(ev->mSeqCount == prevSeq + 1)) // the prev seq was 9, so not packing 7 bits as 10 == 9+1\r\n\tbstream->writeInt(ev->mSeqCount & 0x7F, 7); // not using this\r\n```\r\n... but the packet gets lost!\r\nServer re-sends the same event[2] to the client by writing to `BitStream` the `mSeqCount`:\r\n```cpp\r\nif(!bstream->writeFlag(ev->mSeqCount == prevSeq + 1)) // 10 != 10+1\r\n\tbstream->writeInt(ev->mSeqCount & 0x7F, 7); // writing 10 here\r\n```\r\nas the event is not the next one (we are re-sending).\r\n\r\nClient receives event[2] and unpacking the `seq` via:\r\n```cpp\r\n\tif(bstream->readFlag())\r\n\t\tseq = (prevSeq + 1) & 0x7f; // not using this\r\n\telse\r\n\t\tseq = bstream->readInt(7); // <-- here we are reading 10\r\n```\r\nGoing down in the code we call `evt->unpack()` and do some checks:\r\n```cpp\r\n\tif(seq < mNextRecvEventSeq) // comparing 10 with 10, all is fine, nothing to do\r\n\t\tseq += 128; // skipped\r\n```\r\nand process it inside the \r\n```cpp\r\nwhile (mWaitSeqEvents && mWaitSeqEvents->mSeqCount == mNextRecvEventSeq) // 10 == 10\r\n{\r\n\tmNextRecvEventSeq++; // Will increment to 11\r\n```\r\nloop.\r\n\r\nThe client sends ACK for that packet we have just processed, and all is fine until that packet with **ACK is dropped** by some reason (by simulating packet drop or some real network issues).\r\nThe server will resend the same event AGAIN:\r\nServer re-sends the same event[3] to the client by writing to `BitStream` the `mSeqCount`:\r\n```cpp\r\nif(!bstream->writeFlag(ev->mSeqCount == prevSeq + 1)) // 10 != 10+1\r\n\tbstream->writeInt(ev->mSeqCount & 0x7F, 7); // writing 10\r\n```\r\nas the event is not the next one (we are re-sending).\r\n\r\nClient receives event[3] and unpacking the `seq` via:\r\n```cpp\r\n\tif(bstream->readFlag())\r\n\t\tseq = (prevSeq + 1) & 0x7f; // not using this\r\n\telse\r\n\t\tseq = bstream->readInt(7); // <-- here we are reading 10\r\n```\r\nNow is the \"magic\" part of code:\r\n```cpp\r\n\tif(seq < mNextRecvEventSeq) // comparing 10 with 11, received seq is less\r\n\t\tseq += 128; // seq becomes 138!!!\r\n```\r\nNow our `while` loop:\r\n```cpp\r\nwhile (mWaitSeqEvents && mWaitSeqEvents->mSeqCount == mNextRecvEventSeq) // 138 != 10\r\n{\r\n\tmNextRecvEventSeq++; // will never get in here\r\n```\r\nWe have ~~fucked up~~ stuck. Any further event we will receive from the server will be unpacked but never processed.\r\nThe events from the client to the server are sent and processed fine (in case it will not lockout the same way).\r\n\r\n## Solution:\r\n\r\nThe simplest solution is to use `writeCussedU32()`:\r\nreplace code\r\n```cpp\r\nif(!bstream->writeFlag(ev->mSeqCount == prevSeq + 1))\r\n\tbstream->writeInt(ev->mSeqCount & 0x7F, 7);\r\n```\r\nwith:\r\n```cpp\r\nbstream->writeCussedU32(static_cast<U32>(ev->mSeqCount));\r\n```\r\n\r\nreplace code\r\n```cpp\r\nif(bstream->readFlag())\r\n\tseq = (prevSeq + 1) & 0x7f;\r\nelse\r\n\tseq = bstream->readInt(7);\r\n```\r\nwith\r\n```cpp\r\nseq = static_cast<S32>(bstream->readCussedU32());\r\n```\r\n\r\nremove the following:\r\n```cpp\r\n   seq |= (mNextRecvEventSeq & ~0x7F);\r\n   if(seq < mNextRecvEventSeq)\r\n      seq += 128;\r\n```\r\nas we don't need it anymore.\r\n\r\nreplace the whole `while` loop:\r\n```cpp\r\n   while(mWaitSeqEvents && mWaitSeqEvents->mSeqCount == mNextRecvEventSeq)\r\n   {\r\n      mNextRecvEventSeq++;\r\n      NetEventNote *temp = mWaitSeqEvents;\r\n      mWaitSeqEvents = temp->mNextEvent;\r\n\r\n      //Con::printf(\"EVT  %d: PROCESS - %d\", getId(), temp->mSeqCount);\r\n      temp->mEvent->process(this);\r\n      temp->mEvent->decRef();\r\n      mEventNoteChunker.free(temp);\r\n      if(mErrorBuffer.isNotEmpty())\r\n         return;\r\n   }\r\n```\r\nwith:\r\n```cpp\r\n   while(mWaitSeqEvents && mWaitSeqEvents->mSeqCount <= mNextRecvEventSeq)\r\n   {\r\n      NetEventNote *temp = mWaitSeqEvents;\r\n      mWaitSeqEvents = temp->mNextEvent;\r\n\r\n      //Con::printf(\"EVT  %d: PROCESS - %d\", getId(), temp->mSeqCount);\r\n      if(temp->mSeqCount == mNextRecvEventSeq)\r\n      {\r\n         // We process only expected, any \"already-processed\" events will be skipped.\r\n         temp->mEvent->process(this);\r\n         // Advance counter to the next one\r\n         mNextRecvEventSeq++;\r\n      }\r\n      temp->mEvent->decRef();\r\n      mEventNoteChunker.free(temp);\r\n      if(mErrorBuffer.isNotEmpty())\r\n         return;\r\n   }\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Side note:\r\n\r\nEven with this change we can't prevent events with `mGuaranteeType == NetEvent::Guaranteed` from being processed more than once.\r\nThose are sent together with `NetEvent::GuaranteedOrdered` in the same packet, so it will call:\r\n```cpp\r\n      if(unguaranteedPhase)\r\n      {\r\n         evt->process(this);\r\n         evt = NULL;\r\n         if(mErrorBuffer.isNotEmpty())\r\n            return;\r\n         continue;\r\n      }\r\n```\r\nWhen our **ACK packet** (we have sent to server) is dropped or lost, the server will resend it to client and the same `Guaranteed` event will be processed again! This could lead to some undefined behaviour in game-play, depending on how this type of events are used in engine by game developers.\r\n\r\nFor us we have decided to remove the **`NetEvent::Guaranteed`** from our engine and always use `NetEvent::GuaranteedOrdered`.\r\nFrom what I see, there are no use of this atm in T3D MIT, so it can be safely (?) removed.\r\n\r\n`NetEvent::Unguaranteed` are working the same way as it was before - they are never being send more than once.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Thinking aloud\r\n\r\n1. The downside of this is: can't use `Guaranteed` type of events.\r\n2. More traffic for a long game-play sessions (when NetEvent counter hits a large amount, so the `writeCussedU32()` gives disadvantage to store large numbers).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## The End.\r\n\r\nBefore I submit PR, can someone comment on this?\r\n\r\nI think this should be applied on any/all Torque engine(s) (T2D, OpenTNL, etc), so after we finalize what we do with T3D we can spread this info to other projects.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1962/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1961","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1961/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1961/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1961/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/1961","id":212025783,"number":1961,"title":"[augs]Snapwork","user":{"login":"Azaezel","id":4236451,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4236451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azaezel","html_url":"https://github.com/Azaezel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azaezel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azaezel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azaezel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azaezel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azaezel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azaezel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azaezel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azaezel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azaezel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":298169811,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/Improvement","name":"Improvement","color":"006b75","default":false},{"id":14293078,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/New%20feature","name":"New

[this conversation](http://forums.torque3d.org/viewtopic.php?f=15&p=7642#p7642), I would like to discuss ways in which the asset system can be made more flexible. The project I'm working on references an external model library with >10K individual components, which contain their own metadata, and in some cases embed each-other as sub-components. \r\n\r\nI would love to be able to use the existing asset system to scan, query, and manage this model library, but it currently expects that all assets are serialized and deserialized as TAML. Being able to mark certain directories to be scanned using a custom serialization/deserialization interface would be incredibly helpful.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, from reading the documentation + code, it appears as though *everything* ends up going into the global StringTable, and I'm fairly concerned about the performance impact of that many entries, the majority of which will never actually be loaded for a given game instance (but which the AssetManager is still responsible for tracking).\r\n\r\nGiven that some work is already planned for the asset system for 4.0, and I have to think other people could put this flexibility to creative use, I thought I should discuss possible improvements here to see if there was a consensus around how it should be implemented.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1960/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1959","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1959/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1959/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1959/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/1959","id":211297961,"number":1959,"title":"Does better sanity checking on cleanup for the splash screen closing in SDL","user":{"login":"Areloch","id":2553124,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2553124?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Areloch","html_url":"https://github.com/Areloch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Areloch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Areloch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Areloch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Areloch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Areloch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Areloch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Areloch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Areloch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Areloch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":298169718,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/Bugfix","name":"Bugfix","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":239514637,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/SDL","name":"SDL","color":"f7c6c7","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-03-02T06:05:03Z","updated_at":"2017-07-10T07:18:06Z","closed_at":"2017-03-05T08:06:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/pulls/1959","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/1959","diff_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/1959.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/1959.patch"},"body":"Does better sanity checking on cleanup for the splash screen closing with SDL.

This is because  `${libDir}/nativeFileDialogs/include`  is not added to the project include paths when `TORQUE_SDL` is disabled. I fixed this by moving `#include <nfd.h>`  to within the  `#if defined(TORQUE_SDL)` preprocessor directive.\r\n\r\nThe second compilation issue is that the compiler cannot open `al/al.h`. This is because `openal/win32` is added to the project include paths instead of `openal-soft/include`. I fixed this by updating the include paths in the core and T3D project generator modules.\r\n\r\nThe last compilation issue is that `Component::setOwner(class Entity *)`  is undefined. This is because the `T3D/components` engine source directory is not included. I fixed this by adding it to the T3D project generator module.\r\n\r\nAfter getting the program to compile it then generates a fatal error `SimObject::object missing call to SimObject::onRemove` when run without specifying a DAE file. This is because the program terminates without shutting down the platform. I fixed this by shutting down the platform before terminating.\r\n\r\nWhen you run the program again with a DAE file, it generates an error when `TSShapeLoader` initializes the `TSShape`, as there is no GFX device to initialize the vertex buffers. I fixed this by setting `TSShape::smInitOnRead` to `false` and making `TSShapeLoader` adhere to this setting when initializing the `TSShape`.\r\n\r\nAfter fixing this the program converts DAE models to DTS shapes successfully, however generates a write access violation error when the program exits. This is because the `TSShape` resource is not unloaded until it goes out of scope, after the platform has shutdown. I fixed this by adding a block scope to the `TSShape` resource to ensure it goes out of scope before the platform is shutdown.\r\n\r\nTo generate the project files I am doing the following:\r\n* Open the dae2dts directory\r\n* Run generateProjects.bat\r\n* Open the buildFiles directory\r\n* Copy torque.ico and Torque.rc from VisualStudio 2008\\projects to VisualStudio 2012\\projects\r\n* Open VisualStudio 2012\\dae2dts.sln\r\n* On the dae2dts project, go to it's properties, then:\r\n  * Change Configuration Properties -> General -> Configuration Type to `Application (.exe)`\r\n  * Change Configuration Properties -> Linker -> General -> Output File to `$(OutDir)dae2dts_DEBUG.exe`\r\n  *  Remove Configuration Properties -> Linker -> Input -> Module Definition File\r\n\r\nI am not sure if this is the correct way to fix all of these issues so please let me know if you have any feedback.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1949","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1949/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1949/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1949/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/1949","id":208784622,"number":1949,"title":"Adds

can set fog color in TheLevelInfo object as well in the ScatterSky object, the fog in the LevelInfoWorks fine until you have a ScatterSky, then the ScatterSky fog color will override the LevelInfo fog color (called fogScale in ScatterSky).\r\nThis can lead to confusion like this: https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1043\r\n\r\nBut my point in this issue is, that it also seems that the ScatterSky fog color is calculated differently, since I saw that copying the values from the LevleInfo fog color into the ScatterSky fog color gave me a vastly different result.\r\nI always try to match the fog color the sky/clouds color, so there is a very nice and smooth transition, so I set up a light blue color in the LevelInfo fog, slightly darkened until it perfectly matched the sky/clouds color, then I noticed that the ScatterSky will override it, so I thought I can simply copy the values into the ScatterSky, but the result was that in the ScatterSky was much darker and more saturated as the LevelInfo fog, I had to set it to almost bright white until it had the same color as the slightly darkened light blue.\r\nEven a 100% white color in ScatterSky fog is still too dark and too blue for me to match the sky color.\r\n\r\nSo my question is what is going on there.\r\nPossible solutions would be to adapt the ScatterSky fog to the LevelInfo fog or even better remove the fog setting in the ScatterSky since I cannot see the reason why it should be there, but I guess it is probably because of the night settings, since the ScatterSky can have day and night with whole different light and fog setups and so it has to override those values.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1948/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1947","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1947/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1947/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1947/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1947","id":207592019,"number":1947,"title":"SpawnSpheres
