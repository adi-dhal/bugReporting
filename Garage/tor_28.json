The crash happens when I try to connect from linux to a linux dedicated but also when I try to connect to it from windows. Starting the windows binary as dedicated server did also not work.\n\nAnother issue is the dedicated server does not get listed with the master server, but this may be an issue of my master server.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1275","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1275/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1275/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1275/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1275","id":69166625,"number":1275,"title":"Linux

appears with Windows XP. Using precompiled binaries.)\n\nUsing the Shape Editor tool, animation triggers can't correctly be added to new sequences created from a longer sequence if the starting point (\"in\" value) isn't zero.\n\nHow to reproduce:\nCreate a project from the Full template.\nOpen the world editor and enter the Shape Editor() tab.\nOpen Library->art/shapes/weapons/Lurker/FP_Lurker (for example)\nIn \"Properties\", in the \"Seq\" tab, select \"reload\" (highlight it). That sequence was created from between the frames 460 and 550 of the source sequence called \"timeline\".\nNow, for example, place the frame marker (of the VCR-like thing) at around the frame 500. That's correctly inside \"reload\" boundaries.\nTry to add a new trigger (press the paper icon at the side of \"Triggers\").\nYou get the error: \"Add trigger failed. Check the console for error messages.\"\nThe error message of the console says:\"TSShape::addTrigger: Keyframe out of range (0-90 for sequence 'reload')\".\nBut if the frame marker (of the VCR-like thing) is in the frame 10 -for example-, that's outside the boundaries of \"reload\" and it's the start of \"timeline\", and try to add the trigger again you get a correctly defined trigger for \"reload\" at frame 10.\n\nThe issue comes from ShapeEdSequences::onAddTrigger not taking in account the starting point of the sequence.\n\nAn example of how to fix it:\nChange the \"function ShapeEdSequences::onAddTrigger( %this ){...}\" that you can see inside ShapeEditor.ed.cs from the line 2205 with:\n\nfunction ShapeEdSequences::onAddTrigger( %this )\n{\n   // Can only add triggers if a sequence is selected\n   %seqName = ShapeEdSequenceList.getSelectedName();\n   if ( %seqName !$= \"\" )\n   {\n      // Add a new trigger at the current frame\n      %frame = mRound( ShapeEdSeqSlider.getValue() ) - %this-->startFrame.getText();\n      if ((%frame < 0) || (%frame > %this-->endFrame.getText() - %this-->startFrame.getText()))\n      {\n          MessageBoxOK( \"Error\", \"Trigger out of range of the selected animation.\" );\n      }\n      else\n      {\n          %state = ShapeEdTriggerList.rowCount() % 30;\n          ShapeEditor.doAddTrigger( %seqName, %frame, %state );\n      }\n   }\n}\n\nNote that in the repository there are two ShapeEditor.ed.cs (one for each default template):\nhttps://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/blob/development/Templates/Empty/game/tools/shapeEditor/scripts/shapeEditor.ed.cs\nhttps://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/blob/development/Templates/Full/game/tools/shapeEditor/scripts/shapeEditor.ed.cs\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1272","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1272/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1272/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1272/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1272","id":67709182,"number":1272,"title":"Feature Request: AITurret: IgnoreList - 2 addational Torque Script functions","user":{"login":"WaxyChicken","id":11641169,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/11641169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WaxyChicken","html_url":"https://github.com/WaxyChicken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WaxyChicken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WaxyChicken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WaxyChicken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WaxyChicken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WaxyChicken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WaxyChicken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WaxyChicken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WaxyChicken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WaxyChicken/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":14293078,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/New%20feature","name":"New feature","color":"5319e7","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-04-11T00:17:50Z","updated_at":"2017-05-05T00:26:51Z","closed_at":"2017-05-05T00:26:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"the ignore list is handled in Torque3D/Engine/source/T3D/turret/aiTurretShape.cpp\nthe only current functions exposed to TorqueScript are:\n\n```\n%AITurretObj.addToIgnoreList(%shapeBaseObj);\n%AITurretObj.RemoveFromIgnoreList(%shapeBaseObj);\n```\n\nthese torquescript functions would add greater control over the turret's ignore list\nand would be very useful.\n\n```\ntorque script function: \n\n%AITurretObj.ignoreListCount();\n\nreturn the number of objects in the turrets ignore list.\n\nreturns: zero based count of items in the AITurret's ignore list.\n\nexample use in torqueScript: \n%ObjectsIgnored = %AITurretObj.ignoreListCount();\n```\n\n```\ntorque script function: %AITurretObj.getIgnoreListObject( int i );\nreturns: the ignored object ID at index i of the AITurret's ignore list\n\nexample use in torqueScript: \n%IgnoredOBJ = %AITurretObj.getIgnoreListObject(2);\n\nexample returns the %obj objectID of the item 2 in the ignore list.\n```\n\nexample use of how both functions can be useful together in TorqueScript:\n\n```\n           for(%count = 0;
