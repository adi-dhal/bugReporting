TORQUE_ENABLE_UTF16_CACHE enabled, every string you happen to convert to UTF16 will be inserted into a cache (sgUTF16Cache). There is however a big problem with this, as this applies to almost every string you happen to use in the GUI and also most of the filesystem functions.\n\nIf for instance you press and hold down the \"a\" key in the console, a string of \"a\" characters will get converted to UTF16 and will be placed in the cache. On the next frame, you will have extra \"a\" characters appended to the string which will then be converted to UTF16 and be placed in the cache. This will go on and on with the size of the inserted string growing exponentially, eventually depleting available memory.\n\nOf course, you may think \"Why is this a problem? Of course filling a text box with the letter \"a\" will eventually deplete memory!\". However the problem is Torque only frees memory from the UTF16 cache when it quits. Every single version of the \"a\" string will be stuck in there (\"aa\", \"aaa\", \"aaaa\", etc).\n\nThis may also be a problem during gameplay. For instance lets say you have a timer or score counter in your GUI which increments. It's entirely possible you could run out of memory or even addressable memory depending on what happens.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1151/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1150","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1150/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1150/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1150/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1150","id":56206327,"number":1150,"title":"Fix

Actually is handled by a second module file... i dont like this.\n\nMy idea to fix the problems is each module have `if sections` for handle diferent configuration passes:\n\n```\n# test module\n\nif( MODULE_PHASE_OPTIONS )\n    option(TORQUE_THIS_IS_A_TEST \"This is a test\" OFF)\nendif()\n\nif( MODULE_PHASE_BUILDING )\n    addPathRec(\"${srcDir}/blabla\")\nendif()\n\nif( MODULE_PHASE_TARGET )\n    set_property(TARGET ${PROJECT_NAME} PROPERTY OUTPUT_NAME_${CONF} ${PROJECT_NAME}_${SUFFIX})\nendif()\n```\n\nWhat you think? \nComplicate too much module files?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1145","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1145/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1145/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1145/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/1145","id":56061571,"number":1145,"title":"Make CMake project load all .cmake files from the module folder Updated.","user":{"login":"LuisAntonRebollo","id":2388307,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2388307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo","html_url":"https://github.com/LuisAntonRebollo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":14293078,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/New%20feature","name":"New feature","color":"5319e7","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestones/4/labels","id":612993,"number":4,"title":"3.7","description":"This version will focus on processing two of the major outstanding pull requests, James Urquhart's [TorqueScript interpreter improvements](https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/81) and Tim Condon's [GUI additions](https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/545).

So you need to exercise a bit more discretion when doing \"using namespace\" or using anonymous namespaces or #defines. Also I've noticed that Visual Studio can get confused and produce errors when switching the same solution between the normal and unity configuration, so I recommend having out-of-source build directories that are dedicated to a particular config.\n\nThe unity build is currently disabled by default. My plan is to add a CI build that compiles the unity configuration so we can easily see breakages. Then, if people are keen on the idea, we can eventually switch to defaulting to the unified build. If not, I would still like to get this code in the tree so we can start using it downstream :)\n\nA lot of the changes in this branch are general cleanup that are a happy side effect of fixing the unity build - fixing include guards, removing dead or duplicated functions, and trimming unneeded declarations and \"using\" directives. I tried to separate these into commits that are more or less atomic. The commit where (most of) the conflicting identifiers were renamed is here: 02e6ada\n\nI tried to test as many configurations as possible, but things like Oculus/Hydra/etc support I wasn't able to test. If anyone is building with those configs, it would be great if they could try the branch any let me know if it's broken for them :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1138","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1138/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1138/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1138/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/1138","id":55748177,"number":1138,"title":"commit to fix issue in https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1136","user":{"login":"dragutux","id":5103764,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5103764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragutux","html_url":"https://github.com/dragutux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragutux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragutux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragutux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragutux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragutux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragutux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragutux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragutux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragutux/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-01-28T12:03:21Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T14:44:56Z","closed_at":"2015-02-18T14:44:56Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/pulls/1138","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/1138","diff_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/1138.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/1138.patch"},"body":"this fix the redefinition of uint64_t by stdint.h (in the case of bullet, it does not like it, you either have to remove stdint... or disable their specific call)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1138/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1137","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1137/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1137/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1137/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/1137","id":55738458,"number":1137,"title":"Fix changes to moveSelection API","user":{"login":"crabmusket","id":904269,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/904269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket","html_url":"https://github.com/crabmusket","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":14292474,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false},{"id":86205287,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/Final%20review","name":"Final review","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestones/4/labels","id":612993,"number":4,"title":"3.7","description":"This version will focus on processing two of the major outstanding pull requests, James Urquhart's [TorqueScript interpreter improvements](https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/81) and Tim Condon's [GUI additions](https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/545).
