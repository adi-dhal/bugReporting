It also optimizes variable assignment, so when assigning numeric variables it will no longer perform an unneccesary string conversion.\n\nRelevant benchmarking figures are available here:\n\nhttp://www.garagegames.com/community/forums/viewthread/131792/4#comment-834494\nhttp://www.garagegames.com/community/forums/viewthread/131792/5#comment-834766\n\nThe actual benchmarking code I used is here: https://gist.github.com/3760645\n\nWhile I have a few more ideas to improve the scripting engine (e.g. improving field access), I feel that changing the way script functions are binded to the engine is both significant and useful enough to make a pull request now.\n\nThis code has been tested on Windows and Linux. It has also been tested in the case of Singleplayer and Multiplayer. Unfortunately while I have tested this as much as I can, there could still be edge cases where this breaks something so I encourage anyone interested in incorporating these changes to test them against their script code.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/81/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/80","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/80/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/80/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/80/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/80","id":7549082,"number":80,"title":"GuiBitmapStringCtrl","user":{"login":"Phantom139","id":2502793,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2502793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phantom139","html_url":"https://github.com/Phantom139","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phantom139/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phantom139/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phantom139/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phantom139/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phantom139/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phantom139/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phantom139/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phantom139/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phantom139/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":14293078,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/New%20feature","name":"New feature","color":"5319e7","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2012-10-12T17:36:38Z","updated_at":"2013-06-17T18:44:23Z","closed_at":"2013-06-17T18:44:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/pulls/80","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/80","diff_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/80.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/80.patch"},"body":"Adds a new Gui Control to the engine that strings a number of images\ntogether.\n\nSee my thread on the forums here for more discussion and preview images: http://www.garagegames.com/community/forums/viewthread/131655\n\nAnd don't worry, I got it right this time with the commits. :P\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/80/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/79","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/79/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/79/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/79/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/79","id":7496136,"number":79,"title":"Add TorqueScript Prefab methods","user":{"login":"mixxit","id":233287,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/233287?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mixxit","html_url":"https://github.com/mixxit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mixxit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mixxit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mixxit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mixxit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mixxit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mixxit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mixxit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mixxit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mixxit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":14293078,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/New%20feature","name":"New feature","color":"5319e7","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2012-10-10T21:13:43Z","updated_at":"2014-04-04T21:33:18Z","closed_at":"2014-04-04T21:33:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"As displayed here -

from THREED-3147\n\nI've tried this with several different models, stock torque and otherwise. \n\nIn the process of \"cleanig up\" all my 3d assets and testing them with T3D.\n\nAll the custom models I tested load up and \"seem\" to be fine - no errors, animations work, etc.\n\nHowever, when loading them in T3D1.2 ShapeEditor ... and try to save the shape as a new dts using saveShape() function ... (even without making any changes) ... most of them caused the editor to start writing the file, then crash.\n\nThe custom models were fixed by re-importing using the COLLADA and using SingleDTS \"detection\".\n This created a LOD(2) by default – and NONE of the models had issues with saveShape() after that.\n\n... So I then proceeded to make the required mount points, eye, cam, etc ... and so on.\n\nNEXT -\n\nI then turned to the standard Torque assets ...\n\n\"Boombot\" has detail levels, but still causes a crash when trying to save in shape editor view \n//in console //\n ShapeEditor.shape.saveShape(\"./test.dts\");\n\n... Soldier, Alien saved ok \n\nThen I tried some of the models purchased from GG stores ... and had same issues as my custom art.\n It loads and works fine – but saveShape() crashed when trying to save to a new file. Even with no changes.\n And most all of that content had LODs, etc ... already built into the DTS models.\n\nCould it be an issue with DTS v24 versus v26 ? Or just a coincidence ???\n\nHere are specific steps to reproduce the crash;\n\nLoad T3D 1.2 / FPS Example \n\nHit F11, enter editor mode ... select shape editor\n load art/shapes/actors/boombot/boombot.dts\n\nopen console window, type:\n\nShapeEditor.shape.saveShape(\"newShape.dts\");\n\n...
