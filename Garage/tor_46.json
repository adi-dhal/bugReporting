Once for each possible outcome of the if-statement. It's best to try to avoid if's where possible to avoid this branching, even if it means doing some extra computations in the main body.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/733","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/733/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/733/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/733/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/733","id":37875204,"number":733,"title":"Light Managers constructed at the wrong time","user":{"login":"jamesu","id":10850,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesu","html_url":"https://github.com/jamesu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":14292474,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-07-15T11:54:27Z","updated_at":"2014-07-15T21:51:12Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In Torque3D, BasicLightManager is created in a module, i.e. \n\n```\nMODULE_BEGIN( BasicLightManager )\n   MODULE_SHUTDOWN_AFTER( Scene )\n   MODULE_INIT\n   {\n      ManagedSingleton< BasicLightManager >::createSingleton();\n   }\n   MODULE_SHUTDOWN\n   {\n      ManagedSingleton< BasicLightManager >::deleteSingleton();\n   }\nMODULE_END;\n```\n\nSimple enough. However this creates a problem with the light fields for each light object which are created via `LightManager::initLightFields()` (called from ::initPersistFields). This function iterates through each light manager and adds their fields to the object. However when ::initPersistFields is called, the module system hasn't been initialzed yet thus no fields will be added for BasicLightManager.\n\nAdvancedLightManager doesn't have this problem since it's initialized on startup outside of the module system. However this introduces another problem: depending on the order in which AdvancedLightManager is destroyed, crashes can occur due to either memory corruption or invalid objects.\n\nThere is also an additional problem with BasicLightManager if you try to \"fix\" the problem using the AdvancedLightManager approach. In the constructor, it registers several console variables however this only works when the console system has been initialized, not before.\n\nIn short, the initialization order might need a rethink.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/733/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/732","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/732/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/732/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/732/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/732","id":37784984,"number":732,"title":"Revert #540","user":{"login":"crabmusket","id":904269,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/904269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket","html_url":"https://github.com/crabmusket","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":14292474,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestones/2/labels","id":599533,"number":2,"title":"3.6","description":"This release is the first that the new Steering Committee will be responsible for.

Also, I will not port any tests that don't pass or don't test anything useful. The current [default construction](https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/blob/development/Engine/source/unit/tests/testDefaultConstruction.cpp) test of console classes is a good example of a useless test, because _not_ all console classes actually instantiate without datablocks, for example, so it's not really something we want to assert is always true.\n\nThe tests will also be moved. Unit tests should all live in a `test/` directory adjacent to the source files they test (or a reasonable location if a large system must be tested that is spread over multiple directories... though I don't think we really have any of these). Test files will be named after the source file they test with the `Test` suffix, or something reasonable if the functionality they test really is split over multiple files. For example, `Vector`, which is declared in `tVector.h` is tested by `test/tVectorTest.cpp`. `Profiler`, which is declared in `profiler.h`, is tested in `test/profilerTest.cpp`.\n\nThe contents of all test files will be wrapped in `#ifdef TORQUE_TESTS_ENABLED`.\n\nStress tests (i.e. tests which don't test for the correctness of a specific API, just try to do lots of work in hopes of breaking something) should be named `TEST(Whatever, StressSomething)` (i.e. with a `Stress` prefix to their test case name) so they can be selectively excluded.\n\nAs a policy, interactive tests are being removed. Nobody's going to bother to run them - the unit tests should focus on things that can run automatically.\n## [Working branch](https://github.com/eightyeight/Torque3D/compare/gtest-tests)\n- [x] Make GCC happy\n- [x] Add CMake support (6cc59a9)\n- [x] Remove existing unit test framework (1a5664c)\n- [x] Add a `main.cs` replacement that runs tests (e5bb218, e5bb218)\n- [x] Port component tests (21ecb6f)\n- [x] Port `Vector` tests (b480502, dbc0dff)\n- [x] Port `PlaneF` tests (2c2284e, c0851e9)\n- [x] Port matrix multiplication implementation test (7b18431)\n- [x] Port `RuntimeClassRep` test (523adea)\n- [x] Port swizzle test (2f2d7cf)\n- [x] Port threading tests (2f95583, 9601162, fb408f3, 4c76962, 93325df, b34afee)\n- [x] Port string tests (3cdfcb1)\n- [x] Port path tests (18c5c25)\n- [x] Port file tests (b34b1a7)\n- [x] Port journal and process tests (5c6d22a)\n- [x] Port fixed size deque tests (552cb87)\n- [x] Port window manager tests (fbd97b0)\n- [x] Port time manager test (eeac48b)\n- [x] Port network tests (77381ac, e6d47c5)\n- [x] Port basic types test (b43b6d2)\n- [x] Optimistically add profiler test so we can think about stopping it from leaking (56d4341)\n- [x] Remove or quarantine tests with effects or stress tests, since they won't always be appropriate (867997f, 85a0c1c)\n  -

This usually doesn't come up, I think, because of the string table. However I've managed to crash the engine by requesting an event with the wrong capitalisation. It all goes wrong here:\n\n``` cpp\nbool EventManager::subscribe(SimObject *callbackObj, const char* event, const char* callback /*= NULL */)\n{\n   // Make sure the event is valid.\n   if( !isRegisteredEvent( event ) )\n   {\n      Con::warnf( \"EventManager::subscribe - %s is not a registered event.\", event );\n      return false;\n   }\n\n   ...\n\n   Vector<EventManagerListener::Subscriber>* subscribers = mListener.mSubscribers.retreive( event );\n\n   AssertFatal( subscribers, \"Invalid event subscriber list.\" );\n\n   subscribers->push_back( subscriber );\n\n   return true;\n}\n```\n\nThe problem is that `isRegisteredEvent` uses the `StringTable`, so it makes case-insensitive comparisons:\n\n``` cpp\nbool EventManager::isRegisteredEvent( const char* event )\n{\n   // Iterate over the event list.\n   StringTableEntry eventName = StringTable->insert( event );\n   for( Vector<StringTableEntry>::const_iterator iter = mEvents.begin(); iter != mEvents.end(); iter++ )\n   {\n      // Found.\n      if( *iter == eventName )\n         return true;\n   }\n\n   // Not found.\n   return false;\n}\n```\n\nwhereas `retrieve` does not, unless `mCaseSensitive` is set to `false`. Working on a simple example that will reproduce it, but I've made a quick fix by adding this to the definition of `EventManagerListener`:\n\n``` cpp\npublic:\n   EventManagerListener(): mSubscribers(64, false) {}\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/716/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/715","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/715/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/715/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/715/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/715","id":37054557,"number":715,"title":"Fix to allow parallax mapping with dxtnm textures via the red channel.","user":{"login":"rextimmy","id":4123979,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4123979?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rextimmy","html_url":"https://github.com/rextimmy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rextimmy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rextimmy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rextimmy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rextimmy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rextimmy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rextimmy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rextimmy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rextimmy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rextimmy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":86205503,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/Defect","name":"Defect","color":"fbca04","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestones/4/labels","id":612993,"number":4,"title":"3.7","description":"This version will focus on processing two of the major outstanding pull requests, James Urquhart's [TorqueScript interpreter improvements](https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/81) and Tim Condon's [GUI additions](https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/545).
