However this is not too optimal in all cases as for instance you might have several different models with < 200 verts in them with no commonality between them.\n\nDrawing a single model with instancing is not a particularly good use of rendering time, especially in OpenGL as the renderer needs to stuff the model position in another vertex buffer, as opposed to just setting the uniform modelview.\n\nThoughts anyone?

Either way, we’re relying on compiler and linker optimizations to make this code go away.\"\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/674","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/674/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/674/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/674/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/674","id":34534914,"number":674,"title":"Fix SignalBase constructor shenanigans","user":{"login":"crabmusket","id":904269,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/904269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket","html_url":"https://github.com/crabmusket","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":86205503,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/Defect","name":"Defect","color":"fbca04","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestones/5/labels","id":621985,"number":5,"title":"Linux","description":"","creator":{"login":"LuisAntonRebollo","id":2388307,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2388307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo","html_url":"https://github.com/LuisAntonRebollo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":12,"state":"closed","created_at":"2014-04-06T20:21:53Z","updated_at":"2015-06-25T03:38:34Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2015-06-25T03:38:34Z"},"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-05-29T07:46:12Z","updated_at":"2014-07-08T12:37:40Z","closed_at":"2014-06-15T19:24:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/pulls/674","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/674","diff_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/674.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/674.patch"},"body":"Fixes #673.

This also adds a SimpleDataQueue class to the engine (let me know if I somehow missed an already-existing streaming queued buffer class!).\n\nAll connected TCPObject instances are processed in the run loop to ensure all data has been sent. The send queue is iterated until either the queue is empty or the TCP layer stops sending bytes through.\n\nDue to the varying mysterious nature of send buffers in TCP implementations it is advised that this code is tested simulating a pretty bad connection to ensure the buffer is actually made use of.
