The docblock parsing rule was looking for `///` then anything not `/`, then a bunch of characters till a newline. That means it would see this:\n\n```\n////\nfunction hello() {}\n```\n\nas all being on one line, if using Linux newlines (because the `\\n` matched the single 'not `/`', then the function definition matched the next line.\n\nThis PR corrects the issue by doing two things. First, it makes the rule stricter, by requiring that the next character after a `///` not be any of `/`, `\\n` and `\\r`. This stops the issue, but would mean that all docblocks had to have a character after the `///`. Second, we make the entire contents of the line optional. This allows empty docblock lines.\n\nOh, I also changed the newline spec at the end to be `[\\n\\r]+` instead of `[\\n\\r]*` which seems more sensible.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1219","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1219/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1219/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1219/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1219","id":58486109,"number":1219,"title":"Mac OSX Terrain does not render in release mode","user":{"login":"JeffProgrammer","id":4423768,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4423768?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeffProgrammer","html_url":"https://github.com/JeffProgrammer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeffProgrammer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeffProgrammer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeffProgrammer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeffProgrammer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeffProgrammer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeffProgrammer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeffProgrammer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeffProgrammer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeffProgrammer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":14292474,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false},{"id":174909355,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/OSX","name":"OSX","color":"f7c6c7","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2015-02-22T01:48:33Z","updated_at":"2015-07-15T05:33:39Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Terrain renders fine in debug, but when it compiles in release, terrain just does not render properly at all.

we were defaulting to vsync=off, but in recent versions\nof windows this is often a bad idea because desktop compositing (\"aero\")\neffectively enforces a vsync in windowed modes, regardless of our\npresentation interval. So turning on vsync in those cases is beneficial\nbecause we won't waste CPU effort rendering frames that are just going to\nbe discarded by the OS anyways, and frame rate displays will more\naccurately represent what the user is actually seeing on the monitor.\n\nTo solve this, the engine now tracks separate fullscreen and windowed\nvsync modes. Fullscreen defaults to vsync=off. Windowed modes default to\nvsync=on if desktop composition is detected, and off otherwise. These\nsettings are stored in the vsyncFullscreen and vsyncWindowed config\nvariables. The settings are:\n\n0 : vsync disabled\n1 : vsync enabled\n2 : auto vsync (default)\n\nThese variables aren't intended to be changed directly, and they don't\nappear in the graphic options. Any changes to the vsync setting via the\ngraphics options will removed the \"auto\" behavior, and this can only be\nrestored by resetting or editing the config by hand.\n\nThe old vsync config variable now only acts as an abstraction to minimize the amount of code that needs to know about the two different vsyncs, and it's been renamed to $video::disableVerticalSync so it won't be persisted.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1212","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1212/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1212/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1212/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/1212","id":58338171,"number":1212,"title":"Fixed SDL related header includes for linux","user":{"login":"pbrand","id":10218701,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10218701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrand","html_url":"https://github.com/pbrand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":14292474,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false},{"id":174909347,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/Linux","name":"Linux","color":"f7c6c7","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestones/4/labels","id":612993,"number":4,"title":"3.7","description":"This version will focus on processing two of the major outstanding pull requests, James Urquhart's [TorqueScript interpreter improvements](https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/81) and Tim Condon's [GUI additions](https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/545).
