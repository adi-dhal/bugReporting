It provides three classes that can be used in games. TSPathShape is a simple path following shape. TSAttachable builds on TSPathShape to add the ability for players to walk on the shape while it's moving. The script interface for this class is almost identical to the traditional PathShape. The setup is slightly different. Since the DataBlock has been eliminated, the shape file is set in the editor. The WalkableShape class is a simple shape object that players can walk on while it's moving. It provides no movement of it's own, but can be mounted to...Anything! So if you want to walk on the back of a flatbed truck, model the bed as a separate shape and mount it to the truck in game as a WalkableShape. It can be mounted to any shape that provides movement. There is a demo level included that has a platform-jumping mini-game and a Cheetah with a platform mounted to the roof where the turret normally mounts. You'll need two connections to try that though.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/960/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/959","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/959/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/959/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/959/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/959","id":49976728,"number":959,"title":"Asset downloader","user":{"login":"Winterleaf","id":2428260,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2428260?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Winterleaf","html_url":"https://github.com/Winterleaf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Winterleaf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Winterleaf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Winterleaf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Winterleaf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Winterleaf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Winterleaf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Winterleaf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Winterleaf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Winterleaf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":14293078,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/New%20feature","name":"New feature","color":"5319e7","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2014-11-25T04:53:51Z","updated_at":"2015-06-24T09:18:38Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/pulls/959","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/959","diff_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/959.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/959.patch"},"body":"This PR provides a mechanism for synchronizing files between the client and the server.\nIt does allow users to upload content to the server if the file transfer connection is left connected.\nThe code is implemented using the TCPObject as the base class.  I have taken the liberty to make a couple of TCPObject's functions virtual so I could overload them for binary transfer.\nI also modified fileSystemFunctions.cpp and took the body of code out each of the defineconsolefunctions and put them in a function and wrapped all the functions inside a namespace.  I also added a header file which can be included so that programmers are able to access those functions from anywhere in the code base.\nSince the FileXfer occurs over TCP,  I am able to use the same port which is used for the game.
