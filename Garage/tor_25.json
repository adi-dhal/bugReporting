A method `hasExecuted` on `WorkItem` to see if the item has finished executing.\n2. A method `waitForAllItems` on `ThreadPool` to block until no items are currently executing.\n\nThis lets you use the `ThreadPool` completely synchronously, as demonstrated by the new tests.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1345","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1345/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1345/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1345/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1345","id":93064980,"number":1345,"title":"Arch Linux segfault during GuiCanvas creation","user":{"login":"crabmusket","id":904269,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/904269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket","html_url":"https://github.com/crabmusket","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":14292474,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false},{"id":174909347,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/Linux","name":"Linux","color":"f7c6c7","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-07-05T01:29:07Z","updated_at":"2015-12-11T05:20:16Z","closed_at":"2015-12-11T05:20:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"See gdb log [here](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/06543aa1da344ab43fd7).
