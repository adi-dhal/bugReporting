It should have just 4 elements, because (as it's said in the comments) the algorithm  should add every knot and whenever the spline length and segment length deviate by epsilon. This is not happening, look it has lots of elements (43):\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2324012/5798955/454955b4-9fcd-11e4-967e-5eb2f07b30f5.png)\n\nApplying this changes the algorithm do what should do:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2324012/5798988/82194530-9fcd-11e4-8af8-3940a28397ee.png)\n\nAnd the spline is shown and work properly:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2324012/5799016/af960430-9fcd-11e4-8e75-9cd1a1cfb8c9.png)\nMoving a knot:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2324012/5799023/c0de59fe-9fcd-11e4-84e7-13d3164e7cf6.png)\nHope it helps!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1112","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1112/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1112/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1112/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1112","id":54715759,"number":1112,"title":"Reduce duplication in script templates","user":{"login":"crabmusket","id":904269,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/904269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket","html_url":"https://github.com/crabmusket","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":86205503,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/Defect","name":"Defect","color":"fbca04","default":false},{"id":14293078,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/New%20feature","name":"New feature","color":"5319e7","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"crabmusket","id":904269,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/904269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket","html_url":"https://github.com/crabmusket","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"crabmusket","id":904269,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/904269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket","html_url":"https://github.com/crabmusket","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-01-19T00:07:01Z","updated_at":"2016-03-28T06:47:41Z","closed_at":"2016-03-28T06:47:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As per [this forum thread](http://www.garagegames.com/community/forums/viewthread/140846), we will introduce a Packages folder to split duplicated script modules into single locations. For example, where we now have something like:\n\n```\nTemplates/\n    Full/\n        tools/\n    Empty/\n        tools/\n```\n\nThis change will result in:\n\n```\nTemplates/\n    Full/\n    Empty/\nPackages/\n    Editor/\n        tools/\n```\n\nWhen a project is created, desired packages are copied into the project directory the same way templates currently are. This means that instead of changing template scripts in two locations, the package can be changed, and all templates will benefit from the update.\n\nThis change will be fully backwards-compatible with 3.6 at the project level - i.e. a project created in 3.7 will look identical to a project created in 3.6. However, user modifications to the templates will have to be ported to the appropriate package.\n\nFor associated project generator changes, and an explanation of how templates specify which packages they need, see GarageGames/Torque3D-ProjectManager#36.\n\nThe major downside to this change will be that CMake does not currently handle the `template.xml` parsing and file copying needed to replace the work the project generator will do. We view this tradeoff as acceptable; CMake is still pretty much an 'experienced-users-only' option at the moment, and we're sure they can handle a couple of extra copy/pastes when creating a new project. Eventually, CMake will not be responsible for anything to do with the templates, anyway.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1111","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1111/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1111/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1111/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/1111","id":54709289,"number":1111,"title":"Linux","user":{"login":"LuisAntonRebollo","id":2388307,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2388307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo","html_url":"https://github.com/LuisAntonRebollo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuisAntonRebollo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":14293078,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/New%20feature","name":"New
