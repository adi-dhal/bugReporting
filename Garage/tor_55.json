With a dead zone enabled a bound command to an action map should still receive a value in the range of 0..1 but instead it is something other than 0 (for the current defaults it is about 0.3..1).\n\nsim/actionMap.cpp at line 1510 should read as follows:\n\n```\n               if( value > 0 )\n                  value = ( value - pNode->deadZoneEnd ) * ( 1.f / ( 1.f - pNode->deadZoneEnd

this:\n\n```\n         if ( pNode->flags & Node::HasDeadZone )\n         {\n            if ( value >= pNode->deadZoneBegin &&\n                 value <= pNode->deadZoneEnd )\n               value = 0.0f;\n            else\n            {\n               if( value > 0 )\n                  value = ( value - pNode->deadZoneEnd ) * ( 1.f / ( 1.f - pNode->deadZoneEnd ) );\n               else\n

a much smoother gamepad and joystick experience.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/468/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/467","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/467/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/467/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/467/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/467","id":18004701,"number":467,"title":"Export

This caused undesired results.\n\nInstead of HTTPObject::onLine containing just the response data, it also included the full HTTP header. I assume this was not the intended functionality because HTTPObject's processLine was never getting called and fixing it gave me the output that I expected from an HTTP helper class.\n\nThere is also an issue where the data returned from the server requires a new line appended to the end, but that problem is happening in TCPObject.\n\nAnother issue is that HTTPObject seems to leave the socket connection open after receiving the response from the server.

Setup a path w/ pathnodes and spawn an ai player to that path, following that path. I used 7 nodes in a circular formation so I could ensure that when I selected checked the isLooping flag on the path in the editor, that the ai would pay attention. Once your ai is following the path you'll notice they do slow down at each of those nodes in the path. Make sure to save your level. Then apply the fix and reload your game and test level. Respawn the ai on the path again and watch them follow the path, but notice they don't slow down anymore at each node. If is looping is checked the ai will not slow down at any of the nodes. Now uncheck islooping on the path so it won't loop and do this before you ai reaches the second to last node. Notice now, that the ai will slow down while approaching the last node in that path. If you recheck islooping on the path, the ai will just resume following the path and continue from it's position.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/456","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/456/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/456/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/456/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/456","id":17630239,"number":456,"title":"Heap corruption caused by incorrect Torque Script naming","user":{"login":"smally","id":2424587,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2424587?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smally","html_url":"https://github.com/smally","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smally/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smally/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smally/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smally/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smally/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smally/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smally/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smally/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smally/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2013-08-05T11:28:48Z","updated_at":"2014-07-28T18:16:27Z","closed_at":"2013-10-09T20:06:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/pulls/456","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/456","diff_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/456.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/456.patch"},"body":"Adds a check to make sure a dynamic variable won't be named the same as a ts class name.

is replacement for generating compile solution for Torque3D on Windows x86. Currently system is supporting only Win x86, but I will soon update code with additional support for Unix. Also I would like to say that I am not owner of Mac so I cannot update cMake system for full Mac support.\n\nI have increased minimum required version of cMake (to 2.8.11) because of possibility to generate new Visual Studio 2013 Preview solutions. On my initial testing and using whole cMake system was working OK without big problems. \n\nIf there are problems please say so I can fix this.\n\nEDIT:\nI have included new version of Bullet library. Reasons for that was because I had enormous problems with old build and getting cMake to work nicely with T3D and Bullet.\nPersonally I don't believe that this should be really big problem with integrating cMake and Bullet in one pull request. But its possible that I am wrong.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/444/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/443","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/443/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/443/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/443/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/443","id":17172343,"number":443,"title":"Enable DirectX 9Ex implementation inside DirectX9 renderer","user":{"login":"TheDushan","id":1044004,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1044004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheDushan","html_url":"https://github.com/TheDushan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheDushan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheDushan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheDushan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheDushan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheDushan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheDushan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheDushan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheDushan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheDushan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":86205503,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/Defect","name":"Defect","color":"fbca04","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestones/2/labels","id":599533,"number":2,"title":"3.6","description":"This release is the first that the new Steering Committee will be responsible for.
