bumped into an issue with the console logger in a project. If we have the following situation:\n\nThread 1: Con::printf(\"One\");\nThread 2: Con::printf(\"Two\");\nThread 3: Con::printf(\"Three\");\n\nUsually you'd expect the following to be sent through to the consumers, in whatever order the threads manage to call the consumer:\n\n```\nOne\nTwo\nThree\n```\n\nDepending on the timing of these threads you may get the following sent to the consumers:\n\n```\nOne\nThree\n```\n\nIn console.cpp we have:\n\n```\nstatic void _printf(ConsoleLogEntry::Level level, ConsoleLogEntry::Type type, const char* fmt, va_list argptr)\n{\n   if (!active)\n       return;\n   Con::active = false; \n```\n\nEssentially the \"active\" check is just a check to prevent a recursion later on in the code. What is happening is since there is no synchronization in _printf, Thread 1 may set active to true causing Thread 2 to ignore the print, while Thread 3 may find active is false again as Thread 1 has finished printing the entry.\n\nIf you have the log buffer enabled or the console, you'll likely get a crash as yet again there is no synchronization whatsoever when pushing the log entry to the console log.\n\nIn my case since I don't use any of the console stuff (just the consumer list) I solved the issue by just having a lock on the consumer, but I figured maybe a better solution is needed for Torque3D...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/390/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/389","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/389/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/389/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/389/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/389","id":14556693,"number":389,"title":"castRay() from inside geometry has different behaviors","user":{"login":"lornemcintosh","id":484902,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/484902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lornemcintosh","html_url":"https://github.com/lornemcintosh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lornemcintosh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lornemcintosh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lornemcintosh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lornemcintosh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lornemcintosh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lornemcintosh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lornemcintosh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lornemcintosh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lornemcintosh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":86205503,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/Defect","name":"Defect","color":"fbca04","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestones/3","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestone/3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestones/3/labels","id":599534,"number":3,"title":"4.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"crabmusket","id":904269,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/904269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket","html_url":"https://github.com/crabmusket","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":8,"closed_issues":31,"state":"open","created_at":"2014-03-17T04:53:52Z","updated_at":"2017-02-24T17:24:28Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":2,"created_at":"2013-05-21T08:31:09Z","updated_at":"2014-03-31T00:04:25Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've been relying (for better or worse) on the fact that SceneContainer::castRay() used to return true, and set rayInfo.t = 0 (as if it hit something immediately) when ray-casting from inside a .dif interior to some point outside.\n\nIn T3D 3.0 interiors are history, and I've noticed that castRay() has totally different behavior for TSStatics.
