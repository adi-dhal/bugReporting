Somewhere an axis ends up being negative when it was positive. This doesn't happen when passing it an angle axis.\n\nI didn't really change the existing code to fix it, because I didn't have time to look at it real close, but instead commented it out and just wrote my own based on(http://www.euclideanspace.com/maths/geometry/rotations/conversions/eulerToQuaternion/index.htm):\n    // Assuming the angles are in radians.\n    F32 c1 = mCos(e.y/2.0f);\n    F32 s1 = mSin(e.y/2.0f);\n    F32 c2 = mCos(e.z/2.0f);\n    F32 s2 = mSin(e.z/2.0f);\n    F32 c3 = mCos(e.x/2.0f);\n    F32 s3 = mSin(e.x/2.0f);\n    F32 c1c2 = c1_c2;\n    F32 s1s2 = s1_s2;\n    w =c1c2_c3 - s1s2_s3;\n    x =c1c2_s3 + s1s2_c3;\n    y =s1_c2_c3 + c1_s2_s3;\n    z =c1_s2_c3 - s1_c2_s3;\n\nThat should fix it. Also I don't don't if there was originally a QuatD class, but I made one so if there is change it respectively there as well.\n\nOnce I figure out a workflow for submitting fixes on here I will start making these changes myself, but don't really have the time at work yet.\n\nAlso if you want something to test with just use this:\nEulerF eRot(0.0f, -0.0f, 1.5707963267948966f);\nQuatD rot(eRot);\n\nYou will notice rot has a negative 0.7071067811... which is incorrect, then if you use this:\nEulerF eRot(0.0f, -0.0f, 1.5707963267948966f);\nMatrixF mat(eRot);\nAngAxisF aaRot(mat);\nQuatD rot(aaRot);\n\nyou will get something like this: \"0.00000000000000000 0.00000000000000000 0.70710678118654746 0.70710678118654757\"\n\nI was using doubles (F64) the entire time so that is why my values are huge.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/164/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/163","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/163/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/163/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/163/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/163","id":9035002,"number":163,"title":"Material Editor Crash- Opening the material editor with a mesh selected doesn't open a custom material.

This came about because TSForestItemData::_getShapeInstance() is creating a shape instance and always loading the materials.  While issue #155 is a good fix, it may be able to be better.\n\nNormally when a shape instance is created the materials are only loaded on the client.  TSForestItemData::_getShapeInstance() goes against this and creates the materials regardless of being on the client or server.  It appears to do this so it can check if it needs to add the wind effect to the shape.\n\nHowever, the wind effect should be a client side only effect and I don't believe it needs to be checked on the server.

I dont know if it has been fixed since i last merged in changes from the T3D dev branch for linux dedicated server but there is a bug with the Forest object and NULL GFX device. The actual bug has to do with imposters which the forest object uses. If you look in ts/tsShapeInstance.cpp in the function void TSShapeInstance::buildInstanceData(TSShape *_shape, bool loadMaterials) at the very end you will see:\n\n```\nif (loadMaterials && mShapeResource)   \n    mShape->setupBillboardDetails( mShapeResource.getPath().getFullPath() );\n```\n\nThe issue is that setupBillboardDetails should not run on a null GFX device (and the other time it is ran, there is a check for that)\n\nSo to fix it just change the code to this:\n\n```\nif (loadMaterials && mShapeResource && GFXDevice::devicePresent())   \n    mShape->setupBillboardDetails( mShapeResource.getPath().getFullPath() );\n```\n\n -Tim \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/154","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/154/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/154/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/154/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/154","id":8614457,"number":154,"title":"TypeValidator Memory Leak","user":{"login":"DavidWyand-GG","id":2207167,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2207167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG","html_url":"https://github.com/DavidWyand-GG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidWyand-GG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2012-11-23T19:09:11Z","updated_at":"2013-02-05T19:08:37Z","closed_at":"2013-02-05T19:08:37Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"As pointed out in this blog: http://www.garagegames.com/community/blogs/view/22008 the way ParticleData and ParticleEmitterData implement type validators is likely causing a memory leak.
