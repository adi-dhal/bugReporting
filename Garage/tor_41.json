This patch reduces the minimum width to 32, allowing some tabs to shrink to fit their text, and allowing all tabs to remain in the same line.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/886/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/885","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/885/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/885/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/885/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/885","id":47672695,"number":885,"title":"Version

They function slightly differently, but similarly enough that they could concievably be merged. Key differences:\n- `EventManager` allows subscriptions to just specific events, not entire queues\n- `ScriptMsgListener` is only useful with the dispatcher functions, not `EventManager`, which doesn't fire its callbacks\n- The dispatcher uses global functions, but the `EventManager` still has to use global queue names\n- `EventManager` provides utilities for showing current events and subscribers... though only by printing them to the

It is a huge put off for several reasons:\n- People want to make a games, not to learn new domain-specific languages that they're not going to use afterwards (a worst case example: anura engine's Frogatto Formula Language. for bonus, it's almost pure functional, further alienating people)\n- Not easy to find \"libraries\", \"snippets\" etc. for a domain specific language like TorqueScript. (also not even visible on sites like stackoverflow etc.)\n- It's not the best language out there, by large.\n\nI don't want to point to a particular language, there are various very popular (in gamedev world), well-known language with fast enough implementation and compatible license.\n\nPossible such languages are\n- Lua (LuaJIT, MIT license): used by countless games and game engines out there.\n- Javascript/ECMAScript (V8, BSD license): arguably the most popular language of the day, used by Unity and others.\n- C# (Mono, runtime libraries are licensed under LGPL): again, a very popular language today and also popular among Unity users. This is in particular a good alternative for people who prefer static typing for more robust code.\n- Python\n\nAnd maybe some others. There are some \"niche\" languages (such as squirrel) used by a few projects and some few people know _about_ them (fewer actually know the language itself), but they're either not wide-spread/well-known or don't have a performant implementation with a compatible license.\n\nPlease consider this issue seriously. This has a very serious and direct effect on Torque3D's popularity.\n\n---\n\n_A note about Mono and LGPL:_  Mono is licensed under and not GPL, which means even for closed-source projects, you _only_ need to provide object files, not the source code, or just use dynamic linking; it is very well doable with PC/Linux/Mac/Android. And as of version 8 iOS, you can bundle dynamic libraries as well.\n\nA similar situation happens when you try to ship programs using Qt (a library licensed under LGPL), and here is their official explanation on the issue:  http://qt-project.org/wiki/Licensing-talk-about-mobile-platforms\n\n>  Qt for Android / Necessitas\n> \n> As Qt for Android uses the LGPL version of Qt, and it’s perfectly possible (and also recommended and supported) to dynamically link in the Qt libraries when creating an app – there are no problems for app developers using Qt for Android. The app developers can develop closed source code and publish the app – no worries.\n> \n> Only if you statically link with the Qt libs could there be a problem with closed source apps.\n> \n> Qt for iOS\n> \n> On iOS it is possible to use a dynamically linked version of the Qt libraries, and have them bundled with the application. This allows the app to use the LGPL license for Qt whilst allowing the app itself to be closed source. It remains to be seen whether Apple will accept applications that bundle dylibs into the iOS App Store. If Apple does not accept applications that use bundled dylibs into the App Store, then it will be necessary to link Qt statically to the application. And as the Qt for iOS port uses the LGPL version of Qt, the rules for statically linking with LGPL will kick in – this can be a problem for closed source apps.\n\n(Note that this was written prior to iOS 8, whence dynlibs are allowed).\n\nIf for some reason one needs to link Mono statically nevertheless (are there such platforms? PSVita maybe?), then the developer can manually license it from Xamarin. Not that such platforms are supported by Torque3D as of today anyway.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/865/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/864","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/864/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/864/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/864/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/864","id":46784433,"number":864,"title":"Post-process shader","user":{"login":"raichu","id":3126046,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3126046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raichu","html_url":"https://github.com/raichu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raichu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raichu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raichu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raichu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raichu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raichu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raichu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raichu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raichu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":94970254,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/Docs%20/%20examples","name":"Docs / examples","color":"207de5","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-10-24T21:14:18Z","updated_at":"2014-10-24T23:30:43Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I've spend the past 2 hours trying to figure out \"how do I add my own post-process shader\".\nI'm sorry but the documentation is nowhere near helpful (Not only in this particular topic, but in general., Pretty pretty please improve the documentation overall).\n\nCould anyone tell me how?\n(I did try the forums, but the signal-to-noise ratio was not good enough)\n\nIt think it's also a good idea if you ship an example with the tree.\n\nAlso, it was quite hard to believe that there is no in-depth tutorial on using shaders.
