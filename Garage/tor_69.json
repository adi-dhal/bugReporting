It helps us port core files.\n\nThere are enough regression tests we could include that would quickly exceed our quotas. The solution is RTS, ray-traced scenes, but that discussion, I know, is off-topic here.\n\nThe COLLADA profile attribute lets us choose between library arrays, so that file is optional. The intent is obvious, and I am not that kind of minecraft-bitcoin base advocate. I did, however, consider the build-button with bit-coin code-behind on the completion dialogue.\n\nThis may mean nothing after any aspect of the OSI event has past, yet in my experience gg may want to wrap string dates with in $ comments. It is good exercise for the semantic recollection process. We can batch string replacement statements. My preference is by schema techniques rather than by semantic reflection. Our code arguments would often collide.\n\nInventory systems do not collide, and language skills should not be an issue in the presence of $. Every optimization is another technique definition.\n\n$infinite = \"Mathematic infinite.\"\n\nAccept quotes, like spoken speech, or we will never understand each other. I think of an OSI event more like forged steel that takes awhile to cool. At this point, I reconsidered jsLinux as one of your targets for T3D.EXE. It would be ideal for .ts files, and your target may reflect generated profiles.\n\nI know, an issue, so I am back in my corner with it to lay this out by license nodes, like another library choice by n-profile and n-technique.\n\nSorry, this is not blog grade. This is my spin on xs:String transitions. \"I'm trying to stay out of your core due to license issues.\" I like the general rule of thumb that every string entry is an asset, which activates the $ character in library-script context, like some bit flipped for tainted input.\n\nConvex-meshes have that input context. Other than that, it was code-shopping.dae in here.

If for example you put a breakpoint in \"EditTSCtrl::consoleInit()\", you'll notice its called at least 12 times. For \"ShapeBase::consoleInit()\", 8 times.\n\nThe issue seems to be when you don't override consoleInit in a derived class the ConcreteClassRep helper ends up calling the nearest implementation in a base class. Since ::consoleInit() is only usually used to define global variables, the extra calls are essentially redundant.\n\ne.g.\n\n```\n// Calls MyConsoleObject::consoleInit during console init, great!\nclass MyConsoleObject : SimObject {\n   static void consoleInit();\n};\n\n// Calls MyConsoleObject::consoleInit() during console init, ...\nclass MyDerivedConsoleObject : MyConsoleObject {\n};\n\n// Still calls MyConsoleObject::consoleInit() during console init, ...\nclass MyOtherConsoleObject : MyDerivedConsoleObject {\n};\n```\n\nPossible solutions:\n\n1) Create an empty consoleInit function in the next derived class.\n\n2) Use a more flat class hierarchy.\n\n3) Expose consoleInit in some other way which prevents this duplication.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/36/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/35","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/35/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/35/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/35/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/35","id":7140674,"number":35,"title":"Spawnsphere option to set spawned object's transform","user":{"login":"crabmusket","id":904269,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/904269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket","html_url":"https://github.com/crabmusket","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crabmusket/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2012-09-26T03:40:31Z","updated_at":"2012-09-26T03:41:35Z","closed_at":"2012-09-26T03:41:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/pulls/35","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/35","diff_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/35.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/35.patch"},"body":"This commit adds a flag to SpawnSphere that makes it set its spawned object's transform to its own transform upon spawning.
