guys.\n\nLately I was experimenting with terrain sizes. After I change square size to something higher than '1', terrain collisions stop working correctly. It looks like terrain collision mesh isn't recalculated to new terrain size or something. So if I am moving my player towards the terrain he eventually falls off the ground. Below you can find screen with player collision debug turned on:\n\n![torque3d_terrain_bug](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/606711/10120227/d4d50468-64b1-11e5-9bdc-0c38a27da7b6.jpg)\n\nYou can see pink wireframes of collision mesh for player. Player is facing the right side of the screen. As you can see, collision mesh is no longer calculated in front of him, so if I move it further he will fall down.\n\nI checked and this seems to appear in Torque 3.8 RC and 3.7 also.\n\nI'm running Windows 10\nATI Radeon 6850\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1427/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1426","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1426/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1426/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1426/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/1426","id":108415808,"number":1426,"title":"backend
