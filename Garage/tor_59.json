My system lacks a full 32bit development environment, but I can get up to linking with this.  Some commits in here (type stuff) set the stage so that 64bit compilation can proceed on Linux, which is probably where I'll move next.\n\nThere's some types/code in x86UNIXOGLVideo.h that got added just to make things compile. The \"Resolution\" struct for example; \"DisplayDevice\" too.  It seems like these _should_ exist elsewhere in Torque, but I couldn't find them.  Or perhaps there was an API update long ago, and this whole directory was bitrotting?  I would appreciate some guidance/input/help here!\n\njust-bank had some patches posted in:\n   http://www.garagegames.com/community/forums/viewthread/132085\nthat never made it in.  I tried to use \"author\" to attribute those properly, but I might have mixed things up a bit.  Happy to change things if someone can point out where I've made mistakes.\n\nThe 3 other commits by other authors exist in GG/Torque3D's \"master\" but not in \"development\", so I managed to pull them along for the ride.  They seem like they should actually be in development too, anyway, so I left them in.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/349","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/349/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/349/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/349/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/349","id":13345027,"number":349,"title":"Shapebase
