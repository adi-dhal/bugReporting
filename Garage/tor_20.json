I added a Rollout system in that page to be able to add more PostFX later.\n-Added a Color Ramp image preview for the selected image.\n\nAdded a missing Profile for Rollout, in case user want to call the Gui with no tools. The GuiRolloutProfile is set in editor so I created a GuiRolloutCoreProfile for in-game use.\n\nThis is my first pull request and I hope it's correct. I could have update the PostFXManager more to look better and would do on request.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1499","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1499/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1499/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1499/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/1499","id":126304970,"number":1499,"title":"Decal Fade Does Not Work","user":{"login":"SteveYorkshire","id":2613508,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2613508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveYorkshire","html_url":"https://github.com/SteveYorkshire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveYorkshire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveYorkshire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveYorkshire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveYorkshire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveYorkshire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveYorkshire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveYorkshire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveYorkshire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteveYorkshire/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-01-12T23:42:16Z","updated_at":"2016-01-25T00:52:17Z","closed_at":"2016-01-25T00:52:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Whilst hunting around decals I noticed that the fade does not work.
