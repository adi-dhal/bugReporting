The issue was that the DirectX runtime requires a function that is no longer present in MSVC 2015. However, Microsoft was nice enough to add a legacy compatibility library to continue using it, so linking against that fixes the linker errors and it works again.\n\nHowever, we have to check for MSVC 2015, and to do that requires CMake 3.1.4 as that is when they added MSVC14 macro. If that is not okay, I can come up with a solution to keep backwards compatibility, but c'mon its 2016.

a bit ago I was looking over how DSO's are processed and I noticed this line:\n\nhttps://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/blob/development/Engine/source/console/codeBlock.cpp#L438\n\nIt seems to indicate that the engine just inserts a blank into the string table when you've read bad string table offsets from the DSO file. Shouldn't this indicate an error condition that the engine might want to instead ditch the DSO and print an error for? I'm not wholly familiar with how the engine is operating (as this may actually be desirable behavior for reasons I can't quite see?) otherwise I would've made this a pull
