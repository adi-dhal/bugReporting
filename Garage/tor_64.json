am trying to implement a library called Triton Ocean SDK as a Torque 3D module. Unfortunately it throws build errors if I don't specify the Debug lib when doing a debug build. Also I get build errors unless I specify MSVCRT in the \"Ignore Specific Default Libraries\".\n\nSo, what I did was add a 2nd parameter to addProjectLibInput(), the first parameter is the normal lib, the 2nd parameter is the debug lib. The debug lib defaults to null. If the debug lib is null, it uses the release lib for both (This will make it so none of the current modules break.)\n\nFor the 2nd problem, I added a new function called addProjectIgnoreDefaultLib().
