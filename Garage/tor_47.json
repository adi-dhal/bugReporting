This makes googletest available for use if you add the `testing` module in your project config file - i.e., `includeModule('testing')`. It defines `TORQUE_TESTS_ENABLED`, with which you should wrap all of your unit tests. It also defines two convenience macros. While before, tests with fixtures would look like this:\n\n``` c++\nclass VectorFixture : public ::testing::Test\n{\n   protected: Vector<S32> v, u;\n};\n\nTEST_F(VectorFixture, Length)\n{\n   EXPECT_EQ(v.length(), u.length());\n}\n```\n\nThey can now look like:\n\n``` c++\nFIXTURE(Vector)\n{\n   protected: Vector<S32> v, u;\n};\n\nTEST_FIX(Vector, Length)\n{\n   EXPECT_EQ(v.length(), u.length());\n}\n```\n\nSo we can use actual class names in test names, which I think makes for clearer code with less noise and repetition (i.e. no more `TEST(ClassTest`).\n\nNote: currently tests will fail due to a 'memory leak' caused by `Con::printf` as noted [here](http://www.garagegames.com/community/forums/viewthread/136563/1#comment-858975). The solution is to set `$Con::LogBufferEnabled` to `false` before running tests. This means you won't be able to see the output in the console window in-engine, and will have to check the results in `console.log` after closing the engine.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/705","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/705/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/705/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/705/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/705","id":36315774,"number":705,"title":"Fix for unexpected behavior described in issue #704","user":{"login":"andr3wmac","id":862932,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/862932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andr3wmac","html_url":"https://github.com/andr3wmac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andr3wmac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andr3wmac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andr3wmac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andr3wmac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andr3wmac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andr3wmac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andr3wmac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andr3wmac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andr3wmac/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":14292474,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false},{"id":86205287,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/labels/Final%20review","name":"Final review","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/milestones/4/labels","id":612993,"number":4,"title":"3.7","description":"This version will focus on processing two of the major outstanding pull requests, James Urquhart's [TorqueScript interpreter improvements](https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/81) and Tim Condon's [GUI additions](https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/pull/545).

This is fine for drawing stuff such as the GUI and debug elements, but not so suitable for drawing prepared objects such as particle emitters and skinned shapes.\n\nFor instance, lets say the following:\n- We have 3 particle emitters which have a GFXBufferTypeVolatile buffer of 100 verts each\n- The storage buffer which backs each volatile buffer is 400 verts long, and is currently at position 300\n\nIf we start preparing verts for all 3 of our particle emitters, what will happen is as follows:\n- Emitter 1 will allocate 100 verts at position 300\n- Emitter 2 will detect we are at the end of the buffer, set the position back to 0, and _DISCARD_ the entire buffer, and allocate 100 verts at position 0\n- Emitter 3 will allocate 100 verts at position 100\n\nWhen we render these emitters in the render bins, Emitter 1 will essentially be rendering from junk data since Emitter 2 discarded the buffer.\n\nIdeally there needs to be another vertex buffer type such as GFXBufferTypeVolatileFrame which works like GFXBufferTypeVolatile with the following differences:\n- If the buffer marker passes the end, look for another storage buffer of the same vertex format.\n- If no storage buffer is found, allocate a new one\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/684/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/683","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/683/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/683/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/683/events","html_url":"https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D/issues/683","id":34888801,"number":683,"title":"projectGenerator.command \"PHP Fatal error:  Cannot redeclare class Generator\"","user":{"login":"jmullentech","id":6288707,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6288707?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmullentech","html_url":"https://github.com/jmullentech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmullentech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmullentech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmullentech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmullentech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmullentech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmullentech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmullentech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmullentech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmullentech/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-06-03T18:07:12Z","updated_at":"2014-11-07T08:53:29Z","closed_at":"2014-11-07T08:53:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"http://pastebin.com/TsY6rqnL\n\nI would try to push a commit with the modified files but I have no clue how to do so.
