the editor, i would appreciate the ability to view all invisible/hidden nodes (by \"Invisible/Hidden\", i mean visual nodes (Sprites, Meshes etc.) that have been hidden by their node properties) without actually affecting their node properties, thus making it easy to return to normal (Preferably from the edit tab in the toolbar).\r\n\r\nEDIT: It would also be appreciated as a debug option to see the invisible/hidden nodes ingame\r\n\r\nThis would be handy in so many situations as having to manually set nodes to visible to edit them is kinda annoying when working with invisible nodes.\r\n\r\nFor instance in a game I am working on, i use invisible tiles with an x texture to form walls, having to constantly set these visible and invisible to edit them and ensure they do not show up ingame is a pain!\r\n\r\nThere are many other examples that come to mind where this would be useful, plus it's a seemingly very small addition so there should be few conflicts with other

EG: In a build where stair tile NavPolygons did not include the leftmost and rightmost pixels (x of -8 or 8, leaving a 14 x 16 px NavPoly), function returned an empty path. Still happens with left/right and top/bottom bordered tiles, which use similar NavPolygons.\r\nMy project uses 16x16 map tiles and a 16x16 character. Shrinking the character sprites to below 14x14 did not solve the issue. \r\n\r\nPossibly related is this error, which appears in the log/terminal when the function fires:\r\n\"ERROR: Navigation2D::_navpoly_unlink: Condition ' !nm.linked ' is true.\r\nAt: scene\\2d\\navigation2d.cpp:147\"\r\n\r\n**Additional Information:**\r\nBoth the character sprites and tilemap are set to scale 2x2, though the issue still occurred at 1x1. Tiles also contain StaticBody2D and CollisionPolygon2D to prevent accidentally crossing over navigation boundaries and allow physics interactions. As get_simple_path produces some less-than-efficient paths when there are no obstacles, I'm using the RayCast to check for collisions to target and just setting the path to the target point if there aren't any. Oddly enough, since I'm creating the Nav and Collision polygons programmatically  in a tool script, they don't actually appear in the scene graph.)\r\n\r\n![tilescene-editor](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6465542/22630391/358697e8-ebae-11e6-9c28-8e0ef6c79252.jpg)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7731","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7731/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7731/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7731/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7731","id":205444197,"number":7731,"title":"possible workaround for #7730 - non-firing signal in AnimatedSprite","user":{"login":"seichter","id":579738,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/579738?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seichter","html_url":"https://github.com/seichter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seichter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seichter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seichter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seichter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seichter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seichter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seichter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seichter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seichter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false},{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-02-05T18:41:48Z","updated_at":"2017-06-25T09:21:16Z","closed_at":"2017-06-25T09:21:12Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/7731","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7731","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7731.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7731.patch"},"body":"This fixes #7730 - but it is not the cleanest way.

Just guessing ...\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\n\r\n[Minimal_AnimatedSprite.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/753050/Minimal_AnimatedSprite.zip)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/seichter/sandbox/tree/master/bugreports/godot-7730","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7729","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7729/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7729/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7729/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/7729","id":205416511,"number":7729,"title":"Excessive capturing of touch events in web export causes zoom lock","user":{"login":"eska014","id":6996191,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6996191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014","html_url":"https://github.com/eska014","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097455,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:html5","name":"platform:html5","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279098255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:porting","name":"topic:porting","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-02-05T10:36:48Z","updated_at":"2017-02-05T10:37:13Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Web export consumes most input events.\r\nFor touch events, this is problematic on mobile devices: If a player zooms in on the page before the game starts, they can no longer use pinch gestures on the canvas to zoom back out after game has started.
