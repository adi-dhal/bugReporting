Other undiscernable visual glitches also seem to be present here.\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\nVisible in texscreen demo (https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5310/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5309","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5309/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5309/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5309/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5309","id":161148237,"number":5309,"title":"Fix the joystick vibration on Linux","user":{"login":"nounoursheureux","id":6280095,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6280095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nounoursheureux","html_url":"https://github.com/nounoursheureux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nounoursheureux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nounoursheureux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nounoursheureux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nounoursheureux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nounoursheureux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nounoursheureux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nounoursheureux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nounoursheureux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nounoursheureux/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097326,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:linux","name":"platform:linux","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-06-20T09:02:53Z","updated_at":"2016-06-20T09:09:52Z","closed_at":"2016-06-20T09:09:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/5309","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5309","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5309.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5309.patch"},"body":"My previous pull request ( #5043 ) had two major bugs:\n- The timestamp for the _start_ and _stop_ commands were generated using different functions\n-  The effects were not removed from the joystick after being uploaded, so the vibration stopped working when the joystick's list of effects was full\n\nWhich made the joystick pretty much unusable, except for very basic tests (which is why I discovered these bugs only when I tried to _actually_ use the feature).

Double clicking with a keyboard button works fine, both clicks get registered as TRUE. Surprisingly, this issue just applies to the left mouse button, the right button works as expected.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nDownload the demo below. make a double click with the arrow-up button and hold the button down after 2nd press. you will notice that the player keeps jumping, so Input.is_action_pressed = TRUE.\nretry that with the left mouse button, with keeping the left mouse button pressed after the 2nd click of the double-click. you will notice that the player does not jumps while pressing down the button, so Input.is_action_pressed = FALSE.\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\nCheck this game at following commit as a demo:\nhttps://github.com/fry-/juck/tree/383ef70a2c4c5b15d6b8c76b242cb02bbe3bb475\nThe input logic is in player.gd, at line 30-40.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5299","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5299/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5299/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5299/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5299","id":161077817,"number":5299,"title":"Windows 10, godot compiled error.

find myself often editing a script, hit Ctrl+S to save it. But then, a few unexpected things happen:\n\n1) When I want to commit my work in Git I find that the last opened .tscn scene was modified. After reading diffs, it shows random line order changes, but technically the files are identical.\n\n2) So it means Godot saves the current scene when I use Ctrl+S, even when the scene is unmodified. If the scene is large, it might even slow down the process. I would expect not saving something that I didn't touched, or better, just save what I see (the script), not two files at a time.\n\nI remember there is a separate shortcut for saving scripts. Now we can edit shortcuts, but these two are still separate and have to be different...\nIMO it doesn't feels right. It should be possible to have a contextual save shortcut that saves only what there is on the focused panel (scene, script, shader...).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5289/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5288","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5288/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5288/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5288/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5288","id":161051946,"number":5288,"title":"Import issues (tested with audio sample)","user":{"login":"Zylann","id":1311555,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1311555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann","html_url":"https://github.com/Zylann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-06-19T01:43:34Z","updated_at":"2016-06-30T21:25:01Z","closed_at":"2016-06-30T21:25:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Tested on Windows 10 64 bits, commit bd79aa52ab2ef7eec4cad55d373b6e4fc7de7731\n\n1) I tried to import a WAV audio sample.
