Happens after a while (when using the spinbox?), the window will force mouse focus randomly and the mouse will disappear, tabbing out/between windows will eventually cause it.\r\n- this also appeared

This causes a weird effect because if a rigid body momentarely penetrate the shape near the joining edge the body is unrealistically pushed on one side of the edge.\r\n\r\n![edges_bug](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5478365/22527320/9ec5d7fe-e8c6-11e6-9061-b2e70dd9b39d.png)\r\n(Sorry my graphics tablet isn't working anymore, so I just used to mouse)\r\n\r\nAs you can see in image A the object hitting the flat plane made of two faces is pushed by the edge.\r\nIn image B I've drawn an edge and two faces. The edge is perpendicular to the screen. Now to understand that an edge has to be ignored we can look at the normals of the faces separated by the edge. If we compute the angle and this is greater or equal to 180 degrees then we ignore the edge.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n\r\nCreate a  static body with a planar collision shape made of two faces, on the plan xz and put a spherical rigid body on top of the egde slighty off one side.\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\n[edge_bug.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/746290/edge_bug.zip)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7700","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7700/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7700/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7700/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/7700","id":204698377,"number":7700,"title":"Expose collision resolution bias in editor for rigid bodies/collision shapes","user":{"login":"m4nu3lf","id":5478365,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5478365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4nu3lf","html_url":"https://github.com/m4nu3lf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4nu3lf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4nu3lf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4nu3lf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4nu3lf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4nu3lf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4nu3lf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4nu3lf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4nu3lf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4nu3lf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279097162,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/discussion","name":"discussion","color":"ee77ee","default":false},{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":370471880,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:physics","name":"topic:physics","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-02-01T20:39:08Z","updated_at":"2017-02-02T08:42:08Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It would be very useful to extend the PhysicsServer interface and rigid bodies to expose a custom bias for collision resolution and add a global property with the default bias factor for the project.
