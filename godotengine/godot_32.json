drag and drop support to the spatial editor with similar functionality to the canvas editor with cached previews too. The preview will also have a bounding box calculated which will allow dragged objects to intersect with other meshes for better alignment. Both the spatial and canvas editor also now use queue_free instead of direct memory freeing since this could cause crashes if a preview is dragged between multiple viewports very quickly.

I wanted to propose the border. but I don't know if it makes sense. It would be really easy to make it another option too.
