system or device - Godot version:**\r\nLinux -  5993a5f\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nWhen calling a function that takes a boolean parameter in VS, it defaults to `false` and can't be changed directly.

called on every script, while others like `_ready`, `_enter_tree` and `name_your_function` are called only on the first script where it is defined.\r\n\r\nThis makes not possible to do common things like initialize variables on secondary scripts when the node enters the tree, also not possible to make a single function call affecting all the scripts, reducing the usability of MultiScript.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to have everything called on every script, if I do `$Node.foo()`, have `ScriptA.foo()` and `ScriptB.foo()` executed.\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nAnd what if `foo()` returns a value? I have no idea...\r\n\r\nI wonder if will be needed some kind of keyword before `func` to control the way multi-methods are called (call all, just the first, override, and things like that).\r\n\r\nOr maybe a multi version of call, a `multi_call` that returns an array of results (but the problem with enter tree and ready persist).\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n - Make two scripts with _init, _ready, enter_tree,  _process and another function\r\n - Check the method calls, notice on which scripts are called each.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8546/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":1,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8545","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8545/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8545/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8545/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/8545","id":224439841,"number":8545,"title":"Allow exporting without packing","user":{"login":"Zephilinox","id":2060863,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2060863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zephilinox","html_url":"https://github.com/Zephilinox","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zephilinox/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zephilinox/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zephilinox/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zephilinox/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zephilinox/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zephilinox/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zephilinox/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zephilinox/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zephilinox/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279097162,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/discussion","name":"discussion","color":"ee77ee","default":false},{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":283518733,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"007700","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-04-26T11:47:06Z","updated_at":"2017-08-07T08:56:22Z","closed_at":"2017-08-07T00:21:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Right now there are 3 different export options that involve various ways of packing data.
