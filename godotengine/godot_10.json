happened, and what was expected. -->\r\nGodot doesn't recognize touch events when using Wacom Cintiq, meaning it prints out that the input event is left mouse button or mouse motion.  What makes it weirder is that godot also doesn't fire any event when I press the finger on the screen, I actually have to move it, only then the console prints that the left mouse button was pressed and motion event happened.\r\n\r\nSo the issue is that the touch event doesn't get recognized as touch event, instead it gets recognized as a left mouse button event, and also \"pressed\" and \"released\" states get printed out both only after finger was released from the screen, instead of printing \"pressed\" when finger was pressed and \"released\" when finger was released off the screen.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nJust to clarify it:\r\n1)I press on the screen -nothing happens\r\n2a)I release the finger off the screen - console prints that the left mouse button was pressed and released\r\n2b)I drag the finger - console prints that the left mouse button was pressed and mouse motion happened\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\n<!-- Optional but very welcome.

Godot version 2.1.4**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nUnwanted transparency\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nAccidentally imported tiles with around 95% alpha value from Inkscape. Noticed slight transparency immediately in the tilemap, observed that I could faintly see the furthest background objects though the tiles.\r\n\r\nI fixed the transparency issue and re-imported all the tiles. Still didn't fix anything in Godot, even though the transparency was gone in the actual tile assets. Made sure Opacity and Self Opacity of tilemap were set to 1. Tried nuking the tilemap and starting from scratch, duplicating the node, nothing worked. Tried using completely new tileset.res- this did work. However, any new tilesets built from the old tiles, even though they were fixed, did not work.\r\n\r\nFinally, just for kicks, I tried setting the Opacity and Self-Opacity to 1.1, which reverted back to 1.0 correctly in the editor, and rebuilt my game. It worked, and the transparency is no longer there.\r\n\r\nSo the issue appears to be the tiles themselves, or the tileset.res itself. Is it possible it retains some sort of metadata about transparency and hangs onto it?\r\n\r\nAlso unsure about why setting the opacity to over 1.0 fixed it.\r\n\r\nThis might not be reproducible, but figured I'd post it anyway in case someone else ran into it.\r\n\r\nCheers","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11583/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11582","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11582/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11582/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11582/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/11582","id":260386060,"number":11582,"title":"3D editor viewport turns black when editing a MeshInstance","user":{"login":"Calinou","id":180032,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/180032?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou","html_url":"https://github.com/Calinou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-09-25T19:19:01Z","updated_at":"2017-09-25T19:29:15Z","closed_at":"2017-09-25T19:29:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"**Operating system or device, Godot version, GPU Model and driver (if graphics related):** Windows 10, Godot Git https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/0a6446ff361f1674649e1625eb5868478d998091, NVIDIA\r\n\r\n**Issue description:** The main 3D editor viewport turns black when editing a MeshInstance (such as a CubeMesh).\r\n\r\n![Broken 3D viewport when editing a MeshInstance](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/180032/30826438-e870283a-a236-11e7-97e1-6e4c22298393.png)\r\n\r\nOnce this happens, this error is spammed in the console:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR: _gl_debug_print: GL ERROR: Source: OpenGL        Type: Error     ID: 1282        Severity: High  Message: GL_INVALID_OPERATION error generated.

logging logic was scattered over OS class implementations\r\nwith plenty of duplication.

It allows\r\n   easy configuration of logging mechanism depending on compile-time or\r\n   run-time configuration.\r\n\r\n - Implemented RotatedFileLogger which is usually used with StdLogger,\r\n   providing persistency of logs. It is often important to be able to\r\n   obtain logs of the game even in production to be able to understand\r\n   what happened prior to some problem. On mobile there previously was\r\n   no way to obtain the logs aside from having the device connected to\r\n   your machine.\r\n\r\n - flush() is not performed in release mode for every logged line. It\r\n   is only performed for errors.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11568/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11567","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11567/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11567/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11567/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/11567","id":260162716,"number":11567,"title":"Add types to scons command-line options","user":{"login":"QuLogic","id":302469,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/302469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuLogic","html_url":"https://github.com/QuLogic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuLogic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuLogic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuLogic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuLogic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuLogic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuLogic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuLogic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuLogic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuLogic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279098009,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:buildsystem","name":"topic:buildsystem","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-09-25T06:03:32Z","updated_at":"2017-09-25T20:45:37Z","closed_at":"2017-09-25T20:44:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/11567","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/11567","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/11567.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/11567.patch"},"body":"I keep calling `scons` with invalid variable values and it never complains.

worked on porting Particles System demo to Godot 3 as well as documenting the Particles-Particles2D node, I noticed a small but important issue. The explosiveness range in Godot 2 differs from Godot 3, it's inverted.\r\n\r\n- Min value in Godot 2 == Max value in Godot 3\r\n- Max value in Godot 2 == Min value in Godot 3\r\n\r\nThis could give any trouble when porting Godot 2 projects (which rely on Particles-Particles2D node) to Godot 3, because the behavior of the particles when played in Godot 2 will be different in Godot 3.\r\n\r\n- Godot 2, on Explosiveness : \r\nMin (0) --> Max (1) == Less Explosion --> More Explosion (I think, this is desired)\r\n- Godot 3, on Explosiveness : \r\nMin (0) --> Max (1) == More Explosion --> Less Explosion (I think, this is not desired)\r\n\r\nBy solving this issue, Godot users who port their Godot 2.x projects with Particles-Paricles2D node(s) inside will be having smoother transition and greater experience.
