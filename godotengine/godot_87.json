is in reaction to #9242, this only changes the default sizes of the primitive meshes to match the in world sizes of the collision shapes.\r\n\r\nI do agree with the observation in 9242 that the cube collision shape is double the size it should be. I have no opinion one way or the other if the capsule should be reorientated in the mesh or as a collision shape. However since we're still debating which way this will go I haven't changed anything here. \r\n\r\nI suggest not merging this PR until we have a final say as there is a good argument to change the cube and prism back to size (1.0, 1.0, 1.0).

I stumbled on an issue that requires me to return an array that holds all possible combinations of a sequence.\r\nI filed it as a question here:\r\nhttps://godotengine.org/qa/15813/function-that-returns-all-possible-combinations-sequence\r\n\r\n> Class1 = [1,2,3,4] Class2 = [1,2,3,4] Class3 = [1,2,3,4]\r\n> \r\n> Now what I would like to do is return all possible combinations of\r\n> these three classes.\r\n> \r\n> Example:\r\n> \r\n> 1 1 1\r\n> 2 1 1\r\n> 3 1 1\r\n> 4 1 1\r\n> 1 2 1\r\n> 2 2 1\r\n> 3 2 1\r\n> 4 2 1\r\n> ...\r\n\r\nThat functionality is available in python - as a module called itertools.\r\nTrying to write a function that does what I want in gdscript is proving to be dificult without the product itertools module.\r\n\r\nDoing that in python would be as simple as:\r\n```\r\nimport itertools\r\niterables = [ [1,2,3,4], [88,99], ['a','b'] ]\r\n\r\nfor t in itertools.product(*iterables):\r\n     print t\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat module would be incredibly useful when you want to automatically generate enemies with different types of armor for example - as it can create an array with all possible combinations of boots + helmets + chest for example \r\n\r\nIn my case, I am very close to writing a tool for godot that can aid artists and my tool needs that functionality. But I can see this being useful for games

_update_scroll() in various places so the editor lines are updated when the values change\r\n- Added variables and set/get functions for toggling the editor lines.\r\n\r\nI can remove or change anything if needed. I'm not sure on changing the transparency on the editor lines, but I liked being able to see if a camera was current or not at a glance.\r\n\r\nThere is one issue I couldn't figure out how to fix.

kinematicbody2d into a tilemap (which I assume uses a staticbody2d), the move will move you out of the collider too far, causing you to float a short distance (less than 0.05 units for shorter moves) outside of the collider, rather than moving directly onto its surface. This causes jitteryness when handling gravity and wall collisions, and can even cause things like accidental jump boosts when hugging walls, if working on a small scale (in this case, 512x512 window size running at 0.125x scale)\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nPlace a square with a staticbody2d and any collider with a flat surface (square works nicely).\r\nCreate a kinematicbody2d with a collider (square works nicely).\r\nPut into `_fixed_update()` code to run `move()` that causes it to run into the collider head-on.\r\nWatch it micro-jitter like hell.\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\n<!-- Optional but very welcome.
