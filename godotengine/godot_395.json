talked to Juan about this, and he seems to be in relative agreement that the slider on the treeview's numeric values isn't exactly an optimal solution. There are multiple things wrong with it, namely that there is no intelligent handling of limits that are essentially limitless (that is, -65536 to 65535), and it doesn't go away when you're done editing a field, which leads to accidental clicks that cause chaos. Example: I change the screen width of my project, and then for some reason try to use the mouse to go to the field below. Oops, the width of my project is now -12445.\n\nI'm not a C++ programmer, I'm more comfortable in C#. And I don't know the codebase well enough to create proper fixes, but I don't feel the slider contributes anything of value to this particular gui element, so for now, I've just gotten rid of it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/17/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/16","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/16/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/16/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/16/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/16","id":27298373,"number":16,"title":"Build

main reason for doing this is to provide more reliable hosting, and out-of-box support for GFM.\n\nAlternatively, moving this stuff into the source directory itself as Markdown would make it easier to review community documentation updates.\n\nEither way would be an improvement, I'm finding that the godotengine.org wiki is frequently either very slow to respond, or just times

By default this setting is off, and such default behaviour is exactly the same as before these changes.\n\nWhen on, the camera will follow it's global rotation, so that one can change its orientation if desired.\nIn some cases rotating the camera makes not much sense, for example when it is a child of a movable character in a side-scrolling platform game - it should follow that character, but never rotate, so that game's top is always camera's top.\n\nHowever, there is a number of cases when we would like to rotate the view.\n- Any kind of 2D top-down games, where the player sees the surroundings from above, like a flat map - in such case the camera should follow character's orientation, so that screen's top is the character's front. For example, top-down driving/racing game's controls are much less confusing when if the camera rotates [to enable view from vehicle's perspective one might simply reparent the camera to the vehicle node, and enable Centered and Rotating properties.].\n- Some animations/effect may include a wiggling camera.\n- Games with perspective changes, (where e.g. one can change gravity orientation) may want to rotate the camera instead of rotating the whole world, as this approach is simpler and probably more efficient.\n\nThe way I have implemented this feature makes it fully compatible with other camera properties, including Camera2D.Centered, Camera2D.Zoom, Camera2D.Offset, drag margin, etc.\n\nIt does not break existing scenes, as it is an optional feature that is turned off by default.\n\nI have tested it in a number of different use cases [following cam, dragged cam, static camera, multiple cameras and animated camera movement], with desired results, but if you notice anything wrong, I will be happy to fix it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/10","id":27261079,"number":10,"title":"stretch_2d
