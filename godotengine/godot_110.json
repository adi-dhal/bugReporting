Connecting points and giving most points a weight of 1, and some points a weight of 2. Expected solution would be to consider moving through 2-weighted cells to cost 2 move points and 1-weighted cells to cost 1 point.  Looks like weight gets multiplied to the whole distance calculation (*= used in line 194 or 222, etc). I saw it avoiding a path of 8 2-weighted cells and choosing instead 22 1-weighted cells.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nCreate a hex tile map and add only the hexes that have a tile on them as points in A-Star. connect all adjacent hexes. Give some cells a weight of 2 and some a weight of one, making some paths theoretically cost more. When path is solved, the shortest path often doesn't seem to properly factor cost as per cell, but cumulative instead. Pretty hard to explain, but it seems wrong to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\nI'll make a sample project and add it soon...it'll take a little extra time.
