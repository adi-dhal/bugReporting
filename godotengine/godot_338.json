If I have a commonly used node (such as the player sprite) and I decide later that I want it to disappear (when dying for example), I now need to scour my code for instances of it to make sure my game won't crash.\n\nRight now, this means wrapping each instance of `get_node()` (or similar) with:\n\n``` gdscript\nvar node = get_node(\"node\")\nif node != null:\n  # do something with node\n```\n\n**What I am proposing** is a simplified syntax:\n\n``` python\nwith get_node(\"node\") as node:\n  # do something with node\n```\n\n`with` would run the statement (`get_node` in this case), then if the result isn't `null`, assign it to the variable after `as`, and run the code block.\n\nOn the surface, this is just a small bit of syntactic sugar, but it also opens up some possibilities.\n\nThe first is automatic debugging facilities. While you may generally want to be able to gracefully delete a node using this pattern, it could also lead to unexpected behavior if overused. As such, a warning could be automatically printed to the console in the case of a null result:\n\n```\n[Notice]: Null result in 'with' statement in [NodePath] line [#], col [#]. This may result in unexpected behavior.\n```\n\nOf course, this might actually be expected behavior, in which case it would be nice to handle it intentionally.\n\n``` python\nwith get_node(\"node\") as node:\n  # do something\nwithout: # or perhaps 'else'\n  # do something else\n```\n\nIn a sense this would create a case-specific try/except block.\n\nOf course, `with` is a common keyword in other languages, and its usage varies between them, so perhaps another keyword might be preferred (sadly, `using` has the same problem). Or perhaps we could expand it to share [behavior](http://effbot.org/zone/python-with-statement.htm) with the language that (sorta) gave me this idea, and GDScripts main influence, Python, by having it use _optionally_ support construction and deconstruction callbacks (`_with_enter`/`_with_exit`?) if the statement results in an object. Of course, Python's primary use for those, file handling, may be unnecessary in GDScript.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1735","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1735/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1735/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1735/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/1735","id":70910240,"number":1735,"title":"Array shuffle and reflect function","user":{"login":"GlaDOSik","id":3484686,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3484686?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GlaDOSik","html_url":"https://github.com/GlaDOSik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GlaDOSik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GlaDOSik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GlaDOSik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GlaDOSik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GlaDOSik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GlaDOSik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GlaDOSik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GlaDOSik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GlaDOSik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false},{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-04-25T13:26:37Z","updated_at":"2015-11-05T09:37:22Z","closed_at":"2015-11-05T09:37:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Vector Operator node in visual shader editor doesn't have reflect function.\n\nBuilt-in shuffle function for array would be useful.

Navigation2D, I've encountered a situation when the start point (the player position) crosses over one of the path nodes.  The next path calculated still contains this node, despite it being unnecessary.  It's not technically an invalid path, as it still eventually leads to the goal, but moving in the direction of that node puts the player back on the other side of that node, so the next calculated path naturally includes that node again.  The end result is that the player oscillates around that path node forever.  I know this is a side effect of the way I'm using the path result, since the path provided isn't actually _wrong_.
