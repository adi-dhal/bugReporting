PR does the following:\r\n\r\n- Add two new functions on core/typedefs.h: previous_power_of_2 and closest_power_of_2.\r\n- Rename nearest_power_of_2 to next_power_of_2.\r\n- Implement mix_rate and latency settings on the OS X audio driver.\r\n- Change samples_in from int32_t * to Vector<int32_t> for easier resizing of the array, on the OS X audio driver.\r\n- Clean a bit the OS X audio driver code and add a missing kAudioUnitProperty_SetRenderCallback on the AudioDriverOSX::finish function to clear the callback.\r\n- Use the new closest_power_of_2 function when calculating the buffer_size on the audio drivers.\r\n\r\nNote/explanation: I've changed the name of nearest_power_of_2 to next_power_of_2 since it will always get the next power of 2. I found this out while implementing the latency setting on the OS X audio driver, the most common math for the buffer_size is: 25 * 44100 / 1000 (latency * mix_rate / 1000), which gives 1102, when calling nearest_power_of_2 it returned 2048 which is the next power of 2 (instead of 1024 which I was expecting), so that's why I added closest_power_of_2 which returns 1024 when called with 1102.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10406/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10405","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10405/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10405/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10405/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/10405","id":251081277,"number":10405,"title":"Opening a 3D scene tab containing 2D elements switches to 2D regardless of selection","user":{"login":"Zylann","id":1311555,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1311555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann","html_url":"https://github.com/Zylann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":283518733,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"007700","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-08-17T21:44:19Z","updated_at":"2017-09-04T21:01:06Z","closed_at":"2017-09-04T21:01:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Godot 3.0 alpha1\r\nWindows 10 64 bits\r\n\r\nI have a 3D scene that contains spatial nodes, but also contains some 2D ones.
