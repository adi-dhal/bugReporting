system or device:**\nWin10 64 bit; 24 Gigs RAM; third-gen i7 CPU; ATI HD 7xxx GPU.\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nWhen changing the normal map data in a shader material (using the visual node editor). The edited data will initially show like it should in the viewport. However, when you save the material, the visuals you get in the viewport will revert back to how it looked when the editing was started (but the new data _is_ saved). The only way to really update it for good is to then exit to the projects window and reload the project in question.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nDownload the project file, go to its shader node setup, play around with the normal map data a little, then save the material. Instant revert in the viewport (visually at least). Exit to the projects window and re-open the project to see it updated like it should be.\n\n**Link to minimal example project** **(optional but very welcome):**\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/download/3mucchbbonshdbz/Terrain%282%29.zip\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4443/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4442","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4442/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4442/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4442/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4442","id":150976636,"number":4442,"title":"Node Multi-Edit can't attach script to multiple nodes","user":{"login":"n-pigeon","id":6152134,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6152134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-pigeon","html_url":"https://github.com/n-pigeon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-pigeon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-pigeon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-pigeon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-pigeon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-pigeon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-pigeon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-pigeon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-pigeon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-pigeon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279128044,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/confirmed","name":"confirmed","color":"66dd66","default":false},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":283518733,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"007700","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-04-25T20:47:17Z","updated_at":"2016-06-19T13:22:00Z","closed_at":"2016-06-19T13:13:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nI've tried to add same script to multiple nodes using multi-edit feature and properties editor.

There is a feature called filters. If you don't know, you can't avoid using it if you blend\n   several animations or using oneshot node for things like blinking, as it limits scope of your animations.\n   We need to have separate filters \"node\" from blend/oneshot nodes in GUI.\n   This node will allow us eventually implement general animation filtering, which will make\n   animation composition hardships go away. Basically all important functionality\n   is already implemented, this is small readjustment.\n   Nedd to mention we don't want to attach this \"node\" to Animation node.\n2. Animation node needs to have multiple output in GUI. This\n   can be generated into multiple animation \"nodes\" for each output, or some other things,\n   but this have to be done, as lots of nodes with the same animation really clutters scene output.\n\nImagine you have \"blink\" animation and \"breathe\" animation.\nFirst one goes to oneshot node, second is looped, they blend to all animations like, walk, stand.\nsit, lay down, idle13, whatever. If you have hundred main animations ,only these 2 detail animations will\nmake your setup into 300 nodes hard to navigate and manage.\nInternally this can be the same as now, but for GUI something needs to change.\n1.  The filter editor for animations with many tracks (like skeletal animations) looks like mess.\n   It is very hard to navigate. Probably it should be replaced by something useful, but probably\n   if possible the existing one can be improved by a few simple things:\n   - Add search for simple substring with immediate display (like quick search in some apps)\n     not requiring press Enter after each result, just reducing output with additional character entered.\n2. Add \"invert selection\", \"select all\", \"unselect all\" buttons\n3. Disable treeish view (probably a checkbox with immediate reaction), replacing it with plain table), that would really help with bones,\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4438/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4437","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4437/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4437/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4437/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4437","id":150798864,"number":4437,"title":"Movable collision object for collision avoidance","user":{"login":"slapin","id":6099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin","html_url":"https://github.com/slapin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-04-25T09:20:38Z","updated_at":"2016-04-25T09:44:18Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We all seen that Godot lacks collision bodies which could be controlled by bones.\nSo it should have feature of static body (not movable on its own), but\nstill collide and prevent collisions from occurring (collision avoidance).\n\nWhile we can sorta implement this for triggering (i.e. hit boxes ,etc.)\nusing Area but that will not solve a problem of collision avoidance.\n\nAlso we can manipulate positions of collision bodies within RigidBody from code.\n\nThis is more actual when  using bones, as other cases can be handled by adding many collision shapes.

Newer builds (done in the last week) now show the shader script editor (regardless of whether I want to do any editing or not).\n\nThen, returning to the shader does not close the script window, so now you have two additional windows instead of just one. I can see the use of having the raw code made available, but whether or not the script window is visible should be a user option rather than something done automatically by Godot (unless of course you're in the regular custom shader options and you explicitly use the script field in the _reference_ area).\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nOpen the file, select the mesh instance, go to the material editing buttons via the material override menu, go to the shader tree editing via the shader menu, then back out of the tree editing with the back button.\n\n**Edit:: Example file to try it

using script files to generate some scenes of my projects. It works fine with your text format, except when it comes to asset management. Unless I've missed it, I haven't been able to find documentation about the file format for `tex`, `atex`, `fnt` and similar binary formats, which makes them quite hard to correctly generate. Looking at the issues and the source code, I've been able to find references to a `tres` format, but I'm not sure if it's what I'm looking for, since it doesn't seem to be used for textures and fonts in the example files.\n\nBasically, I'd like to be able to write a file with the following:\n\n```\n[texture]\nimage_path = /assets/directory/myImage.png\nimage_data = 45A45D21B454BADDCFFDE88==\n```\n\nIs that possible, one way or the other?\n\nI'm aware that it would increase the project size and loading time, and that not every resource needs to be imported first (but some are, such as fonts, so why not do it for everything since a script will do it anyway), but I'd still like to know if it's possible. Being able to dynamically generate resources pre-build would be a tremendous help.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4419","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4419/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4419/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4419/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4419","id":150639517,"number":4419,"title":"mention collision layers and masks in Documentation","user":{"login":"Marqin","id":959429,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/959429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marqin","html_url":"https://github.com/Marqin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marqin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marqin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marqin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marqin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marqin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marqin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marqin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marqin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marqin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false},{"id":283518839,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"ffbbff","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-04-24T08:17:14Z","updated_at":"2016-04-24T12:17:26Z","closed_at":"2016-04-24T12:17:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Collision Layers & Masks are not even mentioned in Godot Docs.

Other, continuous tracks all get set correctly, resulting in chaotic / incorrect display of the animation.\n- The only way to see animation correctly is to manually drag / rewind animation to `0.0s`, and then drag the time slider over to `2.5s`. This is a huge time killer, and makes editing very cumbersome.\n\nIn my case, character body parts are separate, and have different frames for \"straight\", \"bent at elbow\", \"holding a gun\" etc., so sprite frame number, and sprite offset are set to discrete. I've wasting a ton of time needlessly scrubbing the animation back to last frame, just so I can see it displayed correctly.\n\nMy game also saves character state, along with current animation name, and current animation time. When game is restored, the animation is often somewhere in progress, and what I see is mangled / incorrectly positioned body parts at wrong frames.\n![screen-shot-2016-04-23-at-7 33 12-pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6539713/14764781/b430dd1c-098a-11e6-9947-3815e35fe013.jpg)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4745","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"E107:572C:151C82B:29EBA5E:59D69DA1","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=249>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=247>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"978c688c381ddf2aaf34ed1dcca4481e\"","status":"200 OK"}}
