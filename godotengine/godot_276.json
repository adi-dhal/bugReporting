wanting to give it a try, here is the Pygments documentation about writing lexers: http://pygments.org/docs/lexerdevelopment/\nThe existing \"python3\" lexer could likely be taken as a base and enhanced (though it is likely far more advanced than what GDScript actually needs).\n\nOnce done, we would try to use it to generate our own doc, and also get it merged upstream in a future Pygments

This can be configured in the Project Settings (see previous tutorials)\n\nI see two issues with this, first, tutorials should attempt to be as self-contained as possible. It would a small addition to the tutorial to add a line and an image showing how to modify the resolution of the game, even if it has been previously covered. However, the more egregious issue is that this line actively deceives the reader, if you follow the tutorials as they are currently setup on the website none of the previous tutorials have shown how to modify the resolution of the game. Once more, this is why tutorials ought to attempt to remain self-contained and reduce external references where possible. External references, and especially assumptions like, that greatly reduce the ability of the documentation to avoid logical issues when the documentation is modified over time.\n\nIn particular, each tutorial or piece of documentation has an intended audience, this particular piece of documentation is intended for very new beginners, and two very important steps are easy to either miss or be miss led by.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3600/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3599","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3599/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3599/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3599/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3599","id":131738869,"number":3599,"title":"Added

working in the inspector it would be very convenient to be able to move between a series of input fields using the tab key. In the below image the Left Margin input field is currently selected, it would be a massive improvement in usability if you were able to hit tab to move to the next input field. Right now you have to either click between the different fields, yet, because of the slider that is often present you can't even conveniently click into the next field, meaning instead you have to hit enter then click the next input field, or you can choose to use the arrow keys and enter to move into the next field, both of which are far less convenient then a simple hit of the tab

is a feature request.\n\nRecently added feature of inheriting scene is very helpful, allowing us to derive slightly different scenes based on existing ones. It complements GDScript's extends mechanism to build on from existing code base. However, it doesn't look like these two features play well together yet.\n\nHere's which I believe a typical scenario: I have a base character scene, with a root node KinematicBody and a script attached to it. Now, I can use \"New Inherited Scene\" and start adding new features (meaning, adding new nodes, which apparently I can) and so on, but this also means I need to add new behavior in the attached script. Unfortunately, the inherited scene and the base scene share the same script file, and it seems Godot doesn't (yet?) allow me to use a different script file for the root node of the inherited scene.\n\nIf it did, I could have simply use extends and build upon the base script. I think this is a necessary feature in order to have true inheritance.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3591/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3590","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3590/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3590/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3590/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/3590","id":131548018,"number":3590,"title":"Viewport mouse position only updated after touch release, not touch press.","user":{"login":"mpatraw","id":7443396,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7443396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpatraw","html_url":"https://github.com/mpatraw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpatraw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpatraw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpatraw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpatraw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpatraw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpatraw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpatraw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpatraw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpatraw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false},{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279097562,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:android","name":"platform:android","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279097519,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:ios","name":"platform:ios","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279098255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:porting","name":"topic:porting","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-02-05T03:57:15Z","updated_at":"2016-03-24T13:06:07Z","closed_at":"2016-03-24T13:06:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Here is the example I'm using: https://www.dropbox.com/s/bngu083qctasmal/example.tar.gz?dl=0\n\nWhen a mouse button is pressed _**and held**_ on desktop the viewport.get_mouse_pos() function returns the correct position.

Support exporting of arrays with a given export hint, as in `export([], String, FILE)`\n\n---\n\nIt would be nice if one can export an array of some export type, like an array of enums, an array of filepaths, etc. So, in other words, support not only:\n\n``` gdscript\nexport(String, FILE) var file\nexport(NodePath) var nodepath\n```\n\nbut also:\n\n``` gdscript\nexport([], String, FILE) var files\nexport([], NodePath) var nodepaths\n```\n\nor even:\n\n``` gdscript\nexport([], [], String, FILE) var files_2d_array\nexport([], [], NodePath) var nodepaths_2d_array\n```\n\n---\n\nBecause syntax needs some discussion, I would go on and propose a few variants:\n- 1a. Square brackets (`[` and `]`) before other export parameters\n\n``` gdscript\nexport([], String, FILE) var files\nexport([], [], float) var heights\nexport([], Array) var anything_array_2d\nexport([], []) var anything_array_2d # Or maybe not?\n```\n- 1b. Array before other export parameters\n\n``` gdscript\nexport(Array, String, FILE) var files\nexport(Array, Array, float) var heights\nexport(Array, Array) var anything_array_2d\n```\n- 2a. Brackets after export parameters\n\n``` gdscript\nexport(String, FILE)[] var files\nexport(float)[][] var heights\nexport[][] var anything_array_2d\n```\n- 2b. Brackets after export parameters, alteranative multi-dimetional\n\n``` gdscript\nexport(float)[,] var heights\nexport[,] var anything_array_2d\n```\n- 3a. Brackets before export parameters\n\n``` gdscript\nexport[](String, FILE) var files\nexport[][](float) var heights\nexport[][] var anything_array_2d # Same as 2a\n```\n- 3b. Brackets before export parameters, alteranative multi-dimetional\n\n``` gdscript\nexport[,](float) var heights\nexport[,] var anything_array_2d # Same as 2b\n```\n- 4a. Plural inflections on params, disallowing multi-dimensional exports\n\n``` gdscript\nexport(String, FILE)s var files\nexport(Array)s var anything_array_2d\n# Can't export typed multidimenstional arrays, such as float[][]\n```\n- 4b. Plural inflections on keyword, disallowing multi-dimensional exports\n\n``` gdscript\nexports(String, FILE) var files\nexports(Array) var anything_array_2d\n# Can't export typed multidimenstional arrays, such as float[][]\n```\n\nAs for my own preference, I like `1b` and `3a` the most, because I think they would match the current style. But `1a` isn't too bad either. I wouldn't go with any of `2b`, `3b`, `4a` or `4b`, as they don't match the style well enough.\n\n---\n\nP.S. I'm not looking for workarounds, and I know that they exist for `NodePaths` or 2D arrays. Also, some things like exported enums or file paths can't be really worked around without editor plugins for the moment.\n\nP.P.S. There was a similar issue earlier #3388, but it wasn't as general as this one, and it got closed as it was asking for some way to assign resources (not any export type) in arrays.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3586/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3585","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3585/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3585/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3585/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3585","id":131398845,"number":3585,"title":"support horizontal mouse wheel","user":{"login":"Hinsbart","id":8281916,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/8281916?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart","html_url":"https://github.com/Hinsbart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-02-04T16:22:51Z","updated_at":"2017-02-21T16:11:08Z","closed_at":"2016-02-04T18:06:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/3585","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3585","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3585.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3585.patch"},"body":"fixes #3565.

the console is created it proceeds to spawn the Godot Project Manager, however, I like having my   taskbar at the top of my monitor, and when the Project Manager window is created it is positioned under the taskbar, which normally wouldn't be that big of an issue, but the location isn't remembered from run to run meaning it always appears in the same location. The real issue is that the windows header frame is completely under the task bar meaning that I have to always shift-click, select move, hit an arrow key, reposition. Technically, I don't need to move the window since nothing within the client I need to click is obscured, but to me its an annoying visual bug. The ideal fix would be to have the project manager remember its position between runs (and while your at it perhaps do the same for the editor).\n\nThank you for your time, and all your hard work on Godot, I really think Godot's got something special about it.\n\n![godotcreatedunderwindows](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17059062/12806169/82d8975c-cad1-11e5-8b8c-cbc8c4a3c35d.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3578/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3577","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3577/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3577/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3577/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/3577","id":131225177,"number":3577,"title":"Event streams errors with XM modules.","user":{"login":"freemanfromgodotengine","id":11817561,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/11817561?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/freemanfromgodotengine","html_url":"https://github.com/freemanfromgodotengine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freemanfromgodotengine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freemanfromgodotengine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freemanfromgodotengine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freemanfromgodotengine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freemanfromgodotengine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freemanfromgodotengine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freemanfromgodotengine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freemanfromgodotengine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freemanfromgodotengine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279128044,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/confirmed","name":"confirmed","color":"66dd66","default":false},{"id":410064485,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/needs%20testing","name":"needs testing","color":"ff9900","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-02-04T03:03:23Z","updated_at":"2017-03-10T14:58:38Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"When trying to import xm module I get:\n\n```\n> ERROR: set_volume_fadeout: Condition ' p_amount>MAX_FADEOUT ' is true.\n>    At: drivers/chibi/cp_instrument.cpp:133.\n> ERROR: set_volume_fadeout: Condition ' p_amount>MAX_FADEOUT ' is true.\n>    At: drivers/chibi/cp_instrument.cpp:133.\n> ERROR: set_volume_fadeout: Condition ' p_amount>MAX_FADEOUT ' is true.\n>    At: drivers/chibi/cp_instrument.cpp:133.\n> ERROR: set_volume_fadeout: Condition ' p_amount>MAX_FADEOUT ' is true.\n>    At: drivers/chibi/cp_instrument.cpp:133.\n> ERROR: get_instrument: Index p_instrument out of size (MAX_INSTRUMENTS).\n>    At: drivers/chibi/cp_song.cpp:349.\n```\n\nTesting XM module was created in MilkyTracker.\n4 voices used with 4 instruments (one each), 1 sample in each instrument. Samples are stereo 16-bit 44100 wave files, approx. 30 sec long, imported with mixing channels option.\nAll 4 instruments are playing together, only one, long note at the beginning of the song first and only pattern. All of that is a 10Mb xm file.\n\nAt first few times Godot were just quitting after this errors.\nAfter manipulating with playback mode in MilkyTracker, Godot was able to import the xm file and play it. The errors in console are still there.\n\nMay be related to https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2553\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4717","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"E44F:572C:15207EC:29F3C94:59D69E13","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=277>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=275>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"f6617aafb10cbcbc3e166851abc7784a\"","status":"200 OK"}}
