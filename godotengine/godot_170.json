in the middle of the development of a game and I'd like to know how the Godot 3.0 project is going to be managed.\n\nWhat I know/believe;\n- a) Godot 2.2 is going to be skipped in favor of Godot 3.0.\n- b) Godot 3.0 will be based on OpenGL ES 3.\n- c) Godot 3.0 will break compatibility with 2.x at various levels (scripting, shaders, etc.).\n\nGodot current master branch currently features pretty much everything I need, but during the lifetime of my project I will probably need to update some things (support for upcoming Android/iOS releases, engine bugfixes, etc.).\n\nI can deal with adapting my project to 3.0 as long as no very complex changes are needed at the scene and script levels, but rewriting shaders and specially loosing compatibility with OpenGL 2 are big concerns for me.\n\nAre these my only options?:\n- Keep using 2.1 custom builds and hope no engine or platform support updates are needed.\n- Switch to 3.0, readapt, rewrite shaders, etc. and loose support for OpenGL ES 2.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6785/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6784","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6784/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6784/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6784/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6784","id":182153335,"number":6784,"title":"Crash

#6768.\n\nAlso tries to be more user-friendly: in case the original node name ended in `separator + 0` (explicit user intent of zero-based counting) the first attempt at a non-colliding name will be `separator + 1`.\n\nIf the original name has no a `separator + n` trailer, the next attempt will be `separator + 2`, like the classic behavior.\n\nI take the opportunity to ask here:\nIf the setting for separator was set to none and a node name naturally ended with a number (either a node type or a character name like `R2D2`), the algorithm would do a unnatural serial naming: `R2D3`, `R2D4`, etc. That was the case even before my modifications IIRC. Then the question is: should the setting for no separator be dropped to avoid such scenarios or instead should we let the user understand what is happening (that Godot has not AI for disambiguating)?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6777/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6776","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6776/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6776/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6776/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/6776","id":181981334,"number":6776,"title":"Allow step for integer properties","user":{"login":"RandomShaper","id":11797174,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11797174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper","html_url":"https://github.com/RandomShaper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":283518733,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"007700","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-10-10T10:25:42Z","updated_at":"2016-10-11T07:10:00Z","closed_at":"2016-10-11T07:10:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/6776","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/6776","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/6776.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/6776.patch"},"body":"If step is not provided in the hint string, it defaults to 1 so if doesn't affect existent properties.\n\nI don't know why this is not already enabled.
