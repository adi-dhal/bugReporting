Reduz,\n\nI am at a Ubuntu 64 machine and wanted to edit a script from a demo, but as soon as I click on the script button and the view changes to the script view, ubuntus crash handler pops up and tells me that he received a sigarbt.. The editor is still visible but there is no content in it.\nAfter that I tried to create a new project but as soon as I want to create a script the same thing happens.\n\nTried it with a completely fresh compile just a moment ago and with the official release - both are non working here.\n\nI tried godot a few weeks after it was open sourced - back then there was no problem to change the view to the script view...\n\nGreetings,
