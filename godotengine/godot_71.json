This is a significant problem when developing on Windows, because your build script cannot override the loaded DLL, so you have to close the editor and open it again which is a considerable waste of time.\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour is that the DLL is only loaded if it's a part of editor plugin, not when it is a part of the application being developed.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n1. Build a GDNative library (e.g. using [C++ bindings](https://github.com/GodotNativeTools/cpp_bindings)) and ensure you have the DLL specified in the library's .tres file as a part of your project.\r\n2. Open the project in the editor.\r\n3. Try to delete or replace the DLL. You will get access errors.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9746","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9746/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9746/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9746/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9746","id":244602842,"number":9746,"title":"Label: add auto_height","user":{"login":"Noshyaar","id":26753932,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/26753932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar","html_url":"https://github.com/Noshyaar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":7,"created_at":"2017-07-21T08:43:28Z","updated_at":"2017-07-24T21:05:27Z","closed_at":"2017-07-24T21:05:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/9746","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9746","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9746.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9746.patch"},"body":"Fixes #7679 if merged.\r\n\r\nI've seen #4379 and I'm not sure why width-based height would not work.

The workflow is a bit convoluted, especially because it is geared towards people with lesser programming experience.\r\n\r\nFor those who don't know, adding a custom node to a visual script requires these steps:\r\n\r\n- Add a `Custom Node` to the VS, from the `Custom` category.\r\n- Select (in the Inspector) the right script with the custom node code.\r\n- ~Close and reopen the VS, because it does not reload.~ (fixed by #9741)\r\n- Use the new node.\r\n\r\nThis is how I think custom nodes should be added:\r\n\r\n- Find the wanted custom node in the `Available Nodes` panel.\r\n- Drop it into place and use it.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion to make this work is quite simple: add some `EditorPlugin` function that adds a custom node to the VS editor. Then it'll just be a matter of calling `add_custom_vs_node(name, category, script)` from a plugin to be able to use it in the scripts.\r\n\r\nThe VS editor would just automate the process that is currently done manually.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9735/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9734","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9734/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9734/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9734/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9734","id":244362530,"number":9734,"title":"Fix Android export","user":{"login":"endragor","id":2417849,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2417849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/endragor","html_url":"https://github.com/endragor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/endragor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/endragor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/endragor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/endragor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/endragor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/endragor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/endragor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/endragor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/endragor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-07-20T13:28:15Z","updated_at":"2017-07-22T11:33:59Z","closed_at":"2017-07-20T16:28:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/9734","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9734","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9734.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9734.patch"},"body":"Added texture format choice to export settings.

top of. It works as expected if you are standing underneath the platform and jump. but, if you are touching a wall at the same time the character gets stuck in the platform and is_on_floor return true. \r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nI incuded a test scene. Just run to the right wall, and jump (up arrow) while still running towards the wall so it receives the wall collision too. \r\n\r\n[collision_bug2.tar.gz](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/1161828/collision_bug2.tar.gz)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9729/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4922","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"ACFB:572B:CF220E:1B5BCAF:59D69AC0","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=72>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=70>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"50f674fa07cf4420e08747330ff71ff1\"","status":"200 OK"}}
