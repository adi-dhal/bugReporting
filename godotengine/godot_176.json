Anyway, naming conventions, this is what I have:\n- member variables (properties & such): only nouns\n- methods: verb (present tense), verb + nous, just like the usual: `get_position` for example & the verb should go first always\n- signals: verb (that describes state) / verb + nouns, for example instead of `enter_tree` have `entering_tree` (if it's fired before doing the action) and `entered_tree` if triggers after the task has finished (it has already entered), just like the methods, it should go first. For examples `script_changed` would become `changed_script`.\n\nAlso I think GDScript should only offer one of two options or both, but be complete:\n- either access a member variable (or property) directly and change it, for example `transoform.origin.x = some_new_value`\n- or only through `set_`, `get_` methods, like `set_pos()`, `get_pos()`\n\nBy complete I mean have all properties be directly accessible and settable through the first option and have them accessible through `set_`, `get_`.

You can match on the contents of an array for example.\n\n``` GDScript\nvar array = [13, \"37\", [\"test\", \"array\"]]\nmatch array:\n    [13, \"37\", [\"test\", \"array\"]]: print(\"Wow, a perfect match!\")\n    [13, 37, ..]:                  print(\"l33t man\") # .. matches the rest of the array\n    []:                            print(\"empty array\")\n```\n\n~~Matching on a dictionary would work the same, except that matching on keys wouldn't be possible.~~\nDictionaries would be matched on the key **and** the value. \n## Deconstructing values\n\nInstead of simply branching depending on the equality of values it would be possible to bind new variables.\n\nWhen the first pattern that matches the value is encountered the corresponding branch will be executed. If a pattern doesn't match the next one is tried. So the *more general patterns should be defined beneath the more specific.\n\nTo bind a new variable you would simply write a new identifier instead of a value.\n\n``` GDScript\nvar array = [13, \"37\", [\"test\", \"array\"]]\nmatch array:\n    [13, \"37\", [var a, var b]]: print(a, \", \", b) # a = \"test\", b = \"array\"\n    var n:                      print(\"Unknown array structure: \" + str(n))\n```\n\nWhen matching dictionaries only the value would be bindable. e.g. `{\"test\": var a}`\n\nJust matching on a new identifier is equal to the `default` case in `switch`-statements.\n\n**_Let me know what you think**_ :blush:

system or device - Godot version:**\n\nGodot 2.1 official / custom build from GIT; Windows 7; old Intel graphics which supports OpenGL 2.1:\n\n```\nMobile Intel(R) 4 Series Express Chipset Family from Intel\nOpenGL version 2.1.0 - Build 8.15.10.2869 is supported\n```\n\nIt doesn't work also on VirtualBox drivers.\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\n- Current behavior: Godot crashes at startup without any useful information.\n- Expected behavior: Godot runs on this platform, because it can run there. Otherwise show information about incompatible OpenGL driver and close without crash.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n\nRun Godot and expect crash on OpenGL 2.1 on Windows.\n\n**Additional information:**\n\nOn Linux and Mesa OpenGL 2.1 drivers - Godot works properly (on the same hardware), because Mesa is new and Mesa is cheating :)\n\nAs far I found 11 function which are compatible with GLES 2.0 and OpenGL 3.0 (not OpenGL 2.1):\n- `glGenFramebuffers`,\n- `glGenerateMipmap`,\n- `glGenRenderbuffers`,\n- `glBindRenderbuffer`,\n- `glBindFramebuffer`,\n- `glCheckFramebufferStatus`,\n- `glDeleteRenderbuffers`,\n- `glDeleteFramebuffers`,\n- `glFramebufferTexture2D`,\n- `glRenderbufferStorage`,\n- `glFramebufferRenderbuffer`.\n\nEvery function listed above are supported with \"EXT\" suffix (e.g. `glGenerateMipmapEXT`). Replacing it in `rasterizer_gles2.cpp` allows Godot to run and play/edit 2D game on old Intel driver (VirtualBox shows white window and GLSL link error in console, but doesn't crash).\n\nGodot should use functions with `EXT` suffix for OpenGL < 3.0 and it should check every pointer on initialization (instead of checking the OpenGL version).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6591/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6590","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6590/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6590/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6590/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6590","id":178851647,"number":6590,"title":"Android modules are unusable","user":{"login":"WalasPrime","id":11784263,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11784263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalasPrime","html_url":"https://github.com/WalasPrime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalasPrime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalasPrime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalasPrime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalasPrime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalasPrime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalasPrime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalasPrime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalasPrime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalasPrime/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false},{"id":279097562,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:android","name":"platform:android","color":"dddddd","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-09-23T11:21:01Z","updated_at":"2017-01-25T09:49:58Z","closed_at":"2017-01-25T09:49:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Windows 10, current master\n\nI've tried to test an Ad module for Godot, but I've ran into issues where the app crashes (on a physical device).

the top image, there are thicker blur parts.\n\nIn the bottom image, there are thinner blur parts characteristic of a lightweight FXAA implementation.\n\nThe top image is obviously incorrect and
