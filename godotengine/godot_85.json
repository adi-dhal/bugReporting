capturing this as we briefly discussed this on IRC today. \r\n\r\nMac OS X is getting stricter when it comes to deploying applications. Ever since the introduction of gatekeeper in OS X 10.9, and the rules being more strictly enforced since OS X 10.11 deploying an application on Mac OS X requires code signing to be effortless.\r\n\r\nThe approach Godot currently uses to deploy a zipped application bundle results in Mac OS X marking the application as quarantined after unzipping.\r\n\r\nYou can work around this by either turning off gatekeeper, manually clearing the quarantine flag, or after Mac OS X instructs you to do so, going to System Preferences->Security and selecting run anyway (this last option doesn't always work consistently I've found). \r\n\r\nThe nicer option would be to properly code sign the application. Apple no longer requires you to pay a $100 yearly fee to code sign unless you are deploying through the Apple store but the code signing process is only available on Mac OS X (though I have read somewhere you can export the signature as PKCS12 and apply the code signing on windows, worth investigating).\r\n\r\nOn OSX, provided the signatures are installed in your keychain you can simply use the [codesign](https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/codesign.1.html) command.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that was mentioned was to enabling creating a DMG instead of ZIP if we're running on Mac OS X and only use ZIP when exporting on another platform. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9313/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9312","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9312/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9312/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9312/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9312","id":237849303,"number":9312,"title":"Osx export","user":{"login":"BastiaanOlij","id":1945449,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1945449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij","html_url":"https://github.com/BastiaanOlij","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279097780,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:osx","name":"platform:osx","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279098255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:porting","name":"topic:porting","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-06-22T13:40:40Z","updated_at":"2017-06-30T22:07:30Z","closed_at":"2017-06-24T02:22:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/9312","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9312","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9312.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9312.patch"},"body":"I reimplemented the OSX export code that had been disabled, I think I got it pretty much working as it should.

Create a SpatialMaterial in the Materials slot, and start adding the attached textures to the object.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you're having the same problem, because I think either I did something wrong with the normalmapping or that the import process needs a tweak for normalmapping.\r\n\r\n![powerpost_rim](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5027750/27427171-e51f9736-56f2-11e7-8c6a-7798633f25bd.png)\r\n![powerpost_roughness](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5027750/27427172-e521edec-56f2-11e7-9930-69df4108cf33.png)\r\n![powerpost_albedo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5027750/27427174-e523a6dc-56f2-11e7-8b71-1c8bd24ef475.png)\r\n![powerpost_normal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5027750/27427173-e52328ec-56f2-11e7-8610-d5905bfccddd.png)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9310","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9310/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9310/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9310/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/9310","id":237763305,"number":9310,"title":"NormalMaps (NORMAL) not working on Tilesets","user":{"login":"rubenjavier","id":15718876,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15718876?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenjavier","html_url":"https://github.com/rubenjavier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenjavier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenjavier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenjavier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenjavier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenjavier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenjavier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenjavier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenjavier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenjavier/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-06-22T08:06:19Z","updated_at":"2017-06-26T20:47:12Z","closed_at":"2017-06-26T20:47:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device -
