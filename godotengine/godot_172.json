When putting a bunch of instances of them on a GridContainer, and trying to switch focus using tab produces a Crash to Desktop \n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nTo do this I created two scenes:\n-one with a container and a GridContainer.\n-one that is the button.

using the template as this is a very general issue.)\n\nBy design, Godot's rasterizer setups shaders for both 2D and 3D elements as they are needed during render. It creates different versions of each shader for any context it's used on, with different set of defines for every case.\n\nThis is sensible as long as it would be a waste of time and memory to precompile every shader for every use case. For instance, if a material in 3D is never used in the alpha pass, that variant won't ever get compiled. There are a number of combinations for both 2D and 3D materials.\n\nThe downside is that **the first frame of a scene just loaded with several different materials/shaders takes much more time because of the compilation of shaders, causing a noticebale hiccup**. And, as long as I can guess, as soon as any mesh or sprite with a not-yet-compiled shader enters the viewport it will happen again.\n\nIn my game I'm calling `VisualServer.draw()` on the main scene's `_ready()` to force compilation of at least the shaders needed for the first screen without affecting the timing, thus avoiding the hiccup.\n\nIs there any reasonable implementation that could avoid that yet being more reliable?\n\nI'm willing to implement it. I even started adding a method, `VisualServer.prepare_all_materials()`, but precompiling every combination is cumbersome and wasteful so I need a better approach.\n\nDoes anybody know how is this handled in other engines?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6712","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6712/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6712/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6712/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/6712","id":181024316,"number":6712,"title":"fix

system or device - Godot version:**\n2.1 stable\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nAnimating spritesheets is becoming a real pain in the ass. I have no idea what is going with the AnimationPlayer anymore :(\n\nTake this spritesheet for example:\n\n![normal-punch](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10387670/19065318/bbfc23d6-89c7-11e6-82ce-aad34f40ad9f.png)\n\n5 frames.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n- Add a Sprite and AnimationPlayer node \n- Change Sprites texture to the above sprite\n- Create a new animation, name it \"puncher\"\n- Set the animation length to 0.3\n- Set the Sprite's `VFrames` to `1`, and `HFrames` to `5`\n- Insert a keyframe at 0 seconds for the first `frame` (`0`)\n- Now, go to the last time in the timeline (0.3seconds) and insert a new keyframe for `frame`. The last fame is index `4` (0,1,2,3,4) = 5 frames. \n- It will show the punching sprite with the label \"5\"\n- Now on the animation track, set the animation mode to `Continuous`. So it looks something like this:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10387670/19065508/d16db544-89c8-11e6-98d3-9eabede519c1.png)\n\nNow, start to drag the line in the animation player from left to right (Beginning to End), **it stops on frame 4? Why?**\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10387670/19065585/3137cbb8-89c9-11e6-9cd9-d356845636a5.png)\n\nBut, you can actually fix this, buy clicking on the last keyframe, and changing the value to `5`:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10387670/19065608/49d50a78-89c9-11e6-9a92-fb8705405545.png)\n\nThen, when you click enter, it will still show 4 (since there is only 4 frames in the spritesheet, counting index) so that's correct. But, now drag the animation timeline from left to right again... It now stops on frame 5 which is correct..\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10387670/19065636/6e65b02c-89c9-11e6-844f-56aa683ab1c8.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6697/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4821","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"D3F8:572B:CFB3B3:1B6FC7A:59D69C62","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=173>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=171>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"4a98c95830c36f0343fd22b0b5d95899\"","status":"200 OK"}}
