again, NOT from `_ready()` - that works.\r\n\r\nBtw - when i was creating minimal example project, i noticed that if you set `Emit_timeout` to any float >= `Lifetime` (in my example, lets say 3.1) it looks like it start AFTER `Emit_Timeout` (3.1 sec) and i have strong feeling that it is related.\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\nquick and dirty example: [buggy_emit.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/1091268/buggy_emit.zip) -

mappings with device numbers above zero.  This is because:\r\n\r\n1) InputEvents are serialized using the new generic Variant::Object serialization approach, which writes an object's member variables in a json-ish format (see variant_parser.cpp)\r\n2) The device number is not written or read because it is set and retrieved using functions (InputEvent.get_device() and InputEvent.set_device(device))\r\n\r\nI would fix this by making InputEvent.device a public variable, but if I did that I would probably also want to remove get_device and set_device because they are redundant, which would be a breaking change.\r\n\r\nWe should discuss the best way to fix this case, but we should probably also talk about how we will generically solve the \"serializing/deserializing getters and setters\" class of problems.\r\n\r\nSemi-related question: Are there guidelines for when member variables should be hidden behind getters and setters in the godot codebase?  In the case of \"device\", get_device() just reads InputEvent.device and set_device(device) just writes to InputEvent.device.  Why does InputEvent.device need getters and setters, but public member variables like InputEvent.pressed don't?\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n1. map non-zero joypad in \"Input Map\" screen\r\n2. save project \r\n3. reopen project\r\n4. observe that the mapping is saved, but the device number is set to zero\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9299/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9298","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9298/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9298/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9298/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/9298","id":237373073,"number":9298,"title":"Can't edit StreamTexture flags","user":{"login":"homer666","id":27100585,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/27100585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666","html_url":"https://github.com/homer666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-06-20T23:27:35Z","updated_at":"2017-06-24T21:26:28Z","closed_at":"2017-06-21T01:42:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\r\nGodot master - 3c1fd26\r\nLinux Mint 18.1 Cinnamon x64\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nThe ability to set flags for a StreamTexture resource in the Inspector hasn't been implemented.

I started on designing the editor using GraphEdit and GraphNode classes. Those are great, but were initialy designed to handle \"port-based\" application.\r\nIn my case, I have no interest in using ports, but rather create transitions between nodes. Also I wanted to be able to modify the title bar to add the possibility to edit the node name (with a double click), which is not possible with the current implementation.\r\n\r\nI wanted to suggest a new design for graph nodes that would split the graph nodes functionnalities into multiple parts:\r\n- The GraphNode class becomes a generic container which only handles generic functions such as: resizability, offset on the graph...\r\n\r\nThen two possibilities:\r\n- We create a GraphNodePort class inheriting from GraphNode that implements all missing features.\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n- We create a PortContainer class that just extends the Container class with a set of displayed ports.\r\n- We create a GraphNodePort class that includes this PortContainer class along with an HBoxContainer to create a top title / tool bar (or we built in from scratch into each editor depending on each specific needs).\r\n\r\nI think the last solution is cleaner, as it truely split the functionalities and allow a very flexible design of graph nodes.\r\n\r\nI could work on that but I would like to have more opinions about it.\r\nWhat do you think
