Margin in a StyleBoxTexture, it cuts off the bottom part of the StyleBox. And what's even more odd, it only happens when using a `Tree` node. It works perfectly fine under a Panel node and other nodes that let you use a custom `StyleBoxTexture`\r\n\r\nIn the image, the left is the tree and the right is the panel. Both using the same StyleBoxTexture.\r\n\r\nI dug a bit deeper but got lost in the C++ code\r\n# Tree.cpp\r\nhttps://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/scene/gui/tree.cpp#L2774\r\n\r\nThis line looks like it's using almost  the same code as panel.cpp.\r\n\r\nHowever it has this before the actual draw method is called:\r\n```\r\nPoint2 draw_ofs;\r\ndraw_ofs += bg->get_offset();\r\nSize2 draw_size = get_size() - bg->get_minimum_size();\r\n```\r\n\r\n**_Except_**  --- `draw_ofs` and `draw_size` is not being used in:\r\n`bg->draw(ci, Rect2(Point2(), get_size()));` \r\n\r\n# Panel.cpp\r\nhttps://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/scene/gui/panel.cpp#L35\r\n\r\nIt looks like the same code is used the only difference I see is it's using the word \"bg\" instead  \"panel\", but that doesn't matter, right?\r\n\r\nWhy is the clip happening and where is it coming from?
