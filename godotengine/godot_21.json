system or device, Godot version, GPU Model and driver (if graphics related):**\r\nFedora 25 with the latest 2.1 branch of godot.\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nIf an area has a single RayShape and it's length is long enough to collide with an object that's reported, and using a script to set it's length low enough to no longer collide causes it to report no more collisions.\r\n\r\nHowever. Doing the opposite reports no collisions for both states. This doesn't seem to be an issue with the physics server as setting the length to what it is already doesn't change the reported collisions.\r\n\r\nI tried to track down the get_length() method in shape_sw.h and shape_sw.cpp but could only find get_length(). I'm not great with C++ and am not that experienced in maintaining godot but regardless I have very little idea what's causing the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nGithub zip sharing isn't working for me but I've made a **very** minimal project repo (with instructions in the readme) linked below. Running it once and pressing return reports that the area is no longer colliding however if you change the RayShape in the editor to length 2 and change the script to set it to 5 it wont report the collision.\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\nhttps://github.com/zavb074/RayAreaBugExample","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11253","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11253/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11253/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11253/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/11253","id":257564335,"number":11253,"title":"Improved

PR has evolved a bit. Here is a recap:\r\n\r\n- Fix  a bug in the Generic6DOFJoint, angles were wrong because Basis::get_euler() uses a different convention than the previous method and YXZ convention was used while the XYZ is required.\r\n- Fix a bug in the BodySW::_update_inertia_tensor() method. The Basis::scale() method was multiplying from the right, but now it multiplies from the left.\r\n- Simplify the Basis::get_euler() method. Not sure if the implementation was causing problems in the Generic6DOFJoint, but now it is equivalent to the one that was written in the Generic6DOFJoint (It was borrowed from Bullet I think).\r\n\r\nNot sure if point 3 can cause problems in other parts of the engine, I think it was @tagcup to introduce that change so I need his opinion.\r\nThis definitely fixes https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/11131 and likely other bugs\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11249/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11248","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11248/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11248/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11248/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/11248","id":257518042,"number":11248,"title":"Fix
