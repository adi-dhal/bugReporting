It'd nice to have that too.\n\n---\n\nSay I have a code like this:\n\n``` GDScript\nfunc my_func(parameter):\n    var variable\n```\n\nWith the current behavior, if I start typing `varia` it'll suggest `variable` as it was previously defined. If I start typing `param` it won't suggest `parameter`.\n\nMy proposition is that `parameter` should also be suggested for autocompletion.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2519/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2518","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2518/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2518/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2518/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/2518","id":108019946,"number":2518,"title":"Add

topic is of course \"IMO\".\n\nWhen opening a Godot project in current master, the filesystem dock looks like that:\n![fs1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4701338/10059235/25382ab2-624a-11e5-9bbf-c3419d997478.jpg)\nI do believe that not so long ago, it used to also show files and not only folders. One could expand folders in the tree to access files directly with single clicks.\n\nNow one can only double click to open folder, and then get:\n![fs2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4701338/10059267/4f1355e6-624a-11e5-8cf4-71eb42d3ee79.jpg)\nHere the interface changes completely, even the buttons at the top are different. With a bit of tweaking one can find that the tree icon on the left brings back to the first screenshot, and there again there is no obvious way to switch back to the non-tree view apart from opening a folder.\n\nThen by clicking the \"list\" icon one can get the listing without preview, which is better IMO for projects with many files (that's of course subjective, so it's nice to have both possibilities).\n![fs3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4701338/10059306/845c194a-624a-11e5-88f8-c07fae1a87d3.jpg)\n\nSo I see actually two \"problems\":\n- Files missing from the tree is IMO a regression. Browsing the filesystem via the tree view is the most effective in my workflow.\n- The fact that UI buttons differ in the tree view and in the other views is a bit confusing IMO. It would probably be better to have the same icons, and be able to switch between all three layouts using three icons.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2516","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2516/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2516/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2516/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2516","id":108008564,"number":2516,"title":"Tooltip help shows badly parsed newlines","user":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-09-23T21:18:27Z","updated_at":"2015-10-17T13:07:09Z","closed_at":"2015-10-17T13:07:09Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"The tooltip help for the Y sort function recently documented is as shown here:\n![contextual-help](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4701338/10059062/0bf270cc-6249-11e5-9623-fa3fe5ba119d.jpg)\n\nThe corresponding description is however:\n\n```\n        <method name=\"set_y_sort_mode\">\n            <argument index=\"0\" name=\"enable\" type=\"bool\">\n            </argument>\n            <description>\n            Set the Y sort mode.
