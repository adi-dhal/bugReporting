Or does it differ, depending on the OS?\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nBut the section after that, about building the templates, contradicts the whole thing:\n\n```\nC:\\godot> cp bin/libgodot_android.opt.debug.so platform/android/java/libs/armeabi\n```\n\nand\n\n```\nC:\\godot> cp bin/libgodot_android.opt.so platform/android/java/libs/armeabi\n```\n\nApart from also using `bin/` and the underscore in the source path, in both cases, there is the additional `opt` or `debug` part, and the target path does not rename it. I wonder:\n- Does this mean that there are now three files in the `armeabi` directory?\n- If this creates the templates, then what does the above section (with the `libgodot_android.so`) create?\n- If I run `ant debug`, which of those three libraries does it use? What if I run `ant release`?\n- Which of those libraries will it include in the template APKs? All three? (My self-generated templates are huge, compared to the templates from your website.)\n- What did I do wrong, to have the Pong example result in ~180MB (!!) when installed on Android.\n\nBecause I just tried to write a small build script to rebuild everything after a git pull, and I can’t tell what’s the correct procedure.\n\nIf you could improve that wiki page, I would be soo happy. :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/996/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/995","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/995/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/995/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/995/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/995","id":52429246,"number":995,"title":"Installer Crashes","user":{"login":"misterborden","id":10237866,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10237866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterborden","html_url":"https://github.com/misterborden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterborden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterborden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterborden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterborden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterborden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterborden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterborden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterborden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterborden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2014-12-18T23:19:43Z","updated_at":"2015-02-17T23:32:18Z","closed_at":"2015-02-17T23:32:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"godot_win64-1.0stable.exe crashes almost immediately.

seen many functions whose functionality, input and output parameters are not explained. Even whole classes. (Like SceneTree.)\n\nAlso certain things do not turn up in the code completion, even though they are documented.\n\nSo in terms of being usable, there’s no point in adding new features, if the old ones can’t even be used properly due to lacking documentation.\n\nThat’s why I really hope you complete the documentation as a high priority. (Preferably by having the code documented, and generating the wiki pages (and code completion data) from that.\n(Showing short descriptions of the functionality and parameters right in the code completion would of course be even cooler.)\n\nI also hope bug can serve as a marker for complete documentation of everything up to the 1.0 release. \n\nThank you.

the section says the dot product is hard to understand and makes no sense.\nBut I’ve found a really nice and intuitive way to think about it:\n\n> The dot product simply is the indicator for how much two vectors have in common.\n> The bigger, in relation to their magnitudes, the more two vectors have in common.\n> Simple. :)\n\nI think that it’s hard / makes no sense is a false meme,\nand it’s just the explanation we learned it from that has always been bad,\nwhich instilled fear, and _caused_ us to have trouble understanding it _in the first place_.\n\nSo I hope you can add the above explanation,\nand remove the lines about it being hard or making no sense.
