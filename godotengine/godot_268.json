However, I'm not sure what's the objective behind it, unless to get an algorithmic complexity of O(1), to which I say that [jump tables do not imply that we have O(1) lookup](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1837986/4103007) (source to be thoroughly verified, although it's what I also learned from data structures class).  \nEven if we do get instant lookup, the code is a far cry from being good-looking (read \"maintainable\").\n\nInstead of using them, at least in some instances, it's best to use an array of constant function pointers. I was going to start writing this and send a PR but I lack the knowledge to turn on inlining (or add -finline-functions to CFLAGS) with the current `scons` setup.\n\nIf you prefer using case switches for these cases (no pun intended), I'll drop this subject.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3835","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3835/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3835/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3835/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/3835","id":136548476,"number":3835,"title":"Flashing tooltip in editor","user":{"login":"Bonkuraazu","id":11808069,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/11808069?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bonkuraazu","html_url":"https://github.com/Bonkuraazu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bonkuraazu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bonkuraazu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bonkuraazu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bonkuraazu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bonkuraazu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bonkuraazu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bonkuraazu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bonkuraazu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bonkuraazu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":205417413,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:windows","name":"platform:windows","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":283518733,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"007700","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-02-25T23:46:59Z","updated_at":"2016-05-20T11:56:42Z","closed_at":"2016-05-20T11:56:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"OS/version: Windows10 64bit/Godot2.0stable\n\nThis is a duplicate issue, but the previous one has been closed\n(https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/1959).\nI posted on reddit to see if anyone else was still having this issue and got a confirmation\n(https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/47lwv0/anyone_else_having_this_issue_with_the_ui_tooltip/).\n\nThe tooltip seems to flash on and off when you hover your cursor over a ui element.
