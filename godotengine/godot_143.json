adds a recusion depth option to the YSort node which allows nodes from multiple sub-nodes to be drawn in y-order. This is especially helpful when you want to use multiple tilemaps which should be y-sorted together (which isn't possible at the moment).\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, I had to rewrite a bit of the canvas item rendering code. It is now a little bit more complicated and every canvas item uses a bit more memory, even if YSort isn't being used at all. I ran some tests though (Bunnymark) with and without the modification and it seems that there is no noticable difference for me. \r\n\r\nI don't know if anyone  but me wants this feature at all, but I decided to make a PR anyway because why not. As I said, it doesn't have any noticable impact for me, and if it's fine for anyone else it could as well be merged.

Default = `*`\r\n- `listen` uses the socket type of the bind address, or dual stack in case of wildcard (falling back to IPv4 on OpenBSD since this platform does not support dual stacking).\r\n- `connect` and `set_send_address` always resolves IP using `AF_UNSPEC` (preferred interface for given hostname) and creates a socket of the given address type (in case of UDP only if not already active).\r\n- all references to `set_ip_type` as been removed since testing specific IP type can be done by proper binding and manually calling resolve_hostname with specified type.\r\n\r\nDuring the testing I also found some bugs, and odd behaviors which I fixed here's a summary (see details in commit log):\r\n- UDP poll was trying to recv even if the socket was closed\r\n- Trying to write to a connecting TCP stream could result in deadlock since the polling from connecting to connected status was done in blocking mode.\r\n- UDP did not initialize and reset the receive buffer properly when used in \"client mode\" (no listen)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7580","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7580/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7580/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7580/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/7580","id":201832256,"number":7580,"title":"Add

\r\nI've done some shallow research on the subject. A few cases were mentioned of `_` being used as a wildcard being the idiomatic way to do a wildcard match.\r\n\r\n**Haskell** wildcard patterns use `_` for wildcards[[1]](https://www.haskell.org/tutorial/patterns.html). However, a valid Haskell variable name must begin with a lowercase[[2]](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Variables_and_functions#cite_note-1).\r\n**Scala** also uses `_` as a wildcard[[1]](http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/tour/pattern-matching.html). Scala uses the `_` for more than just pattern matching[[2]](http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/naming-conventions.html).\r\n**Elm** uses `_` in pattern matching as a wildcard that is not going to be used. It uses a lowercase 'tags' to match anything if you want to use the value[[1]](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/elm/) \r\n**Racket**, as far as I can tell, uses `_` as a placeholder variable name, but I couldn't find any reference to it being a symbol especially restricted to wildcards or wildcards being restricted to using `_`[[1]](https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/match.html)\r\n**F#**, uses `_` as a wildcard pattern[[1]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/fsharp/language-reference/pattern-matching), \r\n**OCaml** uses `_` as a wildcard pattern[[1]](http://xahlee.info/ocaml/pattern_matching.html)\r\n**Rust** uses `_` as a wildcard pattern[[1]](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/patterns.html)\r\n\r\nTwo options, make `_` an invalid variable name or use something else for wildcards in the GDscript's `match` pattern.\r\n\r\nThere's also the chance that whatever we use as a wildcard here could be used in other places in the future. I'd prefer it if we used `*` since it could also be used if GDscript ever got argument list *like in python* (I'm not aware of whether this is implemented or will ever be)\r\n\r\nI want to start a discussion around this, because I believe this can decide the future direction of the language.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7575/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7574","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7574/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7574/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7574/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7574","id":201689140,"number":7574,"title":"Fix
