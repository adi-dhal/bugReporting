like PARAM_ANGLE_DEG, i think is too much bloat, there shoul be only one rotation type function either in degrees or radians and use deg2rad or rad2deg, also it is confusing that angles in the editor are expressed in degrees whereas angles in scripts are expresed in radians, probabily theres a good reason for that, but for beginners i dont think that is friendly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4643/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":1,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4642","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4642/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4642/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4642/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4642","id":154574257,"number":4642,"title":"Ability

description** \nI'm working on my project - pseudo [terminal emulator for Godot](https://github.com/TeddyDD/gtern). It's basicly rewrite of my old project using new Godot features. Every time I try to add line \n`if x <= size.x:` to `transfer_to()` method in [buffer.gd](https://github.com/TeddyDD/gtern/blob/master/addons/terminal/buffer.gd) Godot crashes.\n\nIt should looks like this\n\n``` gdscript\nfunc transfer_to(buffer):\n    for y in buffer.size.y:\n        if y <= size.y:\n```\n\n`size` is Vector2D \n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n1. Open my project in Godot\n2. Open buffer.gd\n3. Try to add `if y <= y.size:` line in `transfer_to(buffer):` method at the beggining of first loop (`for y in buffer.size.y`) \n**Note** I know that that line of code wouldn't work and I shoud use `range()` but I suppose that does not matter for now.\nProject itself works, you can run it, works as expected.\n\nI captured little video to show the issue:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-6zQ851g7g&feature=youtu.be\n\nGodot output: https://gist.github.com/TeddyDD/842a54a7fd045b202af1a0ccb0541297\n\nThis line might be relevant (or not?): https://github.com/TeddyDD/gtern/blob/master/addons/terminal/terminal.gd#L45 It was called by signal before _ready() (font was null) I'm talking about this because of this line from Godot output\n\n```\nERROR: emit_signal: Error calling method from signal 'resized': 'Control(terminal.gd)::_on_resize': Method not found.\n   At: core/object.cpp:1210.\n```\n\n**Link to minimal example project** \nHere is my project https://github.com/TeddyDD/gtern\n\nSorry if this not very precise issue description but this is pretty weird :confused:\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4641/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4640","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4640/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4640/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4640/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4640","id":154546510,"number":4640,"title":"Original array is affected when changed in function","user":{"login":"mateusak","id":18586380,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/18586380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateusak","html_url":"https://github.com/mateusak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateusak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateusak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateusak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateusak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateusak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateusak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateusak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateusak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateusak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-05-12T18:11:59Z","updated_at":"2016-05-12T21:26:15Z","closed_at":"2016-05-12T21:13:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\nWindows 10 Pro - Godot 2.0.2\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nWhen an array is set into a function, it also affects the original one.
