can be use full in some case. Example :\r\n\r\nIn my game I've got a `GridContainer` which holds a list of `Control`s. Each of these `Control`s have a `Sprite`. I scale each sprite to fill all the `Control` space. But, if the texture does not have the exact aspect ratio of the `Control`, the `Sprite` will draw outside of the `Control`. What I done is to compute the texture region rectangle to have the exact aspect ratio. Even if the logic and the math behind this isn't really hard, it can be a problem to beginners in games development.

it be possible to add functions that return \"processing\" time and \"fixed processing\" time, which would return the value you would get (in principle, ignoring precision issues) if you added processing or fixed processing deltas to some accumulator every frame. A sort of \"engine\" time, affected by things like pausing, as opposed to \"real\" time.  \r\nThis would be useful for instance to keep track of cooldowns without active processing, by simply storing the time the cooldown would end in a variable and then comparing that to the current processing time.  \r\nI would guess the engine keeps track of it anyway, so it shouldn't be too hard to simply expose it to
