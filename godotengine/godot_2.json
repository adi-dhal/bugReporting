To make the usage easier, those\r\nfunction pointers in the struct can be wrapped in actual function in\r\nthe global scope.

system or device, Godot version, GPU Model and driver (if graphics related):**\r\nTested it under Linux, with latest build from master\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\n<!-- What happened, and what was expected. -->\r\n**UPDATE: The self contained mode works as expected, the problem was located inside the mono module. So no need to read the wall of text anymore :)** \r\n\r\nSo the \"self contained mode\" is a mode to start Godot without touching the system wide configuration of a previous started Godot session. It's very useful if you test different versions of Godot on your system and want to avoid to interfere with other versions. \r\nHere the description from the docs:  \r\nhttp://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/development/compiling/packaging_godot.html?highlight=self-contained#self-contained-mode\r\n\r\nNow I already had the impression that it didn't work perfectly in Godot 3.0, but to really be sure about it I removed all files (also the invisible ones) from both the system wide path where Godot per default saves its configuration(s) and the one in my folder from where I test Godot with the self contained mode.\r\nHere the before picture:  \r\n![issue_self-contained-mode_before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16520617/31145393-f04fd2d2-a883-11e7-8f88-889c9b414911.png)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, everything is deleted in this picture.  \r\nNow to clarify: The folder on the top is the one where Godot saves its default configuration(s), so in this case under Linux it's **\"~/.godot/\"**. While at the bottom you find two views from the same empty folder where I test Godot starting in self contained mode. Before I started I did as usual, so copied the clean built binaries, in this case godot.x11.opt.tools.64, godot.x11.opt.tools.64.debug and GodotSharpTools.dll (because testing the newly added Mono support and to prove the point) and created a new empty \"._sc_\" file like I always do since Godot 2.x.  Now when starting Godot in this mode normally it should create a **\"editor_data\"** folder in which it will then put all the configuration stuff (and also templates etc. if you import any). The problem is not that it doesn't work, indeed it works, but just not perfectly. As you can see as soon as I started it, it also created two folders in the system wide Godot configuration folder (which should not happen in this mode):  \r\n![issue_self-contained-mode_after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16520617/31145915-522bf552-a885-11e7-9119-63de026ee5b3.png)  \r\n\r\nNow it created the two folders: \"app_userdata\" and \"mono\". In case of app_userdata, it held a folder inside of a game project that I quickly created to test (you can see at the bottom that I also created a \"GameProjects\" folder in which it has been saved. Now that \"Test_Game\" folder inside \"app_userdata\" was empty. But in case of \"mono\" it wasn't indeed it held the folders for mono's building logs and two folder for the solution files of GodotSharp and GodotSharpEditor. Now most of the stuff got into \"editor_data\" but the mono folder didn't. Talking with @neikeq he said it could be an issue with the \"**get_settings_path()**\" function in \"**EditorSettings**\", as it should return exe_path + \"editor_data\" for the self-contained mode. On a second note other folders are as expected within the \"editor_data\" folder in the self contained folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n\r\n1. Delete all the content in the default configuration folder of Godot (~/.godot/ or equivalent for Windows and OS X)  \r\n\r\n2. choose a empty folder where you want to test Godot in self contained mode and create a empty file called \"**._sc_**\" in it. \r\n\r\n3. make a clean build of Godot with the targets set as you please (but consider trying it with module_mono_enabled=yes so you can test the behavior)\r\n\r\n4. copy the binarie(s) to the folder where you have created the \"**._sc_**\" file and execute Godot. Maybe create also a simple project (1 node is enough and save the scene), so you can also see that it still creates the \"**app_userdata**\" (and the mono folder) where Godot would per default save them when **not** run in self contained mode.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11812","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11812/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11812/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11812/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/11812","id":262546241,"number":11812,"title":"Fixed

scene file is externally modified no prompt is given of this conflict, if changes are made in Godot, saving will overwrite the external modifications to the scene file.\r\nIt should prompt the user whether or not to update the scene according to the new scene file or whether to overwrite these.\r\nIdeally it should prompt immediately as the external changes are made.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nCreate a scene, make a change and save.\r\nWith the scene still open in Godot then externally modify the scene file(i.e by git pulling a commit with modifications to the scene)\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\nAn example project with its own
