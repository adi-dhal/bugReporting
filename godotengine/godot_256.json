description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nI was trying to find what input library Godot uses, to look what features does it exhibit and if there are any metrics like latency etc. gathered for it. So I went to https://github.com/godotengine/godot/tree/master/drivers and couldn't understand what most of those directories contain.\n\nHere is the list:\n\n```\nalsa               - audio\nangle              - graphics\nbuiltin_openssl2   - network\nbuiltin_zlib       - utility/compression\nchibi              - ???\nconvex_decomp      - ???\ndds                 \netc1\ngl_context\ngles2             \njpegd\nmpc\nnedmalloc\nnrex\nogg\nopenssl           - network\nopus\npng\npnm\npulseaudio\npvr\nrtaudio\nspeex\nsquish\ntheora             - utilities/formats\nunix\nvorbis             - utilities/formats\nwebp               - utilities/formats\nwebpold\nwindows\n```\n\nAbove I tried to map few logical blocks to show what information I expect to find about them. As you may see I couldn't find the module that is responsible for input (like http://gainput.johanneskuhlmann.de/). Perhaps it is managed by Godot core directly, but I have no proof and not enough hours to read the code to figure this out.\n\nWhat would help is a colored diagram of components of Godot engine (even a list of blocks would find for the first approximation) - every color is a function of the component as shown above. Then a picture of how different functions are meld together, and which components are responsible for every function (color).\n\nI could do some ugly SVG's in Inkscape that could be improved later, but it would be nice to learn something from design/art gurus and get something inspiring as a result.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4188","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4188/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4188/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4188/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4188","id":144767444,"number":4188,"title":"Cannot

2.0.1-stable Win 10 64bit\n\nButtons that overload get_drag_data() and return a non falsey value don't change the texture properly when the drag finishes (active texture is left instead of the normal one)\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n- Create a new scene with a CanvasLayer main node. Set it's scale to 3,3 for better visibility.\n- Add a GridContainer\n- Add a Button element, set it's text to anything eg. `some text here`, create a new script and attach it\n- Insert some code that uses get_drag_data() eg.\n\n```\n    func get_drag_data(pos): return true\n    func can_drop_data(pos,data): return true\n    func drop_data(pos,data): pass\n```\n- Duplicate the button a few times\n- Start the scene\n- Click and drag a button to any other button. The original button's texture stays \"active\" instead of returning to \"normal\".\n- On a bugged button (with \"active\" texture), click to revert to \"normal\" texture. Note that hovering with TAB and using SPACE does not work.\n\nIt seems to not be bugged without get_drag_data(). To check this:\n1. Edit any of the button's script\n2. Comment the get_drag_data(pos) line\n3.
