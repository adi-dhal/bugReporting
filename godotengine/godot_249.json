`test.gd`\n- Put `extends \"res://myclass.gd\"` in the file\n- In both files, write some function definition (e.g. `func test():`)\n- In an indented block on the next line, try to write letters that some of the functions in `Sprite` start with, like `get` or `set`\n- You will not see completion for them in `test.gd`, but you will in `myclass.gd`\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional

Make everything properly aligned in nice columns somehow. (Will PR soon)\n2. Add a zoom option. ( Done in #4800 )\n3. Add an option to hide the names of tiles, since they are useless (take too much space) in some cases (like in the first pic).\n\n---\n\nTo future responders: Note that this issue is not a place to dump your latest tilemap editor idea -- you should preferably open a new issue for that.

I switch to another app and then back to Godot. The script gets reverted to the last saved version, and all my changes are lost!\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nI'm not sure how to trigger it. When working with Godot for a while, this starts to happen. Only one editor file seems to be affected. Closing the file and re-opening it fixes it. If I know more, I edit the issue. I simply focus another app, either by mouse or by keyboard (Alt+Tab), and when I go back to Godot, I shortly see the unsaved recent contents, and then them being immediately replaced by the last saved version.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4393","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4393/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4393/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4393/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4393","id":150138127,"number":4393,"title":"CollisionShape2D trigger doesn't behave as expected","user":{"login":"genete","id":346755,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/346755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/genete","html_url":"https://github.com/genete","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genete/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genete/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genete/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genete/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genete/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genete/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genete/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genete/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genete/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":283518839,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"ffbbff","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":370471880,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:physics","name":"topic:physics","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-04-21T17:19:59Z","updated_at":"2017-05-19T11:48:11Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device:**\nOSX  10.10.3\nGodot 2.0.2 stable official\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nOne moving KinematicBody2D with a shape set as trigger doesn't collide with other KinematicBody2D. \nAccording to the documentation:\n\n> A trigger shape detects collisions, but is otherwise unaffected by physics (i.e. will not block movement of colliding objects).\n\nI expect to detect the collision in the script but the body wouldn't stop its movement.

folks, I decided to try Godot for WinRT platform but i couldn't compile it. I know that WinRT is not officially supported, but anyway...\n\nThe first problem that i encountered what something related to Windows Store  and the fix was to comment [this line here](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/platform/winrt/detect.py#L51). \n\nAfter that it starts to compile the [gl_context_egl.h](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/platform/winrt/gl_context_egl.h) files. Here i got an error that it cannot find the namespace `Windows::UI::Core` but that was fixed with a single line like:\n`#include <windows.ui.core.h>`\n\nThen it starts to build the core components. This is where i reached the deadend. The [Error enum](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/core/error_list.h) conflicts with some system class that is named `Error`. \n\nAs a result i got [this huge error list](http://www.pasteall.org/68336).\n\nI am using Windows 10 x64, Visual Studio 2015 Community edition. I was using the ARM Developer Command prompt, as [described in the wiki](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/reference/compiling_for_universal_windows_apps.html).\n\nHowever there were no problems to build Godot for Windows platform.\n\nUpdate:\nThis could be helpful for the future researches: \n[Supported Win32 APIs for Windows Phone

up `set_applied_torque` and `get_applied_torque`, which existed in the physics server but weren't wrapped with `RigidBody2D` methods nor bound in GDScript.\n\nAdded a `get_inertia` method which returns the value, since they're probably much bigger than most people would expect. I didn't add a setter since the inertia appears to be automatically computed from the mass and the shapes. The inverse inertia is cached, so you _might_ be able to set it and it would stay until you changed a shape or the mass, but that's...probably not very useful, so I didn't add a setter function.\n\nI also documented the read-only nature of `get_inertia` and added the obvious (probably redundant) minimal description of the other two methods.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4387/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4744","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"E117:572B:D01CBA:1B7E2BF:59D69DA5","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=250>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=248>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"fa2787b88ea0a073e79aa166d20970a0\"","status":"200 OK"}}
