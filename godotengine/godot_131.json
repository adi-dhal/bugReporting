to think about implementing. I'm not sure what collada supports as I haven't got to the animation and rigging side of things for my current project. But there is an interesting file format for 3d. It might be worth investigating for use in godot?\r\n\r\nglTF github:\r\nhttps://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7952/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7951","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7951/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7951/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7951/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/7951","id":211930207,"number":7951,"title":"KinematicBody2D.move() doesn't work as intended","user":{"login":"RandomShaper","id":11797174,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11797174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper","html_url":"https://github.com/RandomShaper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-03-05T04:51:59Z","updated_at":"2017-03-06T06:49:40Z","closed_at":"2017-03-06T03:43:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\r\n~~Present from at least 2.1, surely in 3.0 as well~~\r\n~~Only relevant for 2.1 3.0 has its own issue.~~\r\nMore relevant for 2.1. Affectation for 3.0 is to be more deeply analyzed.\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nThe typical use case for kinematic bodies is to call move() and if a collision is detected, call move() again with the slide vector.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that subsequent calls to move() during the same fixed frame don't take into account the accumulated position. In other words, the movement for any call to move() is considered to depart from wherever the body was at the fixed step.\r\n\r\nI think such a big thing is barely noticeable because of the usual gravity keeping the body on the ground and some subtleties of the implementation.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if I'm right that's a big bug that makes things not work as smoothly as they should. Furthermore, problems arise when one tries to make multiple motion attempts for more complex behavior (that's how I realized something wasn't working properly).\r\n\r\nMaybe the 3D counterpart is also affected. Please someone confirm.\r\n\r\n**The issue on 3.0:**\r\n\r\nUPDATE: The 3.0 version has this somehow alleviated due to the \"from\" parameter for motion tests. But the implementation is still getting the AABBs of the shapes with the transform thas was applied at the beginning of the fixed step.\r\n\r\nSince the shapes' AABB cache is not updated until the `NOTIFICATION_TRANSFORM_CHANGED` received per frame, they are out-dated on a subsequent call to the motion methods.\r\n\r\n(See https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/f13e87e25799aafa4462779650c7d6222c782b31/servers/physics_2d/space_2d_sw.cpp#L613)\r\n\r\nUntransforming the shapes AABBs with the current known transform and then applying the \"from\" transform to them at that point in code should do the trick.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? A better way?\r\n\r\n**Solution:**\r\n\r\n~~I have a PR almost ready and it seems to work well both for my game and for the kinematic character example but I want to hear opinions as soon as possible.~~\r\n\r\n~~For 2.1 probably the wrong behavior should be left as the default to avoid breaking things so the fix comes as an optional thing.~~\r\n\r\nEDIT: PR already submitted for 2.1.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n(to be done)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7951/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7950","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7950/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7950/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7950/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7950","id":211911782,"number":7950,"title":"Expose

says.\r\nEverything works fine, but if I need change anything on my model, when export in Blender, Godot will automatic update everything, and the \"Bone Attachment\" will be deleted.\r\n\r\nI have worked with Unity before, but I have to say that I never had problem updating changes, but I'm having a hard time to understand the best workflow with Godot... how I'm supposed to work with \"Bone Attachment\", if everytime I update a scene get lost?\r\n\r\nMy english is not that good, sorry :D... so here a short video for help -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fzDFM5AE8g\r\n\r\nAlso the documentation is not really useful on this... so i'm not sure if is a issue or not. \r\nIn any case, I would like to suggest a better explanation on how deal with that on the documentation.\r\n\r\nThanks
