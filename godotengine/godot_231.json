new drag/drop features are brilliant! Would be great if you could also drag/drop a .msh file from the filesystem into the 3d viewport or the scene tree(where it would automatically create a new meshinstance node). Would make populating a 3d world much quicker then having to manually make new mesh instances each time.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4945/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4944","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4944/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4944/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4944/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4944","id":157590526,"number":4944,"title":"OUYA gamepad joystick movement/tilting causes game to crash on OUYA.","user":{"login":"Corruptinator","id":5027750,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5027750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Corruptinator","html_url":"https://github.com/Corruptinator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Corruptinator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Corruptinator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Corruptinator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Corruptinator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Corruptinator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Corruptinator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Corruptinator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Corruptinator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Corruptinator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097562,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:android","name":"platform:android","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":307135532,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:plugin","name":"topic:plugin","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":23,"created_at":"2016-05-31T05:04:35Z","updated_at":"2017-06-24T21:38:58Z","closed_at":"2017-06-22T16:51:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Windows 10, 64 bit; Godot Engine 2.0.3 (STABLE RELEASE)\n\nWhat happened is that after finding out that there has been improvements and updates to export any games from godot to the OUYA, I've decided to give it a test run to see how it goes, so far it starts up nicely and the framerate doesn't seem to stutter or fail. I've pressed the O,U,Y,A buttons and the D-pad and those work very well, but however the problem is that the instant I've started to tilt the gamepad joystick, the game instantaneously crashes\n\nI've tried separate empty projects to see if there were any instances of causing the same issue without using gdscript or any other method, but alas they all failed and crashed.\n\nSo it does export, but then later crashes after tilting the joystick on the OUYA gamepad. Could the X,Y,Z, controller axis be somehow affected by the OUYA's android OS?\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n1. Run ADB.exe\n2. Create any empty project and export it to any android or OUYA devices.\n3. Test all the buttons on the OUYA gamepad controller.\n4. After it crashes by tilting the OUYA gamepad joystick, run this command on ADB:\n   \" adb bugreport > bugreport.txt\" (Should be located in the [USERNAME] folder) and see if there is\n   any error related to the joystick crash.\n\nP.S. If anybody likes to request my bug report for this issue, please let me know so then I can post and share my results.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4944/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4943","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4943/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4943/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4943/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4943","id":157581082,"number":4943,"title":"Key
