than before.\r\n- The S in the audio solo icon is hard to read.\r\n- The audio icon should have different base color, this in a convention in audio engines, like it was before actually.

description:**\r\nShadowmapping results in multiple passes for rendering.

What happened, and what was expected. -->\r\n\r\nWhen importing a model, the default import settings for it's materials are set to \"Location: Mesh\" and \"Storage: Files\", however the materials used are \"Built-In\" instead of using the generated \"Files\".\r\n\r\nEdit: This is using the head commit of Godot 3 as of the writing of this issue.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n[Material_Import_Issue.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/1319567/Material_Import_Issue.zip)\r\n\r\nFiles supplied are for your convenience to skip steps 1 and 2 below.\r\n\r\n*Location: Mesh (Default, doesn't work as expected)*\r\n\r\n1) Create a model (IE. a cube in Blender)\r\n2) Export it to dae format using the Better Collada Exporter into your Godot project.\r\n3) Notice materials are generated into the folder alongside the dae file.\r\n    * This is expected since \"Files\" is the selected storage location.\r\n4) Add it as an instanced scene into another scene.\r\n5) Set it as having editable children\r\n6) Click on the MeshInstance Node, Mesh, then the Material\r\n7) Change the material\r\n8) Click save to save the material\r\n9) It asks to save a new material even though one was imported as a separate resource.\r\n    * In other words, the \"Files\" storage location import setting isn't causing the mesh to use the stored material, it's using a built-in one instead\r\n\r\n*Location: Node (Works as expected)*\r\n\r\nDo all of the above steps, except:\r\n1) Create a model (IE. a cube in Blender)\r\n2) Export it to dae format using the Better Collada Exporter into your Godot project.\r\n3) Materials are generated into the folder alongside the dae file, as expected.\r\n4) Change the import setting for Materials>Location to \"Node\"\r\n5) Add it as an instanced scene into another scene.\r\n6) Set it as having editable children\r\n7) Click on the MeshInstance Node, then under the Materials foldout click the Material\r\n8) Change the material\r\n9) Click save to save the material\r\n10) Notice it saves the material as expected since it's using the \"Files\" that it generated.\r\n\r\n**Attached Project Notes**\r\n\r\nIncludes only two Cube.dae files with their associated '.import' files, but one is set to \"Mesh\" as it's materials location and the other is set to \"Node\", but no '.import' directory is included so as to cause these dae files to freshly import when you open this project.\r\n\r\nThanks

1: Made a few refactoring changes to core/set.h**\r\n\r\n> _insert and _insert_rb\r\n- Changed `_insert_rb` to `insert_fix_rb` that deals only with fixing the rb colors on a node being inserted. So `_insert` and `_insert_fix_rb` match up better with `_erase` and `_erase_fix_rb`.(Logical)\r\n- Changed `_insert` so it is the function called by public functions, instead of `_insert_rb`.\r\n (Consistency)\r\n\r\n> _erase_fix\r\n- Changed `_erase_fix` to `_erase_fix_rb`. (Logical)\r\n\r\n> Other Changes\r\n- Mainly moving code around to provide a more logical ordering. (Readability)\r\n\r\n**Commit 2: Updated core/map.h to reflect similar changes made in #10748 and those above.**","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11444","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11444/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11444/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11444/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/11444","id":259241678,"number":11444,"title":"Editor crashes under some conditions","user":{"login":"djrm","id":1103897,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1103897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrm","html_url":"https://github.com/djrm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-09-20T17:27:30Z","updated_at":"2017-09-21T08:02:21Z","closed_at":"2017-09-21T08:02:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Operating system or device, Godot version, GPU Model and driver (if graphics related):**\r\ncd2ffdc6725aa6f7a9a4af6fd5abcc4cafae61b4\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\n<!-- What happened, and what was expected. -->\r\nthe editor crashes under certains conditions, it has happened to me when creating a new scene, or moving to 2D tab when im in a Script.\r\n\r\nheres the backtrace\r\n\r\n```\r\nhandle_crash: Program crashed with signal 11\r\nDumping the backtrace.

The underscores of the property name will automatically be changed to white spaces. For example, \"global_property\" will be changed to \"Global Property\". And while the property appears to be \"Global Property\", you have to  refer to it in the script as `Globals.get(\"global_property\")` instead of `Global.get(\"Global Property\")`.

Go to the Global tag. Add a global property with underscores in the name. The underscores would appear to be white spaces. Click on the newly created property. Press the delete button. You can't delete it unless you retype the original underscore version of the name in the text field.
