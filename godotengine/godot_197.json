When the TextEdit node receives an \"Enter\" action, I process the command. The problem is, if the cursor isn't placed at the end of the command, it places an unwanted newline character. Since this is supposed to accept multiple lines, I can't clean out all `\\n` entirely.\n\nSo I grab the position of the cursor before processing the command and select the newline (which works according to `get_selection_text()`), but when I use `insert_text_at_cursor()`, nothing happens and the string is untouched.\n\nHowever, [I take a look at the code](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/scene/gui/text_edit.cpp#L3206) and see nothing wrong, hence the question mark in the title.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**  \n1. Connect TextEdit node to `InputEvent()` signal\n2. Receive an \"Enter\" action\n3. Grab cursor position and select the newline\n4. Erase selection by using `insert_text_at_cursor()`\n5. Test it by entering any string and placing the cursor anywhere but the end\n6.

together tilemaps in godot is painful. Mainly because there's simply not enough tools to do it quickly and efficiently. I'll just give some ideas: \n\n**Automatic tileset from a texture** - relying on addons for such basic functionality isn't great. Besides, tile cutting addons don't have a lot of features (like tile naming or setting up collision) that should be there. Right now making a tileset in godot with it's default functionality should be considered a torture. \n\n**Randomizer** - If user selects more than one tile from the set, randomizer should kick in and randomly place one of the selected tiles on click. A lot of games use several variations of one tile so it's common to need some kind of randomization. In additional options it would be nice to have rotated and flipped tiles to appear randomly.\n\n**Tile Animation** - this is the big HUGE one. Some tiles are just supposed to be animated. Water, for example. Right now doing animation requires either setting up timer to go through each tile and update it, or making a shader for animating those. Neither of those is good and a lot of times more costly than it should be. Having some sort of mechanism for tile animation without a huge fuss would be great. \n\n**TileMap collision to NavMap** - a lot of the times, if you do collisions on your tiles, you might want to have a navmap from those collisions.\n\n_These ones are not as important but still would be a nice addition:_\n\n**Brush size** - maybe tiles are small. Maybe map is big. Maybe someone wants to do big strokes before making a more detailed map. Without brush size option you either put one tile at a time or bucket fill it all. \n\n**Less whitespace between tiles** - tiles don't need to take up so much space in tile picker and have huge margins. The more tiles you have on screen the easier it's to find the one you need.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5965/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5964","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5964/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5964/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5964/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5964","id":168359060,"number":5964,"title":"Typing

bug might be possible to do on every version of Godot\n\n**Description:**\n\nA scene has another scene as a child.\nIf you put to this child a child that is his parent, it will crash\n`e.g : \"game.tscn\" has\" settings.tscn\" as a child, \"settings.tscn\" has \"game.tscn\" as a child`\n\nIf a scene is _connected to one of the two scenes_, it will not be playable or editable.\nThe game will simply crash and the editor will too (_excepted if it's the first scene loaded,it will then just show an error message_).\n\nAlso, if you put this scene or one of the two that are creating the loop in the script editor\n`e.g : preload(\"node_not_working.tscn\")`\n_it will fail to check the existence of the scene_ and **crash**.\n\nThere are only two ways of fixing this : \n- having made backups\n- not using a binary format to save files, for you can edit the xml by yourslef\n\nI know this is a very dumb case, but it can happen while not watching when using the auto-fix of depencies, and then totally break a project.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5957","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5957/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5957/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5957/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5957","id":168236176,"number":5957,"title":"New

The name and thumbnail is that of one tile, but placing the tile in the map results in a different one.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n1. Create a scene and populate it with sprites.\n2. Convert the scene to a tileset (any format)\n3. Create a new scene and create a tilemap.\n4. Load the previously created tileset.\n5. Proceed through the list of tiles. Some of them do not look like their thumbnail once placed.\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\nI've attached an example project with a single scene demonstrating the issue.\nI have attempted to place two tiles, one called `fgSlantL` and the other called `fgSlopeR`. You can see what these tiles are supposed to look like in the thumbnail. However, when I actually place them, `fgSlantL` looks like `fgSlopeR` and vice versa.\n\n[StarsBelow.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/388068/StarsBelow.zip)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5948/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5947","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5947/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5947/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5947/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5947","id":168042860,"number":5947,"title":"(Auto-)update of assets","user":{"login":"bojidar-bg","id":5276727,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5276727?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg","html_url":"https://github.com/bojidar-bg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279097162,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/discussion","name":"discussion","color":"ee77ee","default":false},{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":391232995,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:assetlib","name":"topic:assetlib","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-07-28T08:42:11Z","updated_at":"2016-08-30T10:54:01Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"As mentioned in the (RIP) #4279 :\nIt would be nice to have a way to update assets that were installed from the asset library.
