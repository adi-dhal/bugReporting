New scene\n2. Add a Node2D root, and a sprite + an animation player\n3. Make a new (autoplay) animation, and animate sprite:transform/scale\n4. Set sprite's scale to `(0,0)`, it will be changed to some healthy minimum, and add keyframe\n5. Move the animation player to another time, and add keyframe for `(1,1)`\n6. Play the animation in the editor -> everything works just fine (sprite starts \"invisible\", finishes normal)\n7. Save as `.xscn` and play that scene only -> everything works just fine\n8. Save as `.tscn` and play that scene only -> sprite starts big, finishes normal\n9. Edit first key frame manually to become `(0,0)` and not `(0.00001,0.00001)` (this is the workaround ATM)\n10. Resave `.tscn` and play that scene only -> everything works just fine\n\nI think the bug comes from the fact that `0.00001` is saved as `1e-05`, but read as `105` in game, because:\n- When printing the scale every `_fixed_process`, I got:\n\n```\n# .xscn (step 7)\n0.00001,0.00001\n0.00001,0.00001\n#...\n1,1\n# .tscn (step 8)\n105,105\n105,105\n\n#...\n1,1\n```\n- Comparing the corresponding
