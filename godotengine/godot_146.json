this is a fun one cause I have no idea what would be the best way to start adding this into Godot as a feature.

No need to render more frames then the display can handle and no nasty flickering.\r\n\r\nProblem for me is, I'm rendering to textures and then outputting to a Vive HMD.\r\nThe vsync is limiting the framerate to 60fps, the vive requires me to up this to 90fps... Easy, disable the vsync and we start hitting way more then 90fps (just a test scene with boxes).\r\n\r\nHowever at the end we do want the Vive to run at something sensible like either 90fps or 120fps, but, especially if we render a 3rd camera point for what we show on screen, we'd like to lower that to something like 30fps. Nobody is gaming on the screen, the output is purely there for spectators and maybe screen capturing the output. Especially with an extra render pass, but also even if we duplicate the left eye texture we rendered for the vive, we'd like to only do this every so many frames.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7503","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7503/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7503/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7503/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/7503","id":200246481,"number":7503,"title":"Add gravity vector support to Android and UWP","user":{"login":"BastiaanOlij","id":1945449,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1945449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij","html_url":"https://github.com/BastiaanOlij","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279097562,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:android","name":"platform:android","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279098255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:porting","name":"topic:porting","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-01-12T00:23:07Z","updated_at":"2017-01-16T00:24:33Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is related to PR #7127 which sees introduction of gyro and magneto support to iOS.\r\nPart of that PR adds the gravity vector alongside the accelerometer data.

I was thinking about modernization of the audio engine. The main main reasons why Godot's audio engine was written as it is were:\r\n\r\nTraditionally, devices had little amount of memory until a few years ago. Additionally, decoding compressed audio by traditional libraries was CPU intensive and required allocating/deallocating memory (which is forbidden and must never be done in audio threads).\r\n\r\nThis combination of facts resulted in audio implementations where streaming audio (music) and samples (sound effects) had to be divided. Streaming happened from disk (OGG files in Godot are streamed from disk), while samples are played from memory, generally uncompressed.\r\n\r\nThe method for streaming music works like this:\r\n\r\n-A thread decodes the audio from disk, then fills a ringbuffer\r\n-The audio thread reads from the ringbuffer and writes audio\r\n\r\nThis method has the drawback that streaming or any kind of change to the audio results in high latency, and seeking, resampling, etc. is hard. \r\n\r\nNowadays computers and mobile devices have plenty of memory, so loading the ogg fles into memory and streaming them from there (just like you would do for regular sound effects) could probably be possible without much of a problem... however one problem remains: \r\n\r\nBoth libogg and libvorbisfile perform memory allocations during decode, which makes the library unsuitable for streaming from the audio thread.\r\n\r\nSo it crossed my head today, what if there was a way to stram vorbis, mp3 or any other format from memory directly? without allocating memory? nowadays you can have a full thread for this.. did no one think of this? We could unify the SAMPLE/STREAM classes in Godot if this was possible.\r\n\r\nThis is when I remembered stb_vorbis.c , which is an alternative implementation of Vorbis. I  discarded it back in the day because it lacked seeking support, so I went to check today and I found this:\r\n\r\n// Originally sponsored by RAD Game Tools. Seeking sponsored\r\n// by Phillip Bennefall, Marc Andersen, Aaron Baker, Elias Software,\r\n// Aras Pranckevicius, and Sean Barrett.\r\n\r\nAha! Someone did this reasoning before, Aras is one of the leads of Unity, so I definitely was on the right track :)\r\n\r\nSo, for the new audio engine, my proposal is to ditch all audio formats that are RT Unsafe (Opus and Vorbis bia libvorbisfile) and simply use std_vorbis and wav (via ima-adpcm)  instead.  This would allow us to use AudioStream for pretty much everything and enormously simplify the audio engine.\r\n\r\nThe only reason we could still support Opus is due to the very good voice compression ratio (great or in-game voice), but we would not support it as an AudioStream (unless we can figure out a way to stream it in a realtime-safe mode somehow).\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7496/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7495","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7495/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7495/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7495/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7495","id":199869761,"number":7495,"title":"More

The thing that makes life more complex is that the camera properties set in Godot (fov, near and far plane) are copied into the renderer. In Godot 2 these properties were (re)used in various places but I can see that most of that code has been replaced by evaluating the projection matrix (camera_matrix). \r\n\r\nWhat I suggest changing in visual_server_scene is to change the camera structure and replace size, fov, near and far plane by the camera matrix. The existing camera_set_perspective and camera_set_orthogonal are changed to calculate the matrix from the given parameters and we add a new function:\r\ncamera_set_projection(RID p_camera, camera_matrix& p_matrix)\r\nthat simply sets the camera type to Camera::PERSPECTIVE and copies the supplied matrix.\r\n\r\nThe function render_camera can be simplified as we simply use the matrix that was already set.\r\n\r\nThe end result is that we can use more complex projection matrices without having to duplicate a lot of logic inside of visual_server_scene. Instead our camera object can calculate, or simply supply, the correct projection matrix to the render logic. When I did my initial work on stereoscopic cameras I did add all the duplicate logic into the visual server which is something I wasn't particularly happy with\r\n\r\nFor stereoscopic calculations for generic platforms the left and right eye matrices will be different and have additional settings such as IOD (distance between the eyes) and convergence (distance from viewer where left and right eyes overlap).\r\n\r\nBoth Vive and Rift will supply the matrices through their API as the IOD is controlled on the headset itself and the convergence is non-negotiable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7478/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7477","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7477/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7477/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7477/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/7477","id":199461038,"number":7477,"title":"Game Window spawns top-right","user":{"login":"htory327","id":7143325,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7143325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/htory327","html_url":"https://github.com/htory327","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htory327/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htory327/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htory327/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htory327/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htory327/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htory327/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htory327/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htory327/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htory327/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097780,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:osx","name":"platform:osx","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":279098255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:porting","name":"topic:porting","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":283518733,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"007700","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-01-09T00:55:28Z","updated_at":"2017-06-27T18:04:47Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\r\nMacOSX El Capitan 10.11.5\r\nGodot Engine 2.1.1\r\n\r\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\r\n\r\nWhen I play a scene (or project) the game window spawns top-right and it's really annoying I want it to start at the center.\r\n\r\nWeird thing is it worked (and still works) on previous version (2.0.x?)\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n\r\nEditor Settings > Game Window Placement > ...\r\nRect: Centered\r\nRect Custom Position: 0, 0\r\n\r\n**Screenshot**\r\n![ss](http://hnng.moe/f/MJi)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4847","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"8F0B:01FA:B4F182:196FB1F:59D69BF9","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=147>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=145>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"acb1ef826efe396260d1fda80779bd75\"","status":"200 OK"}}
