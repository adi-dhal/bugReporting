icons are updated when on ENTER_TREE + SETTINGS_CHANGED since the controls are not inside the node tree get_icon would return the wrong / no icon. (not part of gui_base).\r\n\r\nSo in ENTER_TREE the icons (for buttons...) are available and get set. What the user switches to the white theme the icons need to get set again... since the icons color changed. \r\nThis was done in SETTINGS_CHANGED.\r\n\r\nSo a lot of icon update code is duplicated... which sucks... of course.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to move everything int THEME_CHANGED since that is called in enter tree. (from default theme to Gui_base theme) and obviously when the theme gets changed in the settings. that also results in icons only updating when the settings change the theme not for every settings change.\r\n\r\none issue with that approach is `add_style_override` + `add_constant_override`. these functions themselves trigger the THEME_CHANGED notification. as a result there is an endless loop...\r\n\r\nWe could keep those functions in enter tree + settings changed. But that would eliminate the performance increase since the than any settings change would again trigger THEME_CHANGED -> and the icons update...\r\n\r\nthose functions (`add_style_override` + `add_constant_override`) could also have a property to trigger theme_changed or not... but I don't know if that would work than... most style overrides are loaded in draw methods anyways so there it does not matter.\r\n\r\nMaybe there could be THEME_WILL_CHANGE + THEME_CHANGED.\r\nWill change gets called before and changed after...\r\n\r\nI don't know what the best approach is. moving them into THEME_CHAGNED seems like a good idea, but how to handle overrides ?\r\n\r\nping

would be cool if there was a way to have GDNative module source code be part of the project itself, and be recompiled on change and have export templates handle compilation.\r\n\r\nTo support multiple

Or Godot could just support specific language like C or C++. Recompilation of GDNative modules should probably be configured as a user setting rather than a project setting, because a user might not have the tools necessary to compile someone's project.\r\n\r\nIf #11068 is implemented, maybe its implementation could be shared with support for integrating C modules.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11080/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4967","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"A446:572D:1326AFA:2E8E406:59D69A01","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=27>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=25>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"af9e38ae16664cb40afe83a05450c6cd\"","status":"200 OK"}}
