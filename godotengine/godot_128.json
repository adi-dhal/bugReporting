Collider transformations are not updated.\r\nEvery move will only test with the initial Collider position/transformation.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n- Setup a scene with 1 KinematicBody2D (A) and 1 StaticBody2D (B) with rectangular CollisionShape2D\r\n- A is placed left to B (can have some space < 100px) and A and B CollisionSHapes are 64px x 64px\r\n- add a script to A with code:\r\n```\r\nfunc _ready():\r\n\tset_fixed_process(true)\r\n\r\nfunc _fixed_process(delta):\r\n\tmove(Vector2(0, 100))\r\n\tmove(Vector2(100, 0))\r\n\tset_fixed_process(false)\r\n```\r\n\r\nA only moves down, but not to the right.\r\nEven though after moving down, A would fit under B.\r\nIt should be under B and should have moved in an L-shape (first down, then right).\r\nMove does not update Colliders to new position, so while trying to move right, it seems to be blocked by B, as it would be, if we only moved right.\r\n\r\n**Workaround:**\r\nchange _fixed_process to:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc _fixed_process(delta):\r\n\tmove(Vector2(0, 100))\r\n\tvar st = get_shape_transform(0) # get current shape transform, assuming we only have 1 shape\r\n\tst.o += get_travel() # add move translation to shape transform\r\n\tset_shape_transform(0, st) # update shape transform\r\n\tmove(Vector2(100, 0))\r\n        # you should reset the shape transform to its original state befor returing\r\n\tset_fixed_process(false)\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8043","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8043/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8043/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8043/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/8043","id":214576309,"number":8043,"title":"[3.0]

collision shapes in 3D works the same as in 2D, except when it comes to trimesh collisions (aka mesh colliders).\r\n\r\nThe only way I found to produce a collider from a generated Mesh / tool is to call `MeshInstance.create_trimesh_collision()`, which returns nothing, and generates a StaticBody as child of the node, supposedly at last position. If the mesh changes, the node has to be found and `queue_free`d so `create_trimesh_collision` has to be called again to recreate them. It leads to code like this https://github.com/Zylann/godot_terrain_plugin/blob/master/addons/zylann.terrain/terrain_chunk.gd#L12\r\n\r\nWhile it looks easy at first glance, it feel confusing and limited compared to what I was used to in 2D.\r\nInstead of having to forcibly use a helper, I thought I could do something like:\r\n\r\n```gdscript\r\nvar body = StaticBody.new()\r\nvar shape = TrimeshShape.new()\r\nshape.set_mesh(mesh)\r\nbody.set_shape(shape)\r\nparent.add_child(body)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Unity it works the same, by simply assigning a Mesh to a MeshCollider.\r\n\r\nBut there is no TrimeshShape, but Concave and Convex polygon shapes. I understand they mostly are per-case optimized choices, but they are hard to deal with (they also require raw faces instead of a Mesh). Does it mean one or the other are built with the helper too?\r\n\r\nThe main things I don't like is that I'm forced to create a MeshInstance to create a mesh collider, that I'm unable to choose where the nodes go, and that I have to destroy and recreate them if I want to modify the mesh (assuming I can tell them apart).\r\nIt also makes it difficult if you need a high-poly MeshInstance with a low-poly collider.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8041/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8040","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8040/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8040/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8040/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/8040","id":214458242,"number":8040,"title":"Visual Scripting broken on latest builds?","user":{"login":"novemberist","id":7927471,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7927471?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/novemberist","html_url":"https://github.com/novemberist","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novemberist/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novemberist/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novemberist/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novemberist/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novemberist/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novemberist/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novemberist/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novemberist/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novemberist/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279128044,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/confirmed","name":"confirmed","color":"66dd66","default":false},{"id":419752642,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:visualscript","name":"topic:visualscript","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":10,"created_at":"2017-03-15T16:59:37Z","updated_at":"2017-04-27T11:22:17Z","closed_at":"2017-04-27T06:09:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I noticed that having a visual script attached to any node, even if it doesn't contain any complicated logic, will cause the game window to close immediately after running the project without any error messages in the debugger.

This is based off of the work I was doing for both cardboard style VR in iOS and OpenVR. I will be changing my OpenVR project soon to be based off of this. I'll also see if I can split the commit so the camera changes don't get mixed in.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to add support for positional tracking to the core of Godot on top of which an implementation can be build. This allows you, to the restrictions of a platform, to create your Godot game in a way so it can be deployed on different VR platforms. It also has usage outside of VR for tracked controllers such as a PS move style game. \r\n\r\nAs an example I've added code to the iOS implementation that adds an HMD tracker with device orientation. Originally I wanted to base this off of iPhones internal rotationMatrix but I found out that Apple has a bit of a different idea. The code that processes the 9DOF sensor data is simplistic and far from perfect, but it suffices for now. It shouldn't be hard to add the few lines of code to make this available on Android as well. I really need to borrow an Android phone from someone. \r\n\r\nIn GDScript you simply need to place the following somewhere in one of your process handlers:\r\n```gdscript\r\nvar trackers = Input.get_connected_trackers(Input.TRACKER_HMD)\r\nif (!trackers.empty()):\r\n  camera_origin.set_transform(Input.get_tracker_transform(trackers[0]))\r\n```\r\nThe reason get_connected_trackers returns an array is because this is also used for controllers and because tracking could be done by multiple sources. An example of this is NOLO VR which adds positional tracking. You would get orientation from your phone, and tracking from NOLO, while in OpenVR, or from the Oculus SDK it would all be combined.\r\n\r\nAs a result I may add some flags to this as well that communicate whether orientation, position or both are being tracked by a given tracker.\r\n\r\nI will put my test project files online later in the week. \r\n\r\nI can't say much yet about tracking controllers. One departure I'm trying out from my first attempt at implementing OpenVR is that I'm splitting out positional tracking from controllers. A controller will thus appear both as a tracker and a joystick. Until I actually start building this however I can't give too much detail. \r\n\r\nAnyway, looking forward to getting some feedback. Oh and for now Godot 2.1, I'll port this over soon to Godot 3 as well probably after I've gotten some experience with using this for the controller implementation in my OpenVR project.

system or device - Godot version:**\r\nGodot 2.1/HEAD, but it seems like master is somewhat affected too\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nWhile coding some stuff for a (non-FOSS) game, I named one of my methods as `has_point` on a `CanvasItem`-inheriting script that was assigned to some controls. I made it to `return true`, since that was to be overriden by other scripts... And then, suddenly, all the controls with that script started grabbing all clicks :laughing:\r\n\r\nI decided to search the docs, since I suspected something like this might have happened, but `Control::has_point` wasn't listed, since it isn't bound at all.\r\n\r\nNote that the `has_point` implementation on [`scene/gui/control.cpp:572-588`](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/5dbf1809c6e3e905b94b8764e99491e608122261/scene/gui/control.cpp#L572-L588) calls the script method.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n\r\n1. Make a script with:\r\n```gdscript\r\nextends Control\r\nfunc has_point(point):\r\n    return true\r\n```\r\n2. Add it to a Button node\r\n3. Run\r\n4. Profit (or actually, cry)\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:** Partly in a hurry here, so, maybe later on request.\r\n\r\n**How to fix:**\r\n1. Go to [`scene/gui/control.cpp:2516`](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/5dbf1809c6e3e905b94b8764e99491e608122261/scene/gui/control.cpp#L2516)\r\n2. Add a proper `BIND_VMETHOD` macro, like here: [`scene/main/node.cpp:2923`](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/5dbf1809c6e3e905b94b8764e99491e608122261/scene/main/node.cpp#L2923)\r\n```c++\r\nBIND_VMETHOD(MethodInfo(\"_process\", PropertyInfo(Variant::REAL, \"delta\")));\r\n```\r\n3. Compile, make sure that the docs list `Control::has_point(Vector2 point)`\r\n4.
