buttons and links do.\n- The \"Support..\" come from Blender's \"Supported\", but the interface there is different (it actually shows the list, not only when you click). So I proposing this to something like \"Channels\" (which reminds me of  apt) or \"Stability\" (which is not quite what it means, but because of the \"Testing\" that seems to apply).\n- The double-arrow button after Sorting has no tooltip. I suppose it means \"Ascending/Descending\", but the icon doesn't help. Is pressed ascending or descending? Some standard \"AZ\" icon would be better.\n- The pagination numbers are bizarre. What do they mean? What is \"0-0/1\"? Also, they occupy way to much space. Since there's only one item, I'm not sure how the navigation will work.\n- The category in the item is a link. If this link will make the Library go that category, then that'll be okay, but what happens now is that the category changes when you click on the asset.\n- The \"test-hash\" below the category I suppose it's the asset version (though in the asset page it shows an actual version number, so why the hash shows here?). It is also a link.

find it useful to have the tile origins in my tileset at the bottom left corner. In a game in 3/4 view, the point which decides if an object is in front of another is often the one at the bottom of the sprite (if the shapes are simple enough). Since y-sort sorts by the origin of the tiles and other objects, it would be nice to have the possibility to use tiles with the origin at the bottom. This is already doable by using the offset when creating a tileset, but in the TileMap the tiles will then appear above the cursor (if you choose Tile Origin = Top Left).

system or device - Godot version:**\n\nGodot last build\n\n**Issue description**:\n\nFilters in the AnimationTree are somehow conterintuitive, I think that filters can be improved.\nTake for example a Blend2Node. What does it mean to filter some tracks on that node? Are you filtering the animation coming from input A or B?\nI've looked at the code because I can't get the behavior I want in the animation tree, and things seem a bit confsing to me, so... My proposal is:\n\nA filter should be a node in the animation tree on its own. The effect of filteting out a track should be to have that track for every animation sub node to have a weight of zero. For example:\n\n```\nAnim1 <----- +\n             |\nAnim2 <----  Blend3Node <---------- Filter<----- Blend2Node<-----Out\n             |                                       |\nAnim3 <----- +                             Anim4 <---+\n```\n\nIf the Filter is set to filter track x, y and z, then for Anim1, Anim2, and Anim3, these tracks should have a weight of zero in the final blending.\nMultiple filters should accumulate unsing an OR logic. That is a filter can only filter out tracks. Tracks that have been already filtered get no effect.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5261/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5260","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5260/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5260/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5260/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5260","id":160984267,"number":5260,"title":"seed()
