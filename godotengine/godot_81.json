system or device - Godot version:**\r\n- Windows 7 Pro, Service Pack 1\r\n- 64 bits\r\n- Godot_v2.1.3-stable_win64\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nI noticed a problem with the buttons (and scrollbars) and the mouse inputs.\r\nActually, when you hold another mouse button than the left button (so, right button, wheel button, etc), then you press the left click, then you release the other button, and finally you release the left click, the button appears pressed but is not considered as pressed.\r\nSame problem for the scrollbar buttons.\r\n(Note that the problem happens also when you hold two other buttons than the left)\r\nIt's something which happens very rarely (I discovered it by accident), but it can happen with all Godot's buttons (including these in the editor).\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n- Press Right-click with mouse over a button and hold it\r\n- Press Left-click and hold it, with the previous right-click holded.\r\n- Release Right-Click\r\n- Release Left-Click\r\n(It also works with the wheel-click instead of Right-Click)\r\n\r\nThanks

Here is what works at the moment.\r\n\r\n- [x] Rendering. The port uses QOpenGlWindow for accelerated drawing.\r\n- [x] Audio. Reusing the PA driver we already have. Also uses `libaudioresource` to manage permissions.\r\n- [x] Mouse and keyboard input.\r\n- [ ] Touch events are not sent (easy).\r\n- [ ] Landscape mode. Investigating how to implement landscape mode. May need to rotate canvas and translate input.\r\n- [ ] Exporter. SailfishOS uses RPM package format. My idea is to export the project files to a directory with a `.spec` file and call `spectacle` to generate the RPM. This way we will not introduce any additional dependencies like `librpm` nor resort to manually generating the RPM.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9435/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9434","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9434/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9434/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9434/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/9434","id":239256436,"number":9434,"title":"OpenGL fragment and vertex shader error spam [nvidia, Windows]","user":{"login":"Zylann","id":1311555,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1311555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann","html_url":"https://github.com/Zylann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279128044,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/confirmed","name":"confirmed","color":"66dd66","default":false},{"id":205417413,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:windows","name":"platform:windows","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279098111,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:rendering","name":"topic:rendering","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":9,"created_at":"2017-06-28T18:36:57Z","updated_at":"2017-09-08T00:36:05Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Godot master, Windows 10 64 bits\r\nnVidia GeForce 940M\r\n\r\nI got these errors when loading a project and then closing the current scene.
