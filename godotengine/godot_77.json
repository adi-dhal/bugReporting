For Rim it turns out that despite the \"Tint\" adjustment goes up to 1 in maximum, there is no limit to how low the minimum is required. For example: adjust Tint to -100 and you have a blended glowing edge on your object!\r\n\r\nRefraction is simple enough to utilize to get the invisble effect.\r\n\r\nThe idea and main point in this is that the Rim has the potential to be enhanced further so then it can be utilized in maybe creative ways. For example, ghosts or creepy, invisible membrane like object (Sorta like how Metroids have a near invisisble but glowing membrane)\r\n\r\nWhat extras Rim should/could have:\r\n\r\n- Make the Rim colorable, so then it does not use the same white glow,\r\n- An adjustment bar or boolean for the rim glow to be \"emittable\", (Turns out you need a light source or directional light to get the glow, would be awesome if the rim was made emittable without a light source. Better if using an adjustment bar for animation or programming purposes.)\r\n- Make an adjustment bar to adjust the width or visibility of the glowing rim so then typing -100 into the \"tint\" isn't used.\r\n- And allow a boolean option whether different objects with rims appear behind the other invisble/rim objects (As you can see in the example image, the rims does not overlap or merge completely within another object.)\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n\r\nAdd a new mesh to the scene, make a new material:\r\n\r\n-Add a directional light to get the Rim glow.\r\n-Adjust the Albedo's Alpha adjustment bar so then refraction can work,\r\n-Set the Metallic to 0 and the Metallic Specular to 0 to avoid glassy reflections in refraction,\r\n-Set Roughness to 0\r\n-Enable Rim, set rim to \"1\", and type in the tint adjustment: \"-100\", trust me it works despite breaking limitations. (P.S. Unless there is an option to adjust the with of the rim, don't patch it.)\r\n-Enable Refraction, set scale to 0.07. This allows distortion in invisibility\r\n-(OPTIONAL): You can try to use Normalmapping to add details.\r\n\r\nI can already imagine a lot of ghosts/spirits/souls flying around in a game project involving jumpscares, ghost hunting, or etc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9572","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9572/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9572/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9572/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9572","id":241504458,"number":9572,"title":"Fix

jitter when moving. I originally thought it had to do https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2043#issue-85903385\r\n\r\nThe fix is changing your \"fixed_fps\" variable under _physics_ to 144. Once you do that, there is ZERO jitter ANYWHERE. It's all gone\r\n\r\n**The problem is. In godot, there is no way to dynamically **and programmatically** set this before loading the game.**\r\n\r\n- For example, if I ship my game out at a fixed_fps variable of 144. Only players who have a 144hz monitor will get NO JITTER. Anyone with a 60hz monitor wll experience massive jitter.\r\n\r\n- For example #2: If I ship my game out at a fixed_fps at 60 or \"default\" (0), people with a 144hz monitor will experience massive jitter.\r\n\r\nI'm suggesting maybe a method that is available in the `OS` class that grabs the refresh rate of the monitor? Maybe that would help? And then godot developers can just call that before loading an extensive physics game world scene, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9560","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9560/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9560/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9560/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/9560","id":241447769,"number":9560,"title":"[3.0] During Import Process of Assets Engine Crashes","user":{"login":"AnomalyAces","id":10563997,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10563997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnomalyAces","html_url":"https://github.com/AnomalyAces","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnomalyAces/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnomalyAces/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnomalyAces/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnomalyAces/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnomalyAces/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnomalyAces/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnomalyAces/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnomalyAces/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnomalyAces/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-07-08T12:36:15Z","updated_at":"2017-07-27T14:25:07Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\r\nWindows 10\r\nGodot 3.0\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\n<!-- What happened, and what was expected. -->\r\nWhen the engine starts it tries to auto import resources.
