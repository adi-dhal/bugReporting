It is actually simpler to do so than to do that on the CPU and there is no need to transfer the new 3D texture each time something changes. This would allow for the texture to be updated each frame reflecting the changes in the scene. This has few advantages:\r\n\r\n- Not only changing light sources but also moving objects will cast shadows and reflections consistently and without latency.\r\n- It will allow to only voxelize a section of the scene around the camera, so there will be no need of a huge 3d texture for big scenes (Multiple layers of voxelization could be used, thus having a smaller cube around the camera where the detailed voxelization happen and a bigger one with a more coarse voxelization)\r\n- It will run faster even in the editor.\r\n\r\nHere is a paper on voxelization. It's based on DIrectx but GLES3 supports all the required functionalities:\r\nhttps://developer.nvidia.com/content/basics-gpu-voxelization\r\n(as you can see from the paper the algorithm is really simple)\r\n\r\nHere is a 3D engine that uses this

Jump a lot (Z or up arrow to jump)\r\n2. You'll eventually fall through the platform\r\n3. It could take up to a few dozen or so jumps for it to happen, or you might get lucky and fall through after three or so.\r\n\r\nFor the `is_on_floor()` issue:\r\n1. Head left towards the first wall you encounter\r\n2. While holding left arrow against the wall, attempt to jump to the platform right above you\r\n3. The player should get stuck there until left arrow is released. This is due to my code setting vertical velocity to something very low when on the floor.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11357/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11356","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11356/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11356/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11356/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/11356","id":258299362,"number":11356,"title":"Fixed
