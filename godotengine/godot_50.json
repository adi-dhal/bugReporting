When more time has passed than _fixed_process() can process (because _fixed_process() can only simulate physics in fixed step intervals), the sprite is drawn where it was at the end of the last physics update rather than where it currently is. The 'accumulated leftover', or difference between the last physics update and the current time will keep getting larger as the loops get further out of sync, until finally the 'leftover' gets greater than 1/60 and some of it can be processed by the physics engine. When this happens, the sprite will 'jump' to a more precise location.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon is the same one that is described in the \"The final touch\" section of this article: https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/#the-final-touch\r\nThe author proposes using interpolation to draw the sprite at a position between its position at the end of the most recent physics update and the physics update before that--I think that's a reasonable approach, but it seems like then your character would always be 'behind'.\r\n\r\nMy preferred solution would be, when rendering sprites, to 'extrapolate' their position at the time of drawing by starting with what their position was at the end of the last _fixed_process() and then calculating their projected position using their last known velocity. How exactly to extrapolate the position of some sprite is subjective (what if the sprite has an acceleration, etc.) so it might make sense to have the extrapolation be implemented by the user in GDScript.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nPlay the example project with a 60hz refresh rate monitor so the game runs at 60 FPS. The 'leftover delta'  that has accumulated will be printed: notice that, when it finally accumulates to ~0.16 (1/60), it will 'roll over' and an extra physics update will be performed for that frame, causing the position of the sprite to suddenly be corrected and appear as an ugly jump.\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example

At this point however we can not pass the emited string variable from the signal without creating a script and attach it to the edit box. We are forced to create a script and attach it - for such a simple thing with very few lines of code.\r\n\r\nHere comes my feature request - for the connecting signal gui in godot's editor:\r\n1.Please add the ability to feed emited signal variables values to methods in nodes that the user sets to receive\r\n2.Please add the ability to receive emited signal variable values \r\nLike this:\r\n![signalsrequest](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6495061/29388089-31cc3eb8-82db-11e7-93dc-b15de318e78a.PNG)\r\n\r\nbtw when I try this,I get the following error:\r\n![signaltryerror](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6495061/29388663-e61aabbe-82dd-11e7-89a2-737e1ad6d7d3.PNG)\r\n\r\nWe can do that stuff in gdscript and it is fairly well documented. My request is to also be able to do it in the connection editor.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10384/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10383","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10383/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10383/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10383/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10383","id":250756914,"number":10383,"title":"Fix particles emitting when emitting is set to false in scene","user":{"login":"bojidar-bg","id":5276727,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5276727?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg","html_url":"https://github.com/bojidar-bg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-08-16T20:54:28Z","updated_at":"2017-08-17T08:52:36Z","closed_at":"2017-08-17T08:52:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/10383","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10383","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10383.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10383.patch"},"body":"Caused by #10297 calling `particles_restart()` on the same frame as the one `set_emitting(false)` is called.\r\nThe rasterizer would then wait a frame, and then set emitting back to true.\r\n\r\nJust in case, I tested with all 4 emitting/one_shot configurations: `emitting=false,one_shot=false`, `emitting=false,one_shot=true`, `emitting=true,one_shot=false`, and `emitting=true,one_shot=true`.

(I hate that solution)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis implements everything needed for a light theme.\r\n - there are new icons for dark and light, both hi and low dpi\r\n - the svgs to png script now colors the pngs and exports them to different folders for dark and light icons.\r\n - the SCsub file is is updated so that `editor_icons.gen.cpp` uses has all dark and light icons.\r\n - `editor_icons.gen.cpp` now takes an argument for the icon color which should get registered in the `editor_register_icons(Ref<Theme> p_theme, bool light_icons)` function.\r\n - when the theme loads it checks for the base_color and if it is light, it loads the correct icons and the correct font color.\r\n - added **Light** theme as one of the theme presets.\r\n - I also simplified some colours. By that process  I removed tab highlighting, because it was duplicate logic for the light theme.

I opened this issue to discuss what and how the changes should be implemented.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of what could be added:\r\n\r\n**Control nodes**\r\n- [x] Display the margin values when moving a node (#10437), \r\n- [x] Display width and height values when resizing a node (#10437),\r\n- [x] When moving anchors, draw a rectangle to show the selected node without rotation/scaling (#10437),\r\n- [x] Hide anchors helpers if child of a container (#10437),\r\n- [x] Add a menu option to hide the helpers (#10437).\r\n\r\n**Grid and guides**\r\n- [x] Implement top and left rulers (#10437)\r\n- [x] ~~Implement a smart grid that align with the rulers, thus depending on the zoom level~~ the rulers adapts to the grid instead (#10437)\r\n- [x] Smart snapping: snap anchors / nodes to the grid / guides / align with other nodes, etc... (suggested by reduz) (#10437)\r\n- [ ] Implement guides\r\n- [ ] Display the grid behind the selected node, but above the selected node's parents. (This seems really hard to implement :/)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Other**\r\n- [x] Move \"zoom in\"/\"zoom out\"/\"Reset zoom\" out of the view menu (#10437),\r\n- [x] Remove \"Set zoom\", it's pretty useless don't you think ? (#10437),\r\n- [x]  Fusion lock+unlock and selectable children/not selectable children (#10437),\r\n- [ ] Snap rotation (and scale ?)\r\n- [ ] Add a configurable key to zoom by moving the mouse.\r\n- [ ] Add a local/global button that could:\r\n   - rotate the view to align with the selected node (or its parent)\r\n   - display the grid relative to the node,\r\n   - If it is implemented, make the smart grid/rulers display relative values instead of absolute ?\r\n- [ ] Blender-like selection: first click selects the topmost node, other the one under and so on. _(implementation reminder to myself: keep a list of the control nodes under mouse when clicking somewhere. If the list changes when we click somewhere else, we select the node on the top, else, we take the following node in the list)_\r\n\r\n**Keyboard controls**\r\n- [x] Toogle grid snapping (#10437),\r\n- [x] Toogle grid visibility (#10437),\r\n- [x] Multiply/divide the grid size by 2 (#10437),\r\n- [x] Use the shift key to restraint anchor dragging to a single axis (#10437), \r\n- [ ] Toogle snapping temporarily (ctrl key when dragging)\r\n- [ ] Make all keys as editable shortcuts (will be difficult, unless we find a way to fix #10497)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10375/reactions","total_count":27,"+1":21,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":6}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10374","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10374/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10374/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10374/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/10374","id":250593218,"number":10374,"title":"Control anchor positioning is sometimes wrong","user":{"login":"kubecz3k","id":6129594,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6129594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k","html_url":"https://github.com/kubecz3k","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-08-16T11:25:02Z","updated_at":"2017-08-16T11:34:49Z","closed_at":"2017-08-16T11:34:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\r\nLinux, 1ecb48b8c275f8c895ed34ac7e267871859daf1e\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nIn this versions some UI controls are sometimes shifted out of their original places.\r\n\r\n_pic1, good:_\r\n![ui_pos_good](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6129594/29360975-b2661716-8285-11e7-8a48-7614f8c7173b.png)\r\n\r\n_pic2:bad (the same scene)_\r\n![ui_pos_bad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6129594/29360984-c01db60c-8285-11e7-9088-bb6b7fd629ce.png)\r\n\r\nI assume the pr that introduces this behavior is https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9889\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n1.
