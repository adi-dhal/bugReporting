driver 385.69,  \r\n\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nDisplay scaling via Viewport and 2D doesn't work correctly on game when the game is fullscreen (only when it is fullscreen) AND Windows Display Settings Scale is different than 100% (which is very common today for them to be set greater than 100%). The behavior works correctly on Linux and OSX. I even adjusted scaling on OSX and behavior is good, but on Windows the scale is incorrect. In debugging the problem I found that if I print the screen size and the viewport size, they match in all of the working cases. However, in the fullscreen Windows Display Scale > 100% case, the viewport is the native resolution of the screen (1920x1080), but the screen may be something smaller due to scaling. I suspect the viewport is not getting set correctly when Windows Display Scale is > 100% and the game is fullscreen. However the screen size is getting set correctly. Toggling the HIDPI settings doesn't make a difference either.\r\n\r\nHopefully I explained this well enough. I know the user can right-click the application and set properties > compatibility > ignore scaling as an option, but they shouldn't have to do this. I supplied a sample project (ScalingExample) and a video demonstrating the behavior (errordemo)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I will try to adjust the viewport manually on startup.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n**_Demonstrate fullscreen without display scaling works correctly_**\r\nIn Windows 10 set your project settings as follows:\r\n- Fullscreen (true)\r\n- Stretch Mode (2d or viewport - I used 2d for the example)\r\n- Stretch Aspect (keep - I've also tried the others)\r\nRun the application\r\nThe game should render correctly\r\nStop the game\r\n\r\n**_Demonstrate no fullscreen and resizing works correctly_**\r\nOpen Windows Display Settings and make sure \"Scale and Layout\" is set to 100%.\r\nChange Project Settings > Fullscreen > False\r\nRun the application \r\nResize your window, the application should render correctly at the correct scale.\r\nStop the game\r\n\r\n**_Demonstrate no fullscreen and resizing with Desktop Display Scaling works correctly_**\r\nOpen Windows Display Settings and make sure \"Scale and Layout\" is > 100%\r\nMake sure Project Settings > Fullscreen > False\r\nRun the application\r\nRun the application and resize the window\r\nThe application should render correctly.\r\nStop the game\r\n\r\n**_Demonstrate Error Condition - fullscreen with Desktop Display Scaling renders incorrectly_**\r\nOpen Windows Display Settings and make sure \"Scale and Layout\" is > 100%\r\nChange Project Settings > Fullscreen > True\r\nRun the application\r\nThe graphics will be scaled much larger than they should be and may be off screen\r\nStop the game\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example

Since the scene importer plugin also returns .obj as an accepted file type, this is the importer that ends up being used instead of the OBJ importer. I'm guessing it's finding the scene importer and accepting it before it comes across the OBJ importer, so it might be a matter of re-ordering the list of importers. \r\n\r\nI commented out the following on line 4639 of editor_node.cpp:\r\n\r\n`Ref<EditorOBJImporter> import_obj;`\r\n`import_obj.instance();`\r\n`import_scene->add_importer(import_obj);`\r\n\r\nand it solved the problem for me, although I doubt this is the correct way to do it since the scene importer probably still needs to be able to handle obj stuff. I did try re-ordering the importers, but it didn't seem to make any difference, which surprised me.

instead.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11746","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11746/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11746/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11746/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/11746","id":261918457,"number":11746,"title":"Add

should be an equivalent of get_tree()'s \"idle_frame\" for the AnimationPlayer (or AnimationTreePlayer?), just when it has finished the update for the current frame. This would make it possible to override animation transformations during coroutines. At the moment, we can resume execution at what I assume is the start of each frame (idle_frame), but not the end. So an alternative to adding the signal to AnimationPlayer, could be to add a signal for when all objects have updated, something like \"idle_frame_post\".\r\n\r\nProblem example:\r\n```\r\nfunc _start_cursor_aim_routine():\r\n    var timer = 0\r\n    var duration = 1\r\n    var start_angle = some_obj.rotation_deg\r\n    while timer < duration:\r\n        var end_angle =

    [animation updates after each time this function resumes, thus overriding everything we do here :( ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo work around it using booleans and _process() is a huge hassle, as it required me to create at least 8 class variables compared to only local
