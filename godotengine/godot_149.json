This thread is for discussing the possibility of changing the Import/Export system in Godot 3.0.\r\n\r\nCurrent one works by having two separate import and export systems. It works, but it's complex for a lot of users, as you generally need to have a separate directory for stuff you want to import, and also separate options for the stuff you want to export.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the code is difficult to maintain, generally buggy, and not that user friendly.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to move to a system more similar to how Unity works, where you just copy your assets like .dae , .wav, .png, to the project directory.. then Godot does a forced import of the assets, yet your code can keep referencing those files as if they were native.  At export Godot will just export it's native assets and replace internally.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing a lot of people working with Unity this way, I really think it's difficult to deny that it's more user friendly. It will also make the import/export process and code _much_ simpler.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7408/reactions","total_count":18,"+1":16,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7407","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7407/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7407/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7407/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/7407","id":198278600,"number":7407,"title":"[Suggestion]

There are two scenes (Levels) and I change them in my main screen scene by removing the last scene from the node2d and loading, adding new scene from next level.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nCreate scene with Node2D as the first node with name \"World\" and then create light in it. After that create another scene with Node and attach a script to this node and create node2d in it with name \"Level\". In the script, if the \"Level\" has the \"World\" node then get_node(\"Level/World\").queue_free() and load the \"World\" from another scene.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7404","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7404/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7404/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7404/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/7404","id":198247061,"number":7404,"title":"Feature request : Ability to select instanced scenes from the viewport.","user":{"login":"vonflyhighace2","id":5633261,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5633261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vonflyhighace2","html_url":"https://github.com/vonflyhighace2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vonflyhighace2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vonflyhighace2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vonflyhighace2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vonflyhighace2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vonflyhighace2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vonflyhighace2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vonflyhighace2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vonflyhighace2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vonflyhighace2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-12-31T21:17:14Z","updated_at":"2017-01-02T13:52:37Z","closed_at":"2017-01-02T13:52:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device -

When set to 'hugging' it would change \r\n`def my_func ( stuff )` to `def my_func(stuff)` when requested through a keyboard shortcut.\r\n\r\nThings to consider:\r\n- parenthesis hugging for function parameters, function calls, etc. (separate options)\r\n- spacing for lists (1,2,3) vs (1, 2, 3)\r\n- line wrapping\r\n- variable naming (case) snake_case CamelCase etc.\r\n- hash formatting (multiple lines?)\r\n\r\nQuestion I have are: would this be interesting for upstream, if so should I write it in gdscript or make changes to the editor?
