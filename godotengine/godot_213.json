Godot version:**\nXubuntu 16.04 64b - Godot Engine V2.1 alpha custom_build (latest from today 06/29/16)\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nThe MeshLibrary I created for my GridMap contains one tile with a navmesh but the cells in the Gridmap don't join together. When I try to calculate a path, no path was found when the end point is in another cell than the start point. Within the same cell, the path is found.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n1. Download the blend file from the link\n2. Export it as better collada (last git version). Lights are not needed.\n3. Import it in a godot project. (animation not needed)\n4. Convert the scene to a MeshLibrary\n5. Create a scene with a Navigation node and a child node GridMap using the MeshLibrary. Draw some path. \n6. Add a script that calculates a path:\n   `\n   \n   ```\n   extends Spatial\n   \n   func _update_path():\n      var nav=get_node(\"nav\") # navigation node\n      var begin=Vector3(0.5,0.5,0.5) #start point\n      var end=Vector3(10,0.5,0.5) # end point\n   \n      var p = nav.get_simple_path(begin,end,true)\n      print(p) # should not be empty when a path is found. \n   \n   func _ready():\n      _update_path()\n   ```\n\n`\n\nIf the begin and end point are within the same cell, the path is found. But not when they go across two or more cells. Therefore the join of the navmesh didn't occure.\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\nLink to blend

By now I'm keeping separate commits to keep my work clearer to follow step by step as this is an intrincate topic.\n\nMotivated by [this commit and comment](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/29177e1e9b2644cfa2d5efe6fcfe2605b84ed68c) I decided to have a look. Done the folliowing:\n- Reverted reduz's commit.\n- Homogenizied loaders/savers because classes for text formats were confusingly named and stored in directories as if they were only for scenes, when they are for resources as well. Special treatment was misleading.\n- Removed pointless code that skipped  **.res** extension and then added it expicitly.\n- Removed a left-over commented line of code that will never be needed.\n- Switched the order in which types are registered so that all text formats are registered before all binary formats. **As a consequence save dialogs will prefer text formats in every case (scenes & resources)** as they pick the first extension in the list for the proposed file name. I think saving resources in text is also desired for the same reasons as scenes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5467/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4780","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"C33A:572D:13402AB:2ECA5B2:59D69D0E","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=214>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=212>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"c6b98306b29488fbc537f1360dd8717d\"","status":"200 OK"}}
