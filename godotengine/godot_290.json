There could be 2 kind of links soft and hard one (or some checkbox). \nBasically after adding link node to the scene you could define node to which they are linked to.\nFrom this moment you could thread link as this linked target node (exactly just like it would be added instead of the link in this place, so you could call functions, add new nodes, remove child etc).\n\nDifference between hard and soft links:\n**Hard Link:** If you will use hard link and you will remove original node from the game it would still be accessible via hard link (probably should simply replace one of hard links)\n**Soft Link:** If you remove original node from the game it's no longer accessible via soft links (not sure what exactly should happen, remove all soft links as well? Should be some way to change 'target' node for soft link in this situation instead (probably with signal)). \n\nIn this comment I'm telling about use case where this can be helpful:

been experiencing some serious weirdness since rebuilding godot.  I last built it a week ago and everything was fine.  I am on arch linux if that matters.\n\nGodot starts with these errors but does not crash.  I don't know if they are related or not:\n\n```\nERROR: get_edited_scene_root: Index current_edited_scene out of size (edited_scene.size()).\n   At: tools/editor/editor_data.cpp:598.\nERROR: get_edited_scene_root: Index current_edited_scene out of size (edited_scene.size()).\n   At: tools/editor/editor_data.cpp:598.\nERROR: add_child: Can't add child, already has a parent\n   At: scene/main/node.cpp:740.\nERROR: add_child: Can't add child, already has a parent\n   At: scene/main/node.cpp:740.\nbind toptions\nERROR: get_edited_scene_root: Index current_edited_scene out of size (edited_scene.size()).\n   At: tools/editor/editor_data.cpp:598.\nERROR: grab_focus: Condition ' !is_inside_tree() ' is true.\n   At: scene/gui/control.cpp:2223.\nERROR: grab_focus: Condition ' !is_inside_tree() ' is true.\n   At: scene/gui/control.cpp:2223.\n```\n\nWhen I try to open my main scene (which is pretty big and has many references to other scenes) godot crashes with the following error:\n\n```\nERROR: set_current_tab: Index p_current out of size (get_tab_count()).\n   At: scene/gui/tabs.cpp:625.\n```\n\nBut it gets weirder.  When I opened my scripts folder in the filesystem tab, godot crashed (with the same \"Index p_current out of size\" error).  Opening other folders worked fine, but it crashed without fail when I opened the scripts folder.  However, I removed the contents of the scripts folder, then slowly added them back in (refreshing the filesystem tab as I went).  Throughout the process godot never crashed.  And it no longer crashed when I open the scripts folder.  This \"fix\" persisted even when I reopened godot.\n\nWeird right?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3170","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3170/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3170/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3170/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3170","id":124286728,"number":3170,"title":"added missing onready allocation for subclasses","user":{"login":"leezh","id":185322,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/185322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezh","html_url":"https://github.com/leezh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/1/labels","id":1381437,"number":1,"title":"2.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":444,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-10-28T13:37:45Z","updated_at":"2017-07-28T10:44:22Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2017-07-28T10:44:22Z"},"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-12-30T00:33:50Z","updated_at":"2015-12-30T13:55:50Z","closed_at":"2015-12-30T08:35:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/3170","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3170","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3170.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3170.patch"},"body":"Fixes https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/3158\n\nThe problem was with https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/30c12297dc6df7d35df140475c0cec7308aea77a.
