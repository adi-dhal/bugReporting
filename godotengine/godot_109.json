system or device - Godot version:**\r\nMac OS X 10.11.6, Windows 10\r\nGodot version v2.1.3.stable.offical\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nWhen updating a scene outside the Godot instance, it is overwritten without any warnings / messages etc.\r\n\r\nThis means that in practice - you have to close down a scene before doing things like for example git sync. One could discuss the practice of editing the same scene at once, but a least a warning or an indicator or similar would have been beneficial. Other parts of Godot handle automatic reloading and many editors warn you about file changes outside the disk. We discovered this during LD and it became hard to  patch stuff up.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n1. Start an empty project\r\n2. Add a root node of any type\r\n3. Add 2 children of the root node of any type\r\n4. Save the instance as .tscn\r\n5. In another Godot instance or a plain text editor, remove the second child and save the file\r\n6. Return to the first Godot instance and Run the scene \r\n7. If you inspect the .tscn, you see that the second child has returned (like a creepy horror movie)\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\nNot needed","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8615/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8614","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8614/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8614/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8614/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/8614","id":225483781,"number":8614,"title":"Pack Mode: Pack into archive file (*.zip) --> Add support for password protection?","user":{"login":"supercom32","id":27777553,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/27777553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/supercom32","html_url":"https://github.com/supercom32","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supercom32/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supercom32/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supercom32/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supercom32/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supercom32/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supercom32/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supercom32/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supercom32/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supercom32/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":24,"created_at":"2017-05-01T17:54:19Z","updated_at":"2017-05-03T11:43:07Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi Everyone,\r\n\r\nI noted that in the \"Pack Mode\" options for exporting a project, you can choose \"Pack into archive file (.zip)\" as one of the targets.

When I run this script, only the first node is created, not the second node.\r\n**EDIT:** after looking at other examples like tilesethelper, I found out that this doesn't work because `Node.set_owner` is shallow and doesn't account for an ownership hierarchy.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n1. Create a Node, which I will call `test` for reference.\r\n2. Add the following script to it:\r\n```\r\ntool\r\nextends Node\r\n\r\nexport(bool) var reset = false setget _on_reset\r\n\r\nfunc _on_reset(value):\r\n\tif (value):\r\n\t\treset = false\r\n\t\tfor child in get_children():\r\n\t\t\tchild.free()\r\n\t\tvar new_node = Node.new()\r\n\t\tadd_child(new_node)\r\n\t\tnew_node.set_owner(self)\r\n\t\tnew_node.set_name(\"new_node\")\r\n\t\tvar new_sprite = Sprite.new()\r\n\t\tnew_node.add_child(new_sprite)\r\n\t\tnew_sprite.set_owner(new_node)\r\n\t\tnew_sprite.set_name(\"new_sprite\")\r\n\t\tnew_sprite.set_texture(preload(\"res://icon.png\")) # or whatever image you want\r\n```\r\n3. Click the `Reset` checkbox to run the script. In the scene tree you can see that `new_node` was created but it doesn't have a child called `new_sprite`. However, in the editor viewport (not when playing the scene), the sprite is being drawn on the screen!\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\n<!-- Optional but very welcome.
