rename/delete/copy it.\r\netc...\r\n\r\nAn other benefit would be that creating directories, renaming and moving files outside of Godot does loose dependencies  but in Godot we might be able to do all that with additional look ups.\r\n\r\nWhen working on a large project I often find myself wanting to sort my files differently or move things from growing directories to keep things dry for the eyes and organized.\r\nThese changes would allow large projects to be easily managed all from the Godot engine without having to open an explorer window, 3rd party editor or terminal
