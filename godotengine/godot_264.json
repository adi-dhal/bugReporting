What?\n\nHello guys, so I decided I will try to implement the editor shortcuts. I know that there's a card for that in the [Trello Roadmap board](https://trello.com/c/9eX7KPGy), which kind of makes me think that this is only for the official devs to implement. Is it? If it is, I won't waste time trying, but if it isn't (anyone can implement it), it is currently a lot of fun for me to work on Godot, so I'll do my best.\n### How I plan to do it\n\nSo I have read the code on how it works in the `Project Settings / Input Map`, how the `InputMap` class works, how `DefaultInput` works, how controls currently receive keyboard events and how this is all set up in the editor. I also now understand that the input map is currently stored in `Global` and saved to engine.cfg. Now as far as I understand it, `EditorSettings` is used to store, well, editor settings.\n\nSo my plan is to refactor the existing input map to a separate control, make it work not just with `Global` but also with `EditorSettings` (to store the shortcuts there), then make controls also accept action names for shortcuts (accelerators in code) and respond to them. So this would create a new tab in the editor settings, Shortcuts, which would work the same as Input Map in project settings. Controls would also accept action names (and draw the first assigned key).\n\nThis could ease up the creation of new editor shortcuts and potentially let the user set up their own actions and assign them to various buttons and menus in the editor.\n### Checklist\n- [x] Refactor `ProjectSettings`'s Input Map tab into a separate class\n- [x] Make it work with `Global` and `EditorSettings`\n- [x] Add the shortcuts tab to editor settings\n- [ ] Make controls, menus and buttons accept action name as an accelerator (shortcut)\n- [ ] Make controls draw the first assigned key to action\n- [ ] Test\n- [ ] Profit\n- [ ] ???\n### The question\n\nShould I work on this? Or let someone else handle this? For now I'll assume that my effort won't be wasted and work on this.\n\n_Note: Don't merge this PR yet... Work in progress..._\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3952/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3951","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3951/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3951/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3951/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3951","id":138795430,"number":3951,"title":"Fix

Even when I released `Ctrl+S`, the multiple appearing of save dialog will not stop (it stopped at a certain time after the release).

I was expecting also that when I released `Ctrl+S`, the appearing of multiple save dialog will stop.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n1. Create a new project\n2.

insist me to use an allowed extension name from the save dialog list (SCN, XML, etc.) The expected result was to be able to save the POT file.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nGo to menu:\n\nScene -> Convert to -> Translatable strings\nClick on save button\nThe error mesage dialog appears\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\nAny scene with a root node would work\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3938/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3937","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3937/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3937/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3937/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/3937","id":138716302,"number":3937,"title":"Godot

we can see here https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/core/math/math_funcs.cpp#L88 Godot uses broken way of generating random double:\n\n```\n(double)rand() / (double)RANDOM_MAX;\n```\n\nwhich does not give us uniform distribution.\n\nBad news is that gcc/clang ( and probably MSVC ) also don't have perfect double genrators :disappointed:  ( with C++11 uniform_real_distribution )\n\nOn the upside - there are some libraries that try to give ~good pseudo-random doubles ( eg. https://github.com/art4711/random-double
