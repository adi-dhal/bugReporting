The Blender [Internal Engine has been discontinued (per Blender devs)](https://twitter.com/dingto/status/268655993020350464) as of 2010, and is only included for backward compatibility - for now.\r\n\r\n### Main issue:\r\nThe Better Collada exporter for Blender does not export textures or even basic colors when using **Blender Cycles**.  _Blender Internal engine support and development has ended._\r\n\r\n\r\n**Issue description** When exporting from Blender, using Cycles, all textures, colors, etc. are lost and must be manually copied to Godot, and manually set on each mesh. This becomes overwhelming to support for the Godot user when dozens (or more) textures and colors are needed in a game.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Proposed solution:**  Cycles, a node and tree based system like Godot, needs be supported - at minimum, Cycles' textures should be supported/exported.\r\n\r\n**Attached** is a very tiny and very simple blender file containing a cube with one texture that is packed in the the Blender file. Using the Better Collada exporter, and checking the \"copy textures\" flag in the exporter results in a Godot Scene import with no texture at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Blender_Cycles_to

new drag and drop function is awesome, but a thing that can get really annoying really fast is that if you drop Node1 below Node2, which has subnodes, it automatically makes Node1 a child of Node2. That means that when you have a bunch of nodes with subnodes and you want to order them, you either don't use drag and drop or do a complicated tetris game moving the nodes with subnodes first, then the normal nodes, and repeat until you get it just right. \r\nThe normal would be that when you put Node1 above Node2 it would go above, when you put Node1 over Node2 it should make Node1 a child of Node2, and when putting Node1 under Node2, it should go under.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7076","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7076/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7076/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7076/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/7076","id":188061562,"number":7076,"title":"Modulate for UI nodes","user":{"login":"mateusak","id":18586380,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/18586380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateusak","html_url":"https://github.com/mateusak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateusak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateusak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateusak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateusak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateusak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateusak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateusak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateusak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateusak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279097162,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/discussion","name":"discussion","color":"ee77ee","default":false},{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279098111,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:rendering","name":"topic:rendering","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-11-08T18:01:05Z","updated_at":"2016-11-09T06:51:23Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Some of the nodes which should have modulate doesn't even offer you an option to the change color or if it does it's a lengthy process.
