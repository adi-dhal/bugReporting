is a problem with a response time to touch input. \nHere's a simple code:\n\n```\nfunc _input(event):\n    if event.type == InputEvent.SCREEN_DRAG:\n         set_pos(event.pos)\n```\n\nThis script is attached to a sprite node. All it should do is simply place the node exactly where the touch event is happening, however there's a delay- when quickly moving finger across the screen it almost feel like there's this code happening:\n\n```\nset_pos(get_pos().linear_interpolate(event.pos, n*delta))\n```\n\nOn tablet it is possible to get ~3-4cm distance between the positions of a finger and a sprite. \n\nI'll admit that the devices I'm using for testing are quite old: Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 and LG Nexus 4, however I tested other demo performance made with Unity on same devices and I couldn't spot similar issue, that's why I think this is the engines
