everyone! I've been enjoying Godot and am very impressed and loving it. Thanks to all those putting their hard work into it. I searched through the issues and it seems no-one's requested this in particular. I hope so, anyway!\n\nSo, onto the problem/feature request: it seems certain nodes (I think it's node2d and everything that inherits it that has no specific size attribute -- kinematic body, area2d, etc.) have a default select-area size of 64x64 px in the editor. This is the area that you can select objects in the editor, and it seems there's no way to change this size.\n\n![select_area](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18315399/14334423/0197eaa6-fc1a-11e5-9f0f-9ca1ff5690ae.png)\n\n(The player root node shown above is a kinematic body, but again, it seems it's many nodes with this default, non-change-able size) As you can see above, in a low resolution game where every object is based on 16x16 tile-size, this makes selecting and arranging objects in the editor difficult (though the drop-down select tool helps). It would be super helpful to be able to set these node select-areas to something that fits the game you're making -- 16x16 in this case.\n\n**The feature**, then: would it be possible to add a field in project settings marked, maybe, \"set default node select size\", and you could set a width/height there? That way if you're working on a game based around 16x16 tile-size you could type that in, and all of these kinds of nodes would have that size, allowing you to move and select and align things with no problem. Or maybe even just a way to set this kind of thing on a node-by-node basis, though I think just having a default you could set would be helpful enough!\n\nThanks again in advance, and I hope I'm doing this right.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4255/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4254","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4254/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4254/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4254/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4254","id":146426106,"number":4254,"title":"Testing game from 2nd monitor crash","user":{"login":"kirilledelman","id":6539713,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6539713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirilledelman","html_url":"https://github.com/kirilledelman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirilledelman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirilledelman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirilledelman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirilledelman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirilledelman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirilledelman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirilledelman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirilledelman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirilledelman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097780,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:osx","name":"platform:osx","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-04-06T20:35:23Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T14:21:17Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I have a 3 monitor setup on my iMac:\niMac itself, Cintiq, and another monitor.\nWhen I start the Godot editor, and drag the window to a different monitor, then press Play icon on top to test my game, the game crashes immediately:\n\n```\nException Type:        EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)\nException Codes:       KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x0000000063614d2f\n```\n\nIf I drag the editor window back to the first monitor, and launch the game -

It's just what I'm used to after many years of using VS. This is **unlike** VS Code (for example) where the caret position goes into 'virtual' space, such that when you stop scrolling, the view 'jumps' to the location in the code where the caret ended up. To me this is annoying behaviour that removes some of the usefulness of the feature. Android Studio (and I guess by extension IntelliJ IDEA) behaves like VS Code.

Directly save the scene as *.tscn\r\n\r\nThe output tscn is ~15 Mb. \r\nGodot seems to export the content of the depth.png image which path is provided as a parameter to the \"bg\" node, instead of the provided path.\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\r\nhttps://github.com/StraToN/godot_pointandclickadv/releases/tag/v0.1\r\n\r\n**Details**\r\nThe corresponding exported image is located in the Assets/terrain.gd script.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4240/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4239","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4239/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4239/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4239/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4239","id":146042692,"number":4239,"title":"Adding \"Quick open\" for scenes and scripts","user":{"login":"Zylann","id":1311555,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1311555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann","html_url":"https://github.com/Zylann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-04-05T16:34:31Z","updated_at":"2016-04-05T16:45:21Z","closed_at":"2016-04-05T16:45:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As my game project grows in size, I found myself navigating too often in files to open what I'm searching for.
