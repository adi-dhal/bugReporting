This method doesn't use member variables, but anyway it crashes on GCC 6. I think calling a method when pointer is `0x0` especially for casting from `this` is not a good idea, because the behavior is undefined - in most cases it works properly, but - as You can see - not always (e.g. GCC 6 or probably other special cases).\n\nGodot crashes somewhere inside C++ library `__cxxabiv1::__dynamic_cast` (the `rdi` register - which is first function argument treated as a pointer - is 0x0, so it must crash):\n\n``` assembly\n        50 [1]  in /build/gcc-multilib/src/gcc/libstdc++-v3/libsupc++/dyncast.cc\n0x7f42c08e89d0  <+0x0020>        48 8b 07                    mov    rax,QWORD PTR [rdi]\n```\n\nWhen compiling with `-O0` optimization the it works fine - it doesn't call the `__cxxabiv1::__dynamic_cast` function and it returns `NULL` immediately. The `__cxxabiv1::__dynamic_cast` function mustn't be called with `NULL` argument.\nIt is difficult to debug it on `-Og` level due to optimizations (can't debug on `-O0`, because it works properly), but when I reading the assembly code, it looks for me like GCC 6 does an optimization: it doesn't check the `this` argument before calling the `dynamic_cast`, because it expects that `this` will never be `NULL`.\n\nThis patch fixes the issue:\n\n``` diff\ndiff --git a/tools/editor/plugins/canvas_item_editor_plugin.cpp b/tools/editor/plugins/canvas_item_editor_plugin.cpp\nindex 0213dbd..7f045e9 100644\n--- a/tools/editor/plugins/canvas_item_editor_plugin.cpp\n+++ b/tools/editor/plugins/canvas_item_editor_plugin.cpp\n@@ -1492,7 +1492,7 @@ void CanvasItemEditor::_viewport_input_event(const InputEvent& p_event) {\n        while ((n && n != scene && n->get_owner() != scene) || (n && !n->is_type(\"CanvasItem\"))) {\n            n = n->get_parent();\n        };\n-       c = n->cast_to<CanvasItem>();\n+       c = n ? n->cast_to<CanvasItem>() : 0;\n #if 0\n        if ( b.pressed ) box_selection_start( click );\n #endif\n```\n\nThe alternative is to check whether `this` isn't `NULL` before calling the `dynamic_cast` inside `Object::cast_to<>()` method.\n\nMaybe some other crashes caused by GCC 6 are also related to this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4673/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4672","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4672/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4672/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4672/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4672","id":155027740,"number":4672,"title":"Make

usually auto-updated other external ressources like textures etc.\n\nAnd if you press the little \"refresh\" button at the left of the script variable into the inspector, it clears the image isntead

64bit, tested with Godot 2.0.3 and 2.0.2\n\nScaling big CollisionShape2D's (or setting big shape sizes) hangs up the editor.\nTested with CircleShape2D and RectangleShape2D.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n1. Make a new scene, add a RigidBody2D as the root\n2. Add a CollisionShape2D as a child, set it to a CircleShape2D\n3. Set the shape radius to max (input 99999 it will be clamped)\n4. Press enter to apply the new shape radius, a small lag might occur\n5. Set CollisionShape2D scale to 5,5\n6. Editor hangs up\n\nNotes:\n- All CollisionBody2D's do this (Rigid/Kinematic/Static) + Area2D\n- CollisionShape2D without a CollisionBody2D does not hang up the editor\n- RectangleShape does not clamp values, so the hangup may occur before scaling the CollisionShape2D\n\nWhile obviously such sizes should be avoided, the sole ability to crash the editor should be contained.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4662/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4661","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4661/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4661/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4661/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4661","id":154915796,"number":4661,"title":"Ctrl
