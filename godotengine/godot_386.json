talked in irc about this topic.\nRigidbody that is set to \"rigid\" is the only type which can perform a body_enter signal.\nWhen set to \"static\" or \"kinematic\" no body_enter signal is triggered which is unfortunate.\n\nHere is an example project which demonstrates the behavior.\n\nAlso I would like to suggest a new type for collision shapes. It would be nice if we could set them to ghost. This will only trigger a collision signal but lets the objects intersect. I know collision shapes have a Trigger boolean. This lets objects intersect but does not trigger a body_enter signal.\nIn general it would be nice if area2d nodes can detect other area2d nodes. This is not possible either. \n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/v92amwfy0ohw0bx/collisions.zip\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/299/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/298","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/298/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/298/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/298/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/298","id":31639090,"number":298,"title":"Complex editor operations and bugs","user":{"login":"jonyrock","id":1022757,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1022757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonyrock","html_url":"https://github.com/jonyrock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonyrock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonyrock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonyrock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonyrock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonyrock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonyrock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonyrock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonyrock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonyrock/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-04-16T12:59:28Z","updated_at":"2014-04-26T12:50:06Z","closed_at":"2014-04-26T12:50:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There is a piece of code:\n\n``` cpp\n_remove_text(selection.from_line,selection.from_column,selection.to_line,selection.to_column);\n_insert_text_at_cursor(txt);\n```\n\n(at https://github.com/okamstudio/godot/blob/master/scene/gui/text_edit.cpp#L1077)\n\ncommits removing and inserting.
