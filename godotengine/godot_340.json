However, I was unable to do the simplest things and after a bit of investigation the problem seems to be that for some reason Godot is unable to overwrite scene and script files after they have been initially created. The .tmp files for those are created and updated, but the original file remains as it was upon creation. The command prompt window keeps showing the following message when I try to save a file in Godot:\n\nERROR: close: Condition ' rename_error ' is true.\nAt: drivers/windows/file_access_windows.cpp:133\n\nI am running this under Windows XP with Service Pack 3.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1671","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1671/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1671/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1671/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/1671","id":67829480,"number":1671,"title":"Lighting Broke in Demos. hash b36e41cb7117757011e6f1ccc476ccc806219a58","user":{"login":"antonyjones67","id":3905646,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3905646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonyjones67","html_url":"https://github.com/antonyjones67","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonyjones67/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonyjones67/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonyjones67/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonyjones67/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonyjones67/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonyjones67/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonyjones67/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonyjones67/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonyjones67/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-04-11T20:22:10Z","updated_at":"2015-04-12T23:41:58Z","closed_at":"2015-04-12T23:41:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Surface 2 Pro I5 Intel Graphics Chipset..
