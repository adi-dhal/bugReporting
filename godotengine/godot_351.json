works fine for dictionary, string, array, int, real and not well for anything else.\n\ne.g.\nbuilt in classes: { \"fish\": Vector2(1, 2) }.to_json() => { \"fish\": \"1, 2\" } (since any class that doesn't have a specific to_json() just uses String() operator).\nuser defined classes: { \"fish\": MyClass.new }.to_json() => { \"fish\": \"[Reference:1234]\" } (String operator hits again).\n\nWhy not have an optional to_json() method called by the Dictionary.to_json() on your own classes, if available, which converts the object into a json data string. e.g.\n\n```\nclass MyClass:\n     var name\n     var num_chickens\n     func to_json():\n           return  { \"name\": name, \"num_chickens\": num_chickens }.to_json()\n```\n\nOr, to make serialization and deserialization

}.to_json() would give: {\"frog\": { \"class\": \"my_script.MyClass\", \"name\": \"my_name\", \"num_chickens\": 12 } }\nand Dictionary.from_json() would give you the object again (well, not the same

data to strings is very bad. It is often not clear at all what type you are printing out.\n\n1) Numbers: \"2\" and 2 are printed the same (2). This is fine when writing the value directly in print, but not when it is part of a more complex data structure such as an array or dictionary.\n\n2) Dictionaries: Format isn't terrible, but it is completely different than the code to create it for no reason. e.g. {\"fish\": \"frog\", \"cheese\": \"pie\" } = (fish:frog), (cheese:pie)\n\n3) Arrays: Format isn't terrible, but it is completely different from code, which makes it very ambiguous. e.g. printing 1, [1] and [\"1\"] all give the same output.\n\nOther examples of ambiguity:\n{ \"cheese\": \"pie\", \"fish\": \"frog\" } =  (cheese:pie), (fish:frog)\n[{\"fish\": \"frog\"}, {\"cheese\": \"pie\" }] =  (cheese:pie), (fish:frog)\n\nColor(1, 1, 1) = 1, 1, 1, 1\n[1, 1, 1, 1] = 1, 1, 1, 1\n[[1, 1], [1, 1]] = 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nVector2(1, 2) = 1, 2\n[1, 2] = 1, 2\n[\"1\", \"2] = 1, 2\n\"1, 2\" = 1, 2\n[\"1, 2\"] = 1, 2\n\nI suggest one of two options:\n\n1) Following the Python standard (and any other language that outputs complex types as strings):\n- Printing string, int, real directly (so no quotes around strings).\n- Printing Array, Dictionary, in a meaningful way, exactly the same as they'd be written in code, with nested \n- Printing Vector2, Vector3, Color in a meaningful way related to the class, e.g. Vector(22.2, 4), Color(0.1, 0.2, 1, 1)\n\nCurrently, this is the output provided by Variant::get_construct_string(), but that is only used in the editor hints. For some reason, elsewhere only the \n\n2) As an alternative, how about a repr() function, as in Python, that gives us the get_construct_string() output, rather than the mostly useless (for non-basic types) String() operator output...\n\n(I'm happy to implement this stuff; just want to see which you want or will accept).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1347","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1347/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1347/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1347/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/1347","id":57176959,"number":1347,"title":"VisibilityEnabler2D - disable particles","user":{"login":"ndee85","id":6723918,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6723918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndee85","html_url":"https://github.com/ndee85","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndee85/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndee85/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndee85/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndee85/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndee85/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndee85/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndee85/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndee85/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndee85/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-02-10T13:53:27Z","updated_at":"2017-01-16T06:32:10Z","closed_at":"2017-01-16T06:31:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As already discussed and the headline says.

Viewport dimensions are set to a wider aspect ratio than my screen's.

But it's not actually that wide, so the camera's position is offcenter.  Similarly, if the viewport dimensions have a narrower aspect ratio than the screen, the camera is off center in the other direction.\n\nThe value reports this same wrong value the first time through _process.
