I'm not sure which would be the most appropriate method:\r\n\r\n- A notification that i could check for in _notification()\r\n- A signal (not sure if having signals that fire in editor/tool mode would be appropriate?)\r\n- A method that could be overridden in a tool mode script that extends GridMap, maybe _on_cell_changed(cell_pos)\r\n\r\nWith this simple addition, I could write an auto-tile editor script in GDScript that I could share with everyone. You could have variation in tiles occur automatically; ie, place a tree tile and have a random one of six tree models spawn. You could have tiles automatically rotate in specific ways.\r\n\r\nThere would be lots of possibilities opened up by this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11854","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11854/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11854/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11854/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/11854","id":263097354,"number":11854,"title":"Add

The Python 2 version uses the `ascii` encoding, but that can't be used on Python 3 since AFAICT there is no error mode that produces the desired behavior.

3.0 git HEAD 64 bit\r\n\r\nManjaro Linux 64 bit\r\nUbuntu 17.10b2\r\nWindows 10\r\n\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\n\r\nWhen navigating into a CSharp scripts folder Godot crashes if there's a .mono folder and if there are no icons of the scripts in the ~/.godot/tmp folder.\r\n\r\n@neikeq I believe this is Mono related as a lot of Mono items are in the crash log, deleting the .mono folder fixes the crash, or if I simply rename files from having .cs to .gd (and leave the .mono folder there) it no longer crashes.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n\r\nedit: Okay, I've narrowed it down a bit more. I tried it on Ubuntu 17.10b2 and I was able to navigate to the folder as long as I didn't first make a build.\r\n\r\nI was then able to cause it to break again by:\r\n\r\n1) Deleting the ~/.godot/tmp folder\r\n2) Make a build (F5/F6)\r\n3) Restart the editor\r\n4) Navigate to the Scripts folder\r\nCrash\r\n\r\nI was able to navigate again to the folder by:\r\n\r\n1) Deleting the .mono folder for the project\r\n2) Restart the editor\r\n3) Navigate to the folder\r\nNo crash\r\n\r\nSo, it seems somehow related to failing to generate icons when there's a successful build in the .mono folder?\r\n\r\nI've made a video: [DirectoryOpenCrash.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/1356420/DirectoryOpenCrash.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\n\r\nedit: Here's a simple project:\r\n\r\n[Test_Proj_CS.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/1357254/Test_Proj_CS.zip)\r\n\r\nedit: Removed the crash dump as you should now be able to get your own now that the bug is reproducible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11834/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11833","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11833/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11833/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11833/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/11833","id":262828595,"number":11833,"title":"one issue to build godot on Solus Os","user":{"login":"swipis","id":18053799,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/18053799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swipis","html_url":"https://github.com/swipis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swipis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swipis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swipis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swipis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swipis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swipis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swipis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swipis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swipis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-10-04T15:22:31Z","updated_at":"2017-10-04T16:41:03Z","closed_at":"2017-10-04T16:40:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello,\r\nNot sure I am in right place to tll about this issue but here I go - I tried to build Godot 3.0 alpha on **Solus Os** and get error that _GL/glx.h_ not found.
