desired node\r\n* Arrow keying through scene graph doesn't highlight current node\r\n* Moving objects must be done per axis instead of on a plane\r\n* Cannot drag/drop scenes directly into the editor

used [Processing](http://processing.org) and it contains a very useful function **map()**\r\nit works like this: `var result = map(v, a,b, x,y)` you pass a value **v** which is between **a** and **b** and the function will return a number between **x** and **y**\r\n\r\nex: `var r = map(60, 20,100, 200, 240)` this will return **220**\r\nor: `var g = map(0.43, 0,1, 0,255)`\r\n\r\nFrom
