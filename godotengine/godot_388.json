was trying to write some functions in a class library that was instanced via preloading\n\nie\nmylib=preload(\"res://mylib/lib.dg\")\n\nboolean=mylib.myfunction(Pos,vec)\n\nAnd the function in the lib was something like\n\nfunc myfunction(vec1,vec2):\n if vec1.x==vec2.x:\n   return true\n\nNow the function above kept giving me parsing, or expecting some identifier type error. After hitting my head against walls, I decided to just change to a and b. Then Godot stopped complaining and started working properly (ie preloaded the func form lib and executed properly)\n\nI have resolved the issue so I do not remember the exact error message but it was about gdscript.cpp line some 14xx I believe. Sorry Iw as trying to get it going so i did not keep record. However it might be worth checking.\n\nI do not think that numerals normally was  problem for variables that way..\n\nthanks\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/227","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/227/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/227/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/227/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/227","id":30185169,"number":227,"title":"High DPI Support","user":{"login":"Felbo","id":1987806,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1987806?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Felbo","html_url":"https://github.com/Felbo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Felbo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Felbo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Felbo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Felbo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Felbo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Felbo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Felbo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Felbo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Felbo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":32,"created_at":"2014-03-26T04:40:44Z","updated_at":"2016-06-26T20:34:25Z","closed_at":"2016-06-11T21:02:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'd like to look into supporting High DPI displays, in particular \"Retina\" on OS X.\n\nDoes anyone at Okam have access to the original artwork for the default UI theme?
