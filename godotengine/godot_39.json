PR adds `Object::emits_signal` to check if `emit_signal` will actually emit a signal. This came up while working on #10655, but I imagine this situation might crop up in other places as well. So this is one idea to solve it.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\nIn `Polygon2D::set_polygon`, the calculation of the item rect is currently deferred using `rect_cache_dirty`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid Polygon2D::set_polygon(const PoolVector<Vector2> &p_polygon) {\r\n\tpolygon = p_polygon;\r\n\trect_cache_dirty = true;\r\n\tupdate();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdding a signal on item rect changes might look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid Polygon2D::set_polygon(const PoolVector<Vector2> &p_polygon) {\r\n\tpolygon = p_polygon;\r\n\trect_cache_dirty = true;\r\n\tupdate();\r\n\temit_signal(\"item_rect_changed\"); // note: rect might not have changed\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, not each polygon change changes the item rect. In order to emit the signal only on actual changes, we need to break deferment:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid Polygon2D::set_polygon(const PoolVector<Vector2> &p_polygon) {\r\n\tconst Rect2 old_rect = get_item_rect(); // breaks deferment\r\n\r\n\tpolygon = p_polygon;\r\n\trect_cache_dirty = true;\r\n\tupdate();\r\n\r\n\tconst Rect2 new_rect = get_item_rect(); // breaks deferment\r\n\tif (new_rect != old_rect)\r\n\t\temit_signal(item_rect_changed);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem with the code above is that this now completely breaks deferment, even if no actual signal is attached (i.e. `emit_signal` is a noop).\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the deferment and only break it when necessary we need a way to check if a signal is attached, which this PR's `emits_signal` is about:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid Polygon2D::set_polygon(const PoolVector<Vector2> &p_polygon) {\r\n\r\n\tif (emits_signal(\"item_rect_changed\")) {\r\n\t\tconst Rect2 old_rect = get_item_rect();\r\n\r\n\t\tpolygon = p_polygon;\r\n\t\trect_cache_dirty = true;\r\n\t\tupdate();\r\n\r\n\t\tconst Rect2 new_rect = get_item_rect();\r\n\t\tif (new_rect != old_rect)\r\n\t\t\temit_signal(\"item_rect_changed\");\r\n\t} else {\r\n\t\tpolygon = p_polygon;\r\n\t\trect_cache_dirty = true;\r\n\t\tupdate();\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10714/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":1}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10713","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10713/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10713/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10713/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/10713","id":253258176,"number":10713,"title":"Dragging

With the 2nd scene active in the tabs, press the \"Play Edited Scene\" button again.\r\n5. After the scene plays, Godot has replaced my 1st scene with the 2nd one.

At the moment you're forced to go back and forth between shader and and material to set the parameters.

inspector\r\n2. don't automatically close the shader code editor when moving in the inspector & scene from shader to other resources/objects\r\n\r\nI'd be happy with either, but I don't know the
