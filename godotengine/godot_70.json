by default, applies the rotation transformations to `Spatial` in `xyz` order.\r\n\r\nFor some applications, however, it can be desirable to apply the rotations in a different order. A common example is that of a camera in a video game, where you would want to apply `y` before `x` if you wish the camera to remain horizontal.\r\n\r\nGodot doesn't currently make this easy. Currently I manually keep track of the rotation I want in a variable, then re-apply the rotations to the camera appropriately when they change, i.e.:\r\n\r\n```GDscript\r\nextends Spatial\r\n\r\nvar rotation = get_rotation()\r\n\r\n# …\r\n\r\ndef something_changing_rotation():\r\n\trotation.x += 1/100\r\n\tupdate_rotation()\r\n\r\n# …\r\n\r\ndef update_rotation():\r\n\tset_rotation(Vector3(0, 0, 0))\r\n\trotate(Vector3(0, -1, 0), rotation.y)\r\n\trotate(Vector3(-1, 0, 0), rotation.x)\r\n\trotate(Vector3(0, 0, -1), rotation.z)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerhaps Godot could do what THREE.js does, and let you change the rotation order (this might look like `.set_rotation_order(Spatial.ROTATION_ORDER_YXZ)`)? That would work well for the end-user, though I'm not sure if it would cause problems (performance?) for the Godot engine. Or, perhaps it could provide some other facility that avoids this manual handling?\r\n\r\nAnother workaround is of course to nest your camera or whatever inside another `Spatial`, and change the `y` angle on the outer one. That's not as clean, though. (For example, if you were to do this for a scene and instance it in another scene, you wouldn't be able to adjust the full rotation without turning on `Editable Children`.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9781","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9781/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9781/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9781/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/9781","id":244871182,"number":9781,"title":"3D Particles color gradient / albedo of mesh is preferred over particle material","user":{"login":"jedStevens","id":6509081,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6509081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedStevens","html_url":"https://github.com/jedStevens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedStevens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedStevens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedStevens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedStevens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedStevens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedStevens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedStevens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedStevens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedStevens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":279098111,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:rendering","name":"topic:rendering","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-07-22T20:57:46Z","updated_at":"2017-08-27T09:27:32Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\r\nManjaro, master as of posting\r\ncommit: aa798eb\r\n\r\nParticles seems to ignore any color modulation in the process material.

was already done in master and not cherry picked.\r\n\r\nAlso updated default port from 6007 (X11) to 6096 (unspec)\r\nThis might be the reason why some OSX users are reporting the port to be busy. Port 6007 is apparently used by remote X11 but on most linux distros is disabled.\r\nI know of OSX users that installs X (to run X applications) and maybe they leave the remote connections enabled.\r\nIt's a wild guess, but I can't reproduce the problems in #8563 #9635 so I came up with this speculation.\r\nThe new port 6096 seems not to be used by any known software (or malware, so the AV mafia should not complain).\r\nThis bit is not applied in master, if you agree to changing the default port we should change it there too.\r\n\r\n#8744 will need some more logs to investigate, it might be a misconfiguration due to the current messed-up config state of the branch, it that's the case, this patch should fix it.\r\n\r\nP.S.: misconfiguration can be the case also for #8563 and #9635 so again, this PR should fix it, but again again, I cannot test it because I can't reproduce

explained on IRC, there are two things wrong with the current API:\r\n- `ScriptLanguage::alloc_instance_binding_data` has no context about what to allocate. Instead, we should call `set_script_instance_binding(int lang_idx, void* data)`. The caller is in charge of allocating the data.\r\n- We need to know if there is data already attached. Either `get_script_instance_binding` should return null if there is nothing allocated, or there should be a `has_script_instance_binding` method.
