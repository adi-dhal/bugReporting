I wrote about this on IRC and the forums, but haven't made any progress, which makes me think this is a bug. Basically, Godot can't use a basic armature that is exported into a Collada file. Note that I tried both the Blender exporter as well as the one from this Github in the tools directory. Godot seems to get stuck on creating the bones after importing the file, and throws a couple of errors.\n\nERROR: add_bone:  Condition ' p_name==\"\" || p_name.find(\":\")!=-1 || p_name.find(\n\"/\")!=-1 ' is true.\nAt:  scene/3d/skeleton.cpp:247\nERROR: _set:  Index which out of size (bones.size()).\nAt:  scene/3d/skeleton.cpp:53\n\nThe second error there is repeated multiple times, after the first one. After looking at the source and changing the bone's name to \"Bone:/\", the error stopped, but the bone still doesn't show up in Godot (I assume it's supposed to look like something, like the little balls or nodes in the 3D platformer demo).\n\nhttps://app.box.com/s/qyrd87yir35nzhczczee\n\nHere's the blend file, the DAE file, and the corresponding imported SCN file that I'm working with. If it's a matter of me just not understanding the process and there needing to be documentation written for importing 3D models, then that's fine and I'll just wait.\n\nPlease test to see if you also have this same issue.
