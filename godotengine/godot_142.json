with swiping, but if the initial position that you put your finger to swipe is a meta link then the meta link will be opened.\r\n\r\nIf a large percentage of the Richtextlabel area is meta links, then it's uncomfortable to scroll.\r\n\r\nI think a meta link should only be activated on release of the press or click.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, on Android to access the home button in a fullscreen program you have to swipe from the top of the screen downward. This swiping motion also causes the Richtextlabel to scroll if your finger goes over it.

I have a suggestion to capitalize on it and make it even better. I don't think it's a huge change, but I am definitely interested in hearing your thoughts. I absolutely love a lot of parts about Godot, such as the amazing interoperability between making C++ modules, and using them in Godot and gdscript. I honestly believe that with a bit of work, this could be yet another part that hardcore users fall in love with. \r\n\r\nI think it would be a great idea to break out `modules/gdscript` into a separate repo, and any other possible parts of supporting gdscript in this repo. Especially with the work on supporting C#, this would make a clear separation between language bindings and the core engine and editor.\r\n\r\nI know you guys don't want to support a bunch of languages, and I don't blame you! I think doing this would facilitate the community to work on their own bindings if they want them, which you should not be bogged down by supporting in any way. For example, all the people complaining about supporting \"X language\" (JS, Rust, C#, etc.) could actually even more feasibly add support themselves, or start up a community effort. The less work you guys have to do, the better.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly I was one of those people complaining, as I would like to use a language with an established ecosystem that extends far outside of gamedev, such as JavaScript with all the packages on npm. My current understanding is that if I work really hard at it I can make this happen already, but I think breaking out gdscript would make the path even more clear.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7598/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7597","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7597/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7597/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7597/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/7597","id":202312454,"number":7597,"title":"LightOccluder2D transparency.","user":{"login":"MrMaidx","id":8977194,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8977194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaidx","html_url":"https://github.com/MrMaidx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaidx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaidx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaidx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaidx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaidx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaidx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaidx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaidx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaidx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":279098111,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:rendering","name":"topic:rendering","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-01-21T12:16:15Z","updated_at":"2017-01-21T12:23:09Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm developing a 2D game in which LightOccluder2D node is a great help but some of my objects should be semi-transparent.
