You can only update entire texture in video memory at once. \r\nBefore switching  to Godot I was doing this in C++/ OpenGL. Where entire environment was destroyable pixel per pixel. Doing the same in Godot is possible only to certain texture size, after that performance happens.\r\nThis kind of problem requires you to keep a copy of the textures in Ram and update any changes to Vram.\r\nThis can look like this: \r\n```\r\ndata = self.get_texture().get_data()\r\nimageTexture = ImageTexture.new()\r\nimageTexture.create(width, height, self.get_texture().get_format(), 0)    \r\nimageTexture.set_data(data)\r\ndata.put_pixel( position.x, position.y, Color(1,0,0,1), 0 )\r\nimageTexture.set_data(data)\r\n```\r\nIf you need to run following code every 5-20 frames it becomes problematic.  \r\n```\r\ndata.put_pixel( position.x, position.y, Color(1,0,0,1), 0 )\r\nimageTexture.set_data(data)\r\n```\r\nIt is possible to update texture once per second or so, but if the textures are 2048x2048 then it is still a bottleneck.\r\n\r\nBeing able to call functions like the ones defined for Image class, but straight on video memory would allow new possibilities for the engine. \r\nEspecially:\r\n```\r\nblit_rect ( Image src, Rect2 src_rect, Vector2 dest=0 )\r\nColor \tget_pixel ( int x, int y, int mipmap_level=0 )\r\nImage \tget_rect ( Rect2 area=0 )\r\nvoid \tput_pixel ( int x, int y, Color color, int mipmap_level=0 )\r\n```\r\nI was wondering how difficult would it be to add this feature?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7146/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7145","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7145/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7145/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7145/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7145","id":190238322,"number":7145,"title":"fixes

request:\r\n\r\nSince most new features will be added on 3.0 and that may include `move_and_slide`, I was thinking on the possibility to have more types of `move`, mostly for prototyping (fine tuning will always fall on pure move).\r\n\r\nThese are:\r\n-A move that push: something basic to push other colliders, common use on puzzle and some platformers.\r\n-A relative move: use transform to apply the movement, useful for FPS, third person (3D) and topdown (2D) games.\r\n\r\nThen I also thought that combinations of slide, push and local moves could be needed and got this final idea:\r\n\r\nHave a single `move` and some flags on the KinematicBody that affects the way move behave.\r\n\r\n- If no flag is on: move just works like normal move.\r\n- If relative, the movement vector will be rotated

changes introduce a new camera mode to the camera object in Godot so it can be set as a uniform left/right/top/bottom frustum. The main reason for this is to allow asymmetrical frustums which is not possible with the normal camera settings but this is needed for left eye / right eye stereoscopic rendering. \r\n\r\nNote that the frustum is defined at unit distance NOT at the near plane. This allows the near and far plane to be adjusted without needing to change the frustum values themselves.\r\nAlso keep in mind that Godot will apply the aspect ratio of the viewport you are rendering to, you should not apply the aspect ratio to the frustum yourself (many textbook FOV -> frustum calculations will do this).\r\n\r\nTo help with this the PR also introduces a few functions on the camera that allow you to set the frustum based on the intraoculur distance (distance between the two eyes) and convergence distance (distance at which they eyes converge, basically anything in front of this will seem to pop out towards you, anything behind this distance will be seen as in depth).\r\n\r\nI've got a little test project here:\r\nhttps://github.com/BastiaanOlij/StereoCameraTest\r\nThis shows the stereoscopic rendering of two eyes to a split screen. I'll be adding on to this sample project in due time to highlight some of the differences between rendering for an HMD (if you want to use this for cardboard like mobile solutions) and stereo rendering on a 3D TV.

The easiest and optimal way to achieve this could be preload const and check if the script path is null.  So with this I could use the addon  without major modifications in another project or I could put another timer script at the path for custom behaviour in a new project.\r\n\r\nNOTE: I'm aware of load and check/load the path in ready:\r\n```\r\nconst _timer_script_path = \"res://resources/scripts/timer.gd\"\r\n\r\nfunc _ready():\r\n\tvar timer = Timer.new()\r\n\tvar script = load(_timer_script_path)\r\n\tif(script != null):\r\n\t\ttimer .set_script(script)\r\n```\r\nBut that method should be less optimal because is 1 load for EACH ready vs a SINGLE preload in a CONST at start of the game\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nCreate a script and try to preload an invalid resource with a const and run the game:\r\n`const _script = preload(\"res://resources/scripts/timer.gd\")`\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7118/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7117","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7117/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7117/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7117/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/7117","id":189180123,"number":7117,"title":"No index.html created with `make html` in godot/doc","user":{"login":"romeojulietthotel","id":20975463,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/20975463?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/romeojulietthotel","html_url":"https://github.com/romeojulietthotel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romeojulietthotel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romeojulietthotel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romeojulietthotel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romeojulietthotel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romeojulietthotel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romeojulietthotel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romeojulietthotel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romeojulietthotel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romeojulietthotel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false},{"id":283518839,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"ffbbff","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-11-14T17:53:24Z","updated_at":"2016-11-17T15:31:52Z","closed_at":"2016-11-16T23:40:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\r\nLinux \r\nX86_64 \r\ngithub master branch\r\ngodot mainline\r\n\r\n\r\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\r\nNo index.html created when building html documentation\r\nAn index.html should exist according to all the links to it in the other html pages.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n\r\n`cd godot/doc`\r\n`make html`\r\n`ls -l _build/html/index.html`\r\n`/bin/ls: cannot access '_build/html/index.html': No such file or directory`\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\r\nSee above command line steps.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7117/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4835","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"D18A:572B:CFA141:1B6D23C:59D69C29","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=159>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=157>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"9a5d83a6cfca8a65b842a73d33b02ff9\"","status":"200 OK"}}
