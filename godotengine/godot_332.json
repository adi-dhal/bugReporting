I expect to continue with the same state.**\nThe worst and most notorious offender for this behaviour is animation player, for example: if the animation is playing x on second 10, on change parent, gets stuck at second 10 without autoplay, or on case of autoplay an animation, play this animation again.\n\nIt's seems that the ready event gets called on every add_child call, I don't know if this is supposed to happen all the time, and not only the first time where the node gets added to a tree.\n\nI know i could detect the change parent on notify, save the animation state, and restore it, but that is like a patch and i don't know how many node types from godot follow this behavior and I need to patch it.\n\nSo we need someway to make the base nodes don't loss the state on reparent without adding code to the reparented node, included his subchildrens.\n\nAt first we need to clarify if ready should be called on all the add_child, and not only the first one.\n\nFor possible solutions I think:\n- **Call the _ready() event only the first time and create another event for the old behavior like _on_enter_tree():** best option for me, this fix all the nodes without intervention, from the name of the event I expect this behavior, but could break some projects expecting the old behaviour, but I couldn't think a case where you need the old behaviour\n- **Add a new optional parameter or method for add children which skips the ready event:** this option is the most clean and project friendly one, make a optional parameter like add_child(Node node, bool skip_ready == false) or a new method called like add_child_and_skip_ready(Node node)\n- **Fix the behaviour for each node with problems from godot:** most time consuming option and could break some projects\n\nHere is a project with the bug:\nhttps://mega.co.nz/#!zcgxTBAa!_uC6-kA_Znuo21SPxHEi2JZ_rX3erNCNkrx0tb63hiE\n\nMore documentation of the issue and the project with the bug explained
