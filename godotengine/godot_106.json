PR adds MFI gamepad support to iOS.\r\n\r\nI've tested this with my Mad Catz CTRLi controller and everything seems to work fine. I could not find anything about implementing rumble/vibration in Apple's documentation.\r\n\r\nCurrently the pause button and gyro/accelerometer/magnetometer access is not build in. \r\n\r\nThere is one annoying bug I have not tracked down and that is that if the controller is not on and paired before starting Godot we get a 32bit conversion error because of some bogus uninitialised value. I don't know if this is a bug in my code, in iOS or in Mad Catz controller, I have found other people reporting it on other platforms. But its past midnight here, I'll do some more debugging tomorrow. Maybe someone else can find the mistake I've made :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8694","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8694/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8694/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8694/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8694","id":226987535,"number":8694,"title":"RayCast2D:

No matter which settings I choose, as soon as a texture is used in 3D it will get re-imported and suddenly ends up much darker (and it looks as if the colour depth is lower too). Wrong texture colours shouldn't happen in the first place, but this even happens with uncompressed import and with \"detect_3d=false\".\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n1. Load a texture, use it in 2D (everything's fine).\r\n2. Then use the texture in 3D, it will get re-imported with wrong colors.\r\n3. Then re-import it again - 2d view is fine. \r\n4.
