with the effort to complete the documentation of gdscript, and with effort to even make a visual programming framework, I want to suggest a few ways to make using gdscript easier to people coming from other game engines.\n\n**Helper functions (especially for vector math):**\n- Helper methods/functions for new users who are not very much into vector maths. This is something that seems to be expected when you use godot, but people coming from game maker have gotten used to the easy life. In godot to get an angle between two points - you need to write a formula. To write that formula - you need to learn vector math. When you are new to a game engine - even one with programming - GML is a much better suited to new users language. It doesnt throw vector math at you. \n\n![vectormagic-godot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6495061/14944597/bf25fa66-0fef-11e6-8dd8-0ff2b8df7cc4.PNG)\n\nIn game maker language to get the distance between two points you do this:\n`point_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2) Returns distance between two points.`\n\nget the angle between two points:\n`point_direction(x1, y1, x2, y2)    Returns direction from (x1, y1) to (x2,y2) in degrees.`\nhttps://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Game_Maker_Programming/Mathematical_calculations\n\nit's in english, easy to learn, remember, hard to get wrong. Please take a look at game maker language's helper functions. It has many good ones that let the user do the basic stuff without having to learn vector math early on. Godot throws vector math right in the start - that will drive away some people.\nlook at this (how to get an angle between two points- just a part of the code needed):\nhttp://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/vector_math.html\n`var angle_in_radians = acos( a.dot(b) )`\nIf you show that formula to a game maker developer, do you think they will get it? They have been doing this without even knowing it.\n\nI am not saying remove the old way - just saying add helper functions to make the old way easier. It will make gdscript more accessible for everyone who is not a math wizard and just wants to make a game. These are common things. You already have similar helper functions\n\n**A trigger once condition:**\nI already filed this here- https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4514\nBasically adding 'and trigger_once' to an if case, would force it to trigger whats inside it only once, even if the condition is true for more than one frame. That way we dont have to create new arbitary variables to switch it on and off, keep track of them and invite more room for errors.\nexample:\n\n```\nif myvalue>500 and trigger_once:\ndoSomething()\n```\n\n**Replace variable name globally:**\nA way to change a variable name everywhere on a script. Does godot's editor have a way to do that? I notice that in recent builds when I highlight a variable, it gets highlighted on copies. But can I also rename the variable everywhere by renaming it at one place? \n\n**Be able to expose a node and all of it's variables to the debugger**\n-so we can see them change while the game is running - without having to print them out with bazillion commands.\n\n**Autocomplete code from other scenes**\n- when you spawn an instance from an external scene - code autocompletion for it does not work. It would be nice if it did.\n\nI believe if you add a little bit of user friendliness to gdscript - especially to aid common tasks such as the ones I list here - it will make it much less scary to newcomers. \n\ncan you think of other ways gdscript could be made easier to use? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4515","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4515/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4515/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4515/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4515","id":152451283,"number":4515,"title":"Documented YSort","user":{"login":"CowThing","id":11450875,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11450875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CowThing","html_url":"https://github.com/CowThing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CowThing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CowThing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CowThing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CowThing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CowThing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CowThing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CowThing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CowThing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CowThing/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":283518839,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"ffbbff","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-05-01T21:34:08Z","updated_at":"2016-05-01T21:55:24Z","closed_at":"2016-05-01T21:55:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/4515","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4515","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4515.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4515.patch"},"body":"Documented YSort\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4514","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4514/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4514/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4514/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4514","id":152438368,"number":4514,"title":"Idea: a method to force a condition to trigger only once ","user":{"login":"blurymind","id":6495061,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6495061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blurymind","html_url":"https://github.com/blurymind","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blurymind/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blurymind/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blurymind/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blurymind/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blurymind/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blurymind/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blurymind/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blurymind/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blurymind/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279097162,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/discussion","name":"discussion","color":"ee77ee","default":false},{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":279098082,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:gdscript","name":"topic:gdscript","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":60,"created_at":"2016-05-01T21:14:01Z","updated_at":"2017-02-07T16:39:15Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"This is a very common thing in games programming. You have an if case, that you need to get checked on each frame.\n\nSo this if case, the condition get's true for more than one frames - lets say it's true for  60 -80 frames. Whats inside it will get executed 60-80 times. If you are spawning an object - gets spawned 80 times. If you are playing a sound effect - 80 times.\n\nWhat if you need it to execute only one time  - on the frame the condition became true. Very often you do.\nPlease correct me if I am missing something, but you have to create a new variable - to switch it on and off, and sometimes on again - it's messy.\n\nNow a lot of hardcore programmers out there might get annoyed I am proposing this, but not why have a common method to force the block of code in an if case to trigger only once while true?\nIt's so common that even python programmers have been looking for it:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/4103773/efficient-way-of-having-a-function-only-execute-once-in-a-loop\n\nmore user friendly competitor game engines already have that - its called 'trigger once' condition. When you add 'trigger once' to a condition - whats in it executes only once:\n\n> construct2 has it (clickteam also):\n> https://www.scirra.com/manual/124/system-conditions\n> Trigger once while true\n> Turn an ordinary event (which is tested every tick) in to a trigger. For example, if an event plays a sound when lives equals 0, normally this event runs every tick. This plays about 60 sounds a second and would sound pretty bad. Adding Trigger once while true after the other conditions makes the event run just once when it first becomes true. This makes the previous example only play a sound once the first time your lives reaches 0. It must be the last condition in an event.\n\nThis could help gdscripters use less convoluted code to get what they want, create less utility variables and switches.\n\nBut what would the syntax be? I think maybe something like:\n\n> time= time+delta\n> if time>500 and **trigger_once**:  get_node(\"sound\").play(\"hit\")\n\nThis is a very crude example. Yes I could just as easily put if time=500 instead. But sometimes you cant. sometimes you are forced to use > because it's likely that the frame gets skipped, maybe something else will force you to be very specific and not be able to limit the execution to only one frame in which it will be true. How many times have you had to make arbitrary new variables to force it to trigger once. We can get cleaner code if we had  a way to force it like that\n\nPlease add to gdscript a trigger_once condition - to force the events of the met condition to execute only once - on the first frame the condition is met.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4514/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4513","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4513/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4513/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4513/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4513","id":152426053,"number":4513,"title":"Unit Offset displayed as integer","user":{"login":"henkz1","id":17125468,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/17125468?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/henkz1","html_url":"https://github.com/henkz1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henkz1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henkz1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henkz1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henkz1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henkz1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henkz1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henkz1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henkz1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henkz1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-05-01T20:54:55Z","updated_at":"2016-06-15T14:40:28Z","closed_at":"2016-06-15T14:40:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Operating system or device:**\nUbuntu 16.04\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nEntering 0.5 in \"Unit offset\" for PathFollow/PathFollow2D is displayed as 0, it is still set to 0.5 but the box only shows 0 or 1, it displays correct value while editing.

system or device:**\nWindows 10 Pro\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nWhen setting rot from script you must use deg2rad, but in editor it's in degree. It was supposed to be either everything in radians or in degrees. At the very least something in the docs saying that it was in radian.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nAttach a new script to a sprite and write set_rot(80). It's going to be completely erroneous. Now put set_rot(deg2rad(80)). It works just fine.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4510","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4510/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4510/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4510/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4510","id":152335383,"number":4510,"title":"Documented
