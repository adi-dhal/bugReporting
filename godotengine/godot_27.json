First off all for a debug build I'm giving a bit more feedback about Godot is attempting to load. Helps find the answer to these issues way more quickly.\r\n\r\nThere were two issues preventing the exported application bundle to run properly on OSX.\r\n\r\nThe most important was that the change in the project datapack loading code now calls exec_path.get_basename() as we want the name of the executable and the name of the datapack to be the same. This failed on OSX because the last dot in the executable path name is actually the \".app\" of the bundle name stripping of far to much, and because the full path is evaluated we're not using the resource path that was made current in the startup code.\r\n\r\nI've changed this to take the dataname from the actual filename and then checking if we can open a datapack in either the location of the executable or in the current directory.\r\n\r\nThe second issue was that the bundle wasn't exporting the textures, so that code has been added. By default it exports s3tc textures which seem to be the ones used on OSX.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11062/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11061","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11061/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11061/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11061/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/11061","id":256112490,"number":11061,"title":"Add a segfault handler to dump the backtrace on Windows, Linux and OS X","user":{"login":"marcelofg55","id":10578225,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10578225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelofg55","html_url":"https://github.com/marcelofg55","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelofg55/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelofg55/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelofg55/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelofg55/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelofg55/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelofg55/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelofg55/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelofg55/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelofg55/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-09-08T01:03:12Z","updated_at":"2017-09-19T15:07:43Z","closed_at":"2017-09-13T16:05:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/11061","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/11061","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/11061.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/11061.patch"},"body":"Same as #10124 but for 3.0","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11061/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":3,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11060","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11060/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11060/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11060/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/11060","id":256092144,"number":11060,"title":"Scons multithread compilation and *.gen files issue on Windows","user":{"login":"mrcdk","id":483531,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/483531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcdk","html_url":"https://github.com/mrcdk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcdk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcdk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcdk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcdk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcdk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcdk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcdk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcdk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrcdk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2017-09-07T22:45:50Z","updated_at":"2017-09-11T16:47:36Z","closed_at":"2017-09-11T16:47:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device, Godot version, GPU Model and driver (if graphics related):**\r\n\r\nWindows 10 x64. \r\n\r\n```\r\nZ:\\cpp\\godot>scons --version\r\nSCons by Steven Knight et al.:\r\n        script: v2.5.1.rel_2.5.1:3735:9dc6cee5c168[MODIFIED], 2016/11/03 14:02:02, by bdbaddog on mongodog\r\n        engine: v2.5.1.rel_2.5.1:3735:9dc6cee5c168[MODIFIED], 2016/11/03 14:02:02, by bdbaddog on mongodog\r\n        engine path: ['C:\\\\development\\\\Python27\\\\Scripts\\\\..\\\\Lib\\\\site-packages\\\\scons-2.5.1\\\\SCons']\r\nCopyright (c) 2001 -

it is some work to make a 3d character work!\r\n\r\n### Basics:\r\nthere are two option:\r\n - rigid body with character mode\r\n - kinematic body\r\n\r\nBoth modes don't allow for rotation on the y axis which makes them hard to use.\r\n\r\nthis would be the idea character gdscript I could imagine:\r\n(this example is for rigid body in character mode)\r\n```gdscript\r\nexport var speed = 0.5\r\n\r\n_ready():\r\n   Input.set_mouse_mode(MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED)\r\n\r\n_process_input(ev):\r\n   if ev is InputEventMouseMotion:\r\n      $Camera.rotate_x(ev.relative.y / 100)\r\n      rotate_y(ev.relavtive.x / 100)\r\n\r\n_process(delta):\r\n   var dir = Vector3()\r\n   if is_action_pressed(\"forward\"):\r\n      dir += Vector3(1,0,0)\r\n   if is_action_pressed(\"backwards\"):\r\n      dir += Vector3(-1,0,0)\r\n   if is_action_pressed(\"left\"):\r\n      dir += Vector3(0,0,-1)\r\n   if is_action_pressed(\"right\"):\r\n      dir += Vector3(0,0,1)\r\n   set_linear_velocity(dir * speed * delta)\r\n```\r\nthat would be just great since it would be super easy to understand and super short.\r\n\r\n\r\n## the issues\r\nSince rotate_y does not work for **rigidBody** (in character mode) it is much harder. (need to do math in which direction the camera looks and than modify the direction based on that...)\r\n\r\nThe issue with **kinematic body** is:\r\nmove_and_slide is global.. that means you have to do a vector transformation to get the vector pointing forward in global space.\r\n\r\nI think kinematic body is the better character anyways since it allows for really simple jumping and move and slide is pretty nice too.\r\n\r\nIt seems like **they were inspired by their 2d counterparts**. that explains why character mode has NO rotation at all (for rigidbody)\r\nand why move and slide uses global axis.\r\n\r\n**So for 3.0 the api for those bodies should be adapted for 3d.**\r\n\r\n## what I actually propose:\r\n### option one (kinematic body):\r\n - add a function move_and_slide_global\r\n - add a function move_global\r\n - make move_and_slide, move use local vectors.\r\nOR\r\n - add a param for local movement to both functions: \r\n   - `move_and_collide( Vector3 rel_vec, local=true )`\r\n   - `move_and_slide( Vector3 linear_velocity, local=true, Vector3 floor_normal=Vector3( 0, 0, 0 ), float slope_stop_min_velocity=0.05, int max_slides=4, float floor_max_angle=0.785398 )`\r\n\r\n### option two (rigidBody, in character mode)\r\n - allow rotation on the y axis (keep rotation on x + z disabled)\r\n\r\nI think even implementing both is a really good idea since I don't see a reason why there should not be the option for rotating on the y axis or why there should be no local axis move and slice","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11050/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4966","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"AAB4:6E5E:47E7EC:A71DBD:59D69A06","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=28>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=26>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"c72130a5387af7d1e779275257da801d\"","status":"200 OK"}}
