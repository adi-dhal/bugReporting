Currently, the content workflow for 3D assets is set up as follows:\n1.  A designer/modeler/animator develops a new asset (or changes an existing one) using a 3D modeling/animation tool.\n2. The new or modified asset is exported as either a single COLLADA scene or one or more OBJs.\n3. The exported COLLADA file or OBJ file(s) are then converted to Godot scene(s) by launching Godot and using an \"import\" dialog.\n4. If the asset is a new asset, it is then referenced or copied into the node tree of another scene, but if it's an already existing asset, Godot detects the change and allows you to reload the referenced scene easily.\n\nMost of this is just fine and enables a little basic automation (for example, Blender can be configured to export models with a preset, and the referenced scene reloading in Godot is simple and convenient), but the biggest (and most time consuming) thing standing in the way of fully automating the process is the lack of a command-line conversion (\"import\") utility that accomplishes what the scene import dialog does.\n\nIf Godot had such a command-line interface, teams could easily set up watch utilities (such as a [GulpJS + gulp-watch](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-watch) script) to automatically convert modified COLLADA files into Godot scenes (and maybe backup the new files upon conversion).\n\nThis reduces content changes down to a very quick:\n1. **Export the COLLADA file and wait a second or two** for a watch script to convert the exported scene (from a COLLADA file to a Godot scene) using Godot's command-line conversion utility.\n2. When your (already launched) Godot instance notices the file changed on disk, **click to reload!**\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/532","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/532/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/532/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/532/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/532","id":36041547,"number":532,"title":"Help -
