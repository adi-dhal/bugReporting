I [uploaded a test project](https://github.com/sheepandshepherd/godot-octree-bug-test) to try figuring out what the issue is, and to make sure it isn't specific to my game.\n\nAs many details as I could get from the test project:  \n- Non-flat meshes are fine.\n- The disappearances only happen at those specific, consistent values. Moving the tiles up or down by even 0.001 causes them to appear normally.\n- Whether the MeshInstance is saved in the scene or created at runtime makes no difference.\n- I added TestCubes as children of all the tiles. The TestCubes that are children of the \"invisible\" tiles are rendered normally, and in their correct positions.\n- The mesh used doesn't seem to matter; I originally had the problem with a simple quad exported from Blender, and the same thing happens with a simple plane created with SurfaceTool.\n- I don't know if it has anything to do with culling, but rotating the camera around to any angle has no effect on which tiles are visible.\n- The \"invisible\" tiles are also invisible in the editor.\n- In the editor, moving an \"invisible\" tile to a different y position does not make it visible again until the scene is saved and reloaded.\n\nScreenshot from the test project showing the quads being rendered in most of the MeshInstances, but those at y = -5/-1/+3/etc. are invisible:  \n![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/p0emyE1.png)\n\nIssue #3253 might be the same, although these MeshInstances are invisible at runtime as well as in the editor.\n\nFinally, I noticed an octree error that might be related while I was testing. As mentioned above, moving the problematic MeshInstances up/down by 0.001 makes them visible again (they only disappear at specific integer values); however, if I do this in a function while the game is running, instead of the tiles becoming visible again, I get [this error message](http://i.imgur.com/NjLrAln.png) once for each \"invisible\" MeshInstance in the scene (but not for the properly rendered MeshInstances). Issue #3325 mentions this error as well, but in different circumstances.\n\nNot sure how Godot's octree works, but because the \"disappearing points\" repeat consistently every 4 units, I wonder if completely flat meshes at the exact border between octree nodes are somehow not getting sorted into any node, and so not rendered at all. The octree error when moving \"invisible\" MeshInstances: `ERR_FAIL_COND( e.octant_owners.front()==NULL );`, from [here](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/core/math/octree.h#L942).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3576/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3575","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3575/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3575/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3575/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3575","id":131192292,"number":3575,"title":"x11:

1**\n\nWhen making a very long connection between an output socket and an input socket, the node editor view will scale 2x on the X axis (and then snap back when you do another edit).\n## **Bug # 2**\n\nWhenever a node is deleted, it will immediately invoke a grab operation on a random node and give it an offset relative to the mouse (deleting a selection should leave nothing selected and movable because what was selected was deleted).\n\n---\n\nThese two bugs should be very simple to reproduce as you don't need any specific setup.

Say you have an animation set up in the animation player, and you are referencing a node that exists in the current scene file; If you then delete that node, any tracks that reference it will also be deleted.\n\nI can see how this might make sense, but I found myself in a situation where I lost a good chunk of work:\n\nI had a item–a sword specifically–attached to the player, and was animating it from the player scene. I later decided that it should be a pickup and removed it from the player, deleting several animations. Since you can create animations that reference a node path that doesn't exist, and then add the node via script at run time, I had assumed this would work, but instead wound up having to redo my work.\n\nGiven that we can create an animation with an invalid path, and that the engine will provide a helpful error if the path isn't valid at runtime, should Godot not keep the animation tracks? Or ask before deleting them?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3562/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3561","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3561/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3561/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3561/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/3561","id":130865081,"number":3561,"title":"update

I tried shift, control, meta nothing.  The only way I can detect them is event.shift in _input(event) and worst of all they can only be detected when modifying another key (see below). Has something changed or is this intentional or is it my system? I am following an older tutorial that did it this way so I assume it used to work before. \n\nthe tutorial is here\nhttp://www.gamefromscratch.com/post/2015/01/28/Godot-Engine-Tutorial-Part-3-Program-Lifecycle-and-Input-Handling.aspx\n\nSo as i said before modifiers only get detected in events under _input(event) the event.shift (or any other modifier specific event) is not detected unless another key is pressed making Shift press detection  by itself currently impossible.\n\nif (control.shift): # this works but the input event is not triggered when shift (or any modifier is pressed by itself) so nothing happens until you press another random key \n\nAnd last point is Shift (or any other modifier key) does not work by themselves in InputMap (I made another issue for this one #3551)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3551","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3551/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3551/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3551/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/3551","id":130652063,"number":3551,"title":"modifier keys (shift, ctrl...) should also work by themselves in input map","user":{"login":"trollworkout","id":6987027,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6987027?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trollworkout","html_url":"https://github.com/trollworkout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trollworkout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trollworkout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trollworkout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trollworkout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trollworkout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trollworkout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trollworkout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trollworkout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trollworkout/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279097780,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:osx","name":"platform:osx","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2016-02-02T11:17:42Z","updated_at":"2016-06-04T18:54:15Z","closed_at":"2016-06-04T18:54:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Generally games don't really care much about modifier keys other than just another button to press.
