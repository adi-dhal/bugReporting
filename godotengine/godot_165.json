a monolithic issue (#3916) does not make it easy to discuss specific points, let's split some topics in their own issue (always referencing the main one) so that we can progress forwards.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHere I'd like to discuss the inclusion of headers in `.cpp` and `.h` files.\r\nI can see two main points:\r\n## Ordering of headers\r\n\r\nCurrently I can't see a specific ordering scheme for headers in cpp and h files, see e.g. https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/drivers/unix/memory_pool_static_malloc.cpp and https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/drivers/unix/memory_pool_static_malloc.h\r\n\r\nI would propose this format (taking the above `drivers/unix/memory_pool_static_malloc.cpp` as example):\r\n\r\n```\r\n/* memory_pool_static_malloc.cpp */\r\n/* License header */\r\n                                                // newline\r\n// own header file comes first, only in .cpp of course\r\n#include \"memory_pool_static_malloc.h\"\r\n                                                // newline\r\n// engine specific headers come then, in alphabetical order\r\n#include \"error_macros.h\"\r\n#include \"os/copymem.h\"\r\n#include \"os/memory.h\"\r\n#include \"os/os.h\"\r\n                                                // newline\r\n// system-wide and/or thirdparty headers come then, with `<>` format\r\n// (proper include path should be given for thirdparty headers so that both\r\n// thirdparty and system can coexist without having to use dirty defines everywhere)\r\n// we write the .h part too because we're not Windows Explorer ;)\r\n// also alphabetically sorted\r\n#include <stdio.h>\r\n#include <stdlib.h>\r\n                                                // newline\r\n/* code starts here */\r\n```\r\n## Inclusion of headers used in the cpp file: cpp or corresponding h file?\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/6920#pullrequestreview-5836867, we need a convention regarding where to place headers when they are used only in the cpp file.\r\n\r\nHere I have little experience so I would welcome input from veteran C++ developers.\r\n\r\nIntuitively, I would propose to put the includes in the files that uses it, i.e. when an external header is needed only in the .cpp file and not the .h one, put the include in the former. The .h therefore would only contain the includes necessary for its classes and methods

affected by lag. According to this issue, custom mouse pointers will be rewritten in 3.0 so they use the system's API instead, then I guess they won't be affected by lag anymore.\n\nReal life example:\n![](https://i.gyazo.com/334d7c3fc523cbf51452d2edaccac16c.gif)\n\nAnd that's changing the position of the sprite using `_input`, inside a `CanvasLayer`.  Is there maybe an alternative method we can use before waiting for 3.0? (If it's even noted :P) This is essential for Hotline Miami / top down shooters.

A collision is correctly reported, but the resulting speed of the involved rigid body is completely wrong.\nIn the project I linked a ball moves towards a vertical rectangle in a diagonal direction. After the collision the horizontal movement is reflected (correct), but the vertical is also reflected, resulting in the ball going back in the direction it came from.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nCreate a RigidBody and put it on a path that collides with a StaticBody in an angle. \nSet a speed that is large enough for ccd to be applied.\nSet friction and gravity scale to 0 and bounce to 1 on both bodies.\nSet Continuous CD to Cast Ray.\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very

I like how blender offers info on how many times a certain resource is used and I think godot can benefit from something like this as well.\n\nExample gotcha which isn't easy to detect: make an Area2D with CollisionShape2D and set the Shape parameter, Duplicate the Area2D and reuse it (say you have multiple objects that have the same Shape, but different scaling). Let's say we have 10 of these objects but 2 of them have are smaller, they still look the same so the Shape can work with them but it just needs to have different extents. We don't want to use scale here cause it might involve physics etc. (and if it isn't Area2D maybe it's Static2D, it's the same).\n\nProblem is, if I make a script with an export var called scale_extents for example so that I can calculate different dimensions for Shape, then all of the Area2D nodes will be affected and it isn't easy to remember which resource is being reused.\n\nA counter in the inspector on the property with reused resource would be nice, something like blender has perhaps\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6922/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6921","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6921/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6921/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6921/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6921","id":185262259,"number":6921,"title":"PAUSE_MODE_PROCESS Doesn't Inherit when Set From Code in Certain Situations","user":{"login":"Gastronok","id":10686700,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10686700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gastronok","html_url":"https://github.com/Gastronok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gastronok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gastronok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gastronok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gastronok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gastronok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gastronok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gastronok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gastronok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gastronok/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-10-25T23:44:38Z","updated_at":"2017-05-06T08:27:08Z","closed_at":"2017-05-06T08:27:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\nGodot 2.1 Stable, Win64\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nI've got menus whose pause mode are adjusted in code. I have a Panel which has PAUSE_MODE_INHERIT by default, but is set to PAUSE_MODE_PROCESS in _ready(). It has an ItemList child which has PAUSE_MODE_INHERIT. Even though the code reports get_pause_mode() of then Panel as PAUSE_MODE_PROCESS from within the code, the ItemList acts as though paused. If I set the Panel to PAUSE_MODE_PROCESS in the editor, it behaves as it should.\n\nThe expectation is that any nodes with PAUSE_MODE_INHERIT that are immediate children of nodes with PAUSE_MODE_PROCESS should not behave as though they're paused.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nCreate a Panel, set it to PAUSE_MODE_INHERIT. Have its _ready() function call set_pause_mode(PAUSE_MODE_PROCESS). Give it an ItemList child with PAUSE_MODE_INHERIT, and add_item(\"Anything\") to the ItemList.\n\nRun the application and have it pause (possibly via a _ready() function). You will not be able to click on the ItemList item, even though it has PAUSE_MODE_INHERIT and its parent has PAUSE_MODE_PROCESS.\n\n**Link to minimal example project**:\nHere's an example demonstrating the difference between a parent with PAUSE_MODE_PROCESS set in the editor and PAUSE_MODE_PROCESS set in code.\n\n![example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10686700/19708168/7df38474-9ad1-11e6-828b-260d84dd64b8.png)\n\nBoth panels report a get_pause_mode() of 2 at runtime, but only the ItemList whose parent was set to PAUSE_MODE_PROCESS in the editor is selectable.\n\nHere's the project example:

This might be logical from the implementation point of view but from a developer point of view it doesn't. An example why I don't like this. I'm trying to keep track of the player health in some singleton or with `Globals` when changing scenes so I do:\n\n``` python\n\nexport var hp = 100 setget set_hp\n\nfunc _ready():\n    if Globals.has('player_hp'):\n        self.hp = Globals.get('player_hp')\n\nfunc set_hp(x):\n    Globals.set('player_hp', x)\n    hp = x\n```\n\nThis doesn't work when using `export` like in the above example because the setter gets triggered when the node enters the scene so the `if` in `_ready` will always get triggered and resets the player hp to the default value. This is unwanted and if I'm not using `export` it works as expected.\n\nSo there's an inconsistency on how the setter is triggered between using and not using `export`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6916/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6915","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6915/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6915/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6915/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6915","id":184919290,"number":6915,"title":"Double-click project file to open it in Godot","user":{"login":"vnen","id":5599796,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5599796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen","html_url":"https://github.com/vnen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":283518733,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"007700","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-10-24T18:32:21Z","updated_at":"2017-05-02T09:32:48Z","closed_at":"2017-05-02T09:32:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"One of the usability problems that still remain is that it's a bit hard to open a project directly from the file explorer with Godot. You can open through command line or create a custom shortcut for each project, but it's cumbersome.\n\nSince for 3.0 the project file will change name, might be a good opportunity to change this behavior.\n\n**My proposal:**\n- Change the `engine.cfg` to a file with custom extension, like `project.gdp` (`.gdp` for Godot Project, open to suggestions of course).\n- Change the command line to accept a `.gdp` directly, without `-path` specifier (currently the expected argument is the starting scene path).\n- Run the editor by default if it's a `tools=yes` binary.\n\nThis will allow the file to be associated with Godot and even be dragged & dropped over the Godot executable to open it. Also, it'll be possible to use a custom icon for Godot projects. It'll enable the recent file list on Windows, like my idea in #5653 and some other OS-specific possibilities.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6915/reactions","total_count":14,"+1":14,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6914","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6914/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6914/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6914/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6914","id":184915468,"number":6914,"title":"Expose
