system or device - Godot version:**\r\nWin10x64pro v1703 b15063.540 w/Asus Sabertooth x79 using Realtek ALC892 audio chipset, Windows spatial sound filters active. Godot v3.0 alpha 1536cc4\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nI executed Godot, then while it was idle on the project selection interface, I plugged in my headphones. On my system (Win10x64pro v1703 b15063.540 w/Asus Sabertooth x79 using Realtek ALC892 audio chipset) my headphone jack in the front disables the rear speaker and makes the headphones (considered another device) the primary Windows audio output device. When this occurred, Godot crashed. This did not happen when I tried to simulate it by changing my audio device in the Windows audio device manager with a new instance of Godot loaded to the same state. The crash also did not occur when I unplugged my headphones, only when plugging them in. This led me to suspect the problem is not with changing devices. I realized I was using the Dolby Atmos audio filter with 7.1 virtual surround enabled (Windows 10 spatial audio), which is configured only for use with my... *headphones*. When I right-clicked my audio TSA icon and hit the menu option for Atmos, I found it had silently crashed, and Windows had now detected it, offering to reenable the application. I then disabled Atmos, and all filters. I ran Godot and repeatedly plugged/unplugged the jack. Everything was fine. I activated another filter, Windows Sonic for Headphones, again with virtual surround on. Again Godot crashes on device change. Disabling the virtual surround had no effect, still crashes. Also tested with the editor in other states, like with a project loaded, same result as expected. Opening the editor and toggling the effect on my headphone device settings while they are active causes no error.\r\n\r\nMSVS2015 JIT debugger reports an unhandled win32 exception at 0x0007FFF6EF9A7CA5\r\n\r\nBreaking execution at the exception puts me on the last brace of RtApi :: error. errorText_ reads \"RtApiDs::callbackEvent: error (Buffer lost) getting current write position!\"\r\n\r\n**Conclusion**\r\nChanging audio devices while Windows spatial sound filters are enabled causes an unhandled exception due to the output stream buffer being lost. But why is this a problem only when using spatial audio with device changes, not software changes? Is this actually a Windows bug to work around? I'm not sure how to best handle this, so I leave the code to others this time.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nEnable spatial audio filters in Win10CE. With Godot loaded, plug/unplug headphone jack on an audio chipset with jack detection and retasking causing the filter to become enabled/disabled by the device change notification.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10221","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10221/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10221/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10221/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/10221","id":249286963,"number":10221,"title":"Mipmap related rendering glitches in 3.0 alpha 1","user":{"login":"Zireael07","id":4525388,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4525388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zireael07","html_url":"https://github.com/Zireael07","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zireael07/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zireael07/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zireael07/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zireael07/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zireael07/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zireael07/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zireael07/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zireael07/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zireael07/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-08-10T09:32:07Z","updated_at":"2017-08-10T18:22:50Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\r\nWin 7 x64 \r\nGodot 3.0 alpha 1\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nPictures are worth more than a thousand words.\r\n\r\n![godot_v3 0-alpha1_win64_2017-08-10_11-20-19](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4525388/29164121-ca682ca8-7dbe-11e7-8830-d9776fe5fef6.png)\r\n\r\nThe only practical difference between the left and right road is the size.

system or device - Godot version:**\r\nWin 10 Godot 3 current build\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nWhen environment>ambient light>sky contribution is at 0, materials behave as you would expect. In the first image, the sphere on the left is full metallic(1) with a roughness of 0.2. The sphere on the right is a dielectric material (metallic = 0) with roughness of 0.2.\r\n\r\nThe image looks as you would expect, with the rough metal sphere on the left receiving reflections from the environment, and no need for any ambient lighting from the environment HDR. The dielectric sphere on the right has some reflections but since there is no lighting in the scene(ambient or lights) it looks black. All is good!\r\n\r\n![sky_contrib1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7741669/29156499-97deef98-7de5-11e7-935b-3089afd9f157.jpg)\r\n\r\nIn this next image, the environment>ambient light>sky contribution is set to 1 (which it should be as the new default). The dielectric material on the right is as you would expect, since it is now receiving ambient light from the HDR. However, the metallic sphere on the left is now looking very incorrect, even though the material has not changed since the first image.\r\n\r\nIt should look the same as it did in the first image, but for some reason the environment ambient light is effecting it(It is fully metallic/reflective so shouldn't be effected by ambient light). It looks like it is multiplying the ambient value over the reflection. This also occurs when a procedural sky is used instead of the HDR. \r\n\r\n![sky_contrib2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7741669/29156664-6cd96098-7de6-11e7-931b-2d9ba052c64e.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n\r\n-change environment>ambient light>sky contribution to 1 with a sky(hdr or procedural)\r\n-add a mesh with a full metallic material\r\n\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\n<!-- Optional but very welcome.
