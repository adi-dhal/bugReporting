button should be hidden, if no AnimationPlayer node is selected. It can lead to idea you can use editor without the AnimationPlayer node. You can crash the editor doing this:\n1. Create an empty scene (do NOT add node AnimationPlayer)\n2. Create a new animation resource.\n3. Copy Resource (gear icon in inspector)\n4. Paste Animation (gear icon in animation player)\n\nThe other fix would be to disable Animation Tools icon if no node is

system or device - Godot version:**\nGodot v2.1.beta.official\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nOkay an EditorPlugin putting a scene as a child of its EditorPlugin node has one very big issue - it goes over top menus!!! That will not work for anything other than temporary popup dialogs, certainly not for any long-lived editor control. I still do not have complete information on how to properly make an EditorPlugin that uses the edit area used by 2D, 3D, Script, AssetLib. It's clear that defining has_main_screen() and get_name() are not enough here. For one thing there needs be a method the plugin can call to determine the appropriate parent to place the plugin's edit controls (as a scene). Overriding .edit() also isn't the solution here because edit controls like AssetLib don't edit a defined object type yet can still use this area.\n\nFurthermore the editor automatically adds your plugin's name (the string returned by the plugin's overridden .get_name() method) to the edit mode (2D, 3D, Script, AssetLib) menu when it activates but does not remove it when the plugin is deactivated. This is most likely a bug since the plugin itself has no way to remove its name from that menu since the script itself never added it to begin with.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nplugin.gd:\n\n```\nfunc get_name():\n  return \"MyPlugin\"\n\nfunc has_main_screen():\n  return true\n\nfunc _enter_tree():\n  # plugin does not itself the name into the menu as\n  # editor does this automatically when plugin activated\n  pass\n\nfunc _exit_tree():\n  # the editor automatically added plugin's name\n  # thus there is nothing to uninitialize to remove the name\n  pass\n```\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\n(The above script should be referred by an appropriate plugin.cfg that references it)\nWhen activated it will appear in the menu alongside 2D, 3D, Script, AssetLib (etc.) but when deactivated the plugin's menu name (string returned by overridden get_name() method) that was automatically added on activation is not correspondingly removed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5754/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5753","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5753/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5753/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5753/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5753","id":165978953,"number":5753,"title":"AcceptDialog layout and resizing problems","user":{"login":"pkowal1982","id":19764492,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/19764492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkowal1982","html_url":"https://github.com/pkowal1982","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkowal1982/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkowal1982/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkowal1982/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkowal1982/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkowal1982/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkowal1982/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkowal1982/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkowal1982/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkowal1982/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-07-17T14:26:59Z","updated_at":"2016-07-17T14:51:18Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Operating system or device -

But, I've been having to use other software while using Godot to do things that i am accustomed to doing in other IDEs (IntelliJ, Eclipse, XCode, etc.)  \n\nOne of the biggest ones has been \"Find Occurences\".  I've been using Grep to find all occurrences of a code or the uses of a method.  Being able to quickly find these sorts of relations in the editor would be fantastic, like right clicking a method/variable and \"find all usages\".  (I know Godot doesn't have right-click, but you get the idea.)\n\nAnother would be multi-pane editing.  Only being able to have one GDScript pane open at a time (instead of side-by-side) cuts down on some productivity.  I have been having to keep a Notepad++/TextMate open at the same time with multiple scripts to look at them side-by-side.  \n\nAdditionally, the quick open (ctrl + shit + o) is great for Scenes, but it would be nice if it could search for file names of GDScripts as well.\n\nThanks for all you do, guys.
