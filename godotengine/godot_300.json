Use rtl=yes in command line to enable it.\nText rendering and alignment implemented only for Button and Label but other controls(TextEdit, LineEdit, RichTextLabel) only have text rendering and not alignment.\nI didn't removed unused files from icu source because maybe some of them can be use later.\nCompilation tested for linux, windows(mingw) and android.\n\nHow to test:\n- Compile editor and export templates with rtl=yes option.\n- Add a RTL keyboard(language) to your device.\n- Import a suitable font.Enable unicode when importing.\n- Add font to Settings -> Editor Settings : Global/Font, Text Editor/Font.\n- Restart Editor.\n- Add some of controls mentioned above that support RTL.\n- Change controls font to imported one.\n- Finally, Test it!\n\nThis is based on mohaalak and masoudbh3 previous works.

quite hard to explain the bug, but this is a sample code to recreate it:\n\n``` GDScript\nextends Button\n\nvar menu = PopupMenu.new()\n\nfunc _ready():\n    add_child(menu)\n    connect(\"pressed\", menu, \"popup_centered\")\n    menu.add_item(\"First\", 101) # index 0\n    menu.add_item(\"Second\", 102) # index 1\n    menu.add_item(\"Third\") # index 2\n    menu.connect(\"item_pressed\", self, \"_menu_item_pressed\")\n\nfunc _menu_item_pressed(id): # or index if the item has no id\n    if id > 100:\n        print(menu.get_item_index(id))\n    else:\n        prints(id)\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n0 # First\n1 # Second\n0 # Third! Should be 2! How can two items have the same index!?\n```\n\nThis PR fixes it. I still find it confusing to use (specially when procedurally adding items to the menu), since you don't know if the parameter passed is the id or the index... IMO the best would be to pass both with the _item_pressed_ signal.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2861/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2860","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2860/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2860/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2860/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2860","id":118212386,"number":2860,"title":"Canvas editor selection menu shortcuts are pathological under *nix","user":{"login":"seadra","id":9574367,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/9574367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra","html_url":"https://github.com/seadra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":23,"created_at":"2015-11-21T18:18:09Z","updated_at":"2015-11-22T01:30:19Z","closed_at":"2015-11-21T19:24:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue is about #2786\n\nUnder Linux and BSDs, Alt+Right Click or Alt+Click don't even go to any app by default.
