I really miss on my game design road with Godot Engine is the option to live debug the runtime scene. Currently we have the Remote Inspector, which does 80% of the job. But on dynamic scenes it is not enough.\r\nSometimes we need to visually pick a specific object and modify it. With the current Live Scene Tree, we have to bruteforce every instance of the object to reach the one we want to modify. \r\nMy proposal is: when we hit \"Pause Scene\" in the editor, a new scene tab would be created reflecting the Live Scene Tree root node (the viewport with all the child nodes). This way we could visually debug our game and fine tunning some properties this will also enable some new features:\r\n\r\n- Be able to save a resource created in runtime, since all the nodes would be instaced on a temporary scene, the Editor Inspector would be avaible so, we could save runtime resources if wanted so.\r\n- Be able to test game stages without manually reproduce'm. Let's say we want to test a moving platform, and see how the player's node react to it. Try some cliff and edge animations, and such. Currently we need to manually put the player's node on the platform's edges, and if it is moving, good lucky to find how you player will behave to this.\r\n-And more\r\n\r\nI made a minimal viable project to show the overall concept:\r\nPlay the testScene\r\nPress ctrl + enter to pause and save the scene state you want to debug\r\ngo the savedScene.tscn and debug it :D\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4qLEmhydQzlTHY4SUxDZVItRHc/view?usp=sharing\r\nI also made a video, avaible on our facebook group:\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/godotengine/permalink/882432988559963/?comment_id=883630085106920&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R%22%7D","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7169/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7168","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7168/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7168/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7168/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/7168","id":190798441,"number":7168,"title":"Pause scene sometimes not working in the editor","user":{"login":"henriiquecampos","id":10171059,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10171059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/henriiquecampos","html_url":"https://github.com/henriiquecampos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henriiquecampos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henriiquecampos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henriiquecampos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henriiquecampos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henriiquecampos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henriiquecampos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henriiquecampos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henriiquecampos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henriiquecampos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-11-21T18:26:51Z","updated_at":"2016-12-04T14:17:15Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"**Windows 10 -
