Godot for release gives consistent `SIGSEGV` signal when running some of the demos. It seems to be related to the resource loader based on what I get from backtraces.\n\nThis is what I get in master with the GUI drag and drop demo (I get an identical BT in other GUI demos, such as _input mapping_ and _translation_):\n\n```\n(gdb) where\n#0  0x0000000000594937 in DVector<String>::resize(int) ()\n#1  0x00000000011fdd8c in ResourceInteractiveLoaderBinary::parse_variant(Variant&) ()\n#2  0x00000000011fc669 in ResourceInteractiveLoaderBinary::parse_variant(Variant&) ()\n#3  0x00000000011ff94b in ResourceInteractiveLoaderBinary::poll() ()\n#4  0x000000000122692a in ResourceFormatLoader::load(String const&, String const&, Error*)\n    ()\n#5  0x00000000012260b9 in ResourceLoader::load(String const&, String const&, bool, Error*)\n    ()\n#6  0x0000000000429ff3 in Main::start() ()\n#7  0x000000000040d0ed in main ()\n```\n\nI went as far as 37af8b4 and still get the same thing, even with a clean build.

So I guess this can be some compatibility breakage introduced somewhere, so old binary scenes don't load right. It certainly can be something else.\n\nAnd I hope somebody else can reproduce this issue or I may have to burn my computer 👿 \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4622","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4622/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4622/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4622/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4622","id":154269892,"number":4622,"title":"editor does not update distance field font when reimported, and flood the console with error","user":{"login":"SuperUserNameMan","id":9801802,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/9801802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan","html_url":"https://github.com/SuperUserNameMan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-05-11T15:17:39Z","updated_at":"2016-06-17T19:01:53Z","closed_at":"2016-06-17T19:01:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\nOfficial Godot 2.0.2_stable win64\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nWhen I reimport a distance field font using the \"import -> font\" menu, the editor does not update appropriately, and the background windows terminal console is flooded with error messages :\n\nERROR: get: Condition ' !elem ' is true. returned: __null\nAt: core/rid.h:146\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n1.

Create a scene with a FileDialoge on it\n2. Add a new theme to the FileDialoge\n3. In the Theme menu select Add Class and add the VScrollBar\n5. You may edit the values in the Styles section\n4. Save the theme in tres format\n5. Run the scene and you should get 2 debug errors: \nERROR: texture_get_data: Condition ' texture->data_size==0 ' is true. returned: Image()\n   At: drivers/gles2/rasterizer_gles2.cpp:1110.\nERROR: texture_get_data: Condition ' texture->data_size==0 ' is true. returned: Image()\n   At: drivers/gles2/rasterizer_gles2.cpp:1110.\n6. Select the Icons/Decrement load a 1x1 transparent image\n7. Save and run the project, now the error should be gone\n\nI guess it is because in the default_theme.cpp:\n\n```\nt->set_icon(\"increment\",\"VScrollBar\",empty_icon);\nt->set_icon(\"increment_hilite\",\"VScrollBar\",empty_icon);\nt->set_icon(\"decrement\",\"VScrollBar\",empty_icon);\nt->set_icon(\"decrement_hilite\",\"VScrollBar\",empty_icon);\n```\n\nand when I save the theme those empty values are saved.\n\n**Expected behaviour:**\nThe problem was for me the I just saw the 2 error in my game and I didn't get a clue what was going wrong. Even if I ran Godot with -v option it was really hard to figure out what was wrong.\nPerhaps it would be great if where an image could be empty and it is empty the program would not throw an error. Or when I add the VScrollBar to the scene these value got filled with 1x1 px transapent image so not editing these values wouldn't throw an error.\nOr maybe there were a theme check utility which would point out theme errors if there is any. Or I don't know.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4618","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4618/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4618/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4618/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4618","id":154213941,"number":4618,"title":"Mac export does not set the binary as executable","user":{"login":"azurvii","id":3889447,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3889447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/azurvii","html_url":"https://github.com/azurvii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azurvii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azurvii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azurvii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azurvii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azurvii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azurvii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azurvii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azurvii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azurvii/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false},{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097780,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:osx","name":"platform:osx","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279098255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:porting","name":"topic:porting","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":8,"created_at":"2016-05-11T10:48:44Z","updated_at":"2016-07-14T07:54:46Z","closed_at":"2016-07-14T07:54:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\nMac OS X 10.11.4, Godot 2.0.2.stable.official\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nExporting Mac binary, the app does not run.

start the game in fullscreen creates a pretty weird output window.\n- It has no borders (not really wrong).\n- The top left corner is at Windows' default window position, not at 0,0 (thus, it wanders a bit every time I start the game, from close to top left to further down right).\n- It extends over the screen borders, still having the desktop resolution's size.\n\nBasically, it looks like this:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9631152/15123792/90ebc946-1625-11e6-8b00-50dcd95517fe.png)\n\nThat game's internal resolution is 640x480. I think there are only two things wrong:\n- The window must correctly get tucked to 0,0. Right now it looks like CW_DEFAULT is passed to the startup coordinates, IIRC.\n- It must be above the taskbar.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4599/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4598","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4598/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4598/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4598/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4598","id":153839279,"number":4598,"title":"Added caret blink to the text editor","user":{"login":"Paulb23","id":6584330,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6584330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Paulb23","html_url":"https://github.com/Paulb23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Paulb23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Paulb23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Paulb23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Paulb23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Paulb23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Paulb23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Paulb23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Paulb23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Paulb23/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-05-09T18:29:33Z","updated_at":"2016-05-11T07:33:12Z","closed_at":"2016-05-11T07:33:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/4598","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4598","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4598.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4598.patch"},"body":"Added caret blink to the text editor with two settings.
