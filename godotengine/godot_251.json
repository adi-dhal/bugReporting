It would be great if this space could be used for other docks too. Like the file browser to have access to some assets in the whole bottom part of the editor.\nSo it would be cool if the animation, Output and the Debug tab could be treated like any other dock.\n(placed wherever the user wants them to be placed)\nSince you often don't need these windows and I really like the concept of godot that only the things that are needed will be displayed, there possibly could be a button that lets the bottom area open and close. Or clicking the curent tab could minimized the bottom area. (and of course the bottom area should be opened automatically when an animationPlayer node is selected or the game is started...)\n\nIt also would be really useful to be able to place two docks at the bottom area.

In the linked minimal project, eight sprites should be positioned on each eight directions of another one. However, it's currently impossible to position them automatically in such way that even if we change the assets, the positioning will still be correct (ie you always have to hardcode the position according to the assets dimensions).\n\nWhat I have:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1037931/14581839/2deaa4c4-03f7-11e6-9951-31218652ec64.png)\n\nWhat I'd like to have (of course, the assets here are very simple, in my actual project each direction has a different texture):\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1037931/14581828/f1a21f74-03f6-11e6-8a6a-84f94567bbf6.png)\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nHere's what I tried:\n- A TextureFrame inside a Container doesn't work, because there's no way to set one of the two related margins to `auto` like it would be possible in css. In css, if you the left margin to `auto` and the right margin to `0`, the engine will understand that the element should be anchored to the right side of its referential, and take as much size as it needs, but no more.\n- Using Sprites set up with a 90¬∞ rotation followed by a negative scale work for the corners, but not for the North-North / East-East / South-South and West-West directions, because this technics require the sprite to tick off the \"Centered\" property for one of the axis to work - and unfortunately, the other axis requires this property to be ticked on to work.\n\n**Link

Create a new scene, add a root Control node\n2. Add a ScrollContainer element\n3. (Example steps) Add a VBoxContainer\n4. Add a Button to the VBoxContainer, set some text\n5. Duplicate the button a couple of times\n6. Rescale the ScrollContainer until the vertical scroll bar appears\n7. Start the scene\n8. Scrolling is possible only when not hovering over a button\n\nA silly workaround that kinda works, attach this script to every button (or attach to one and duplicate again)\n\n```\nfunc _input_event(ev):\n    get_node(\"../..\")._input_event(ev)\n```\n\nKeep in mind that this introduces other bugs, as the buttons dont get blurred (lose focus).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4331/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4330","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4330/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4330/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4330/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4330","id":148748230,"number":4330,"title":"Stay safe Reduz","user":{"login":"Ace-Dragon","id":10081256,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10081256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ace-Dragon","html_url":"https://github.com/Ace-Dragon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ace-Dragon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ace-Dragon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ace-Dragon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ace-Dragon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ace-Dragon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ace-Dragon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ace-Dragon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ace-Dragon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ace-Dragon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-04-15T19:30:19Z","updated_at":"2016-04-16T11:46:42Z","closed_at":"2016-04-16T11:41:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Okay, I know this isn't standard fare for Godot's issue tracker, but a comment from Reduz late last month indicated that he is currently in Japan (the country which just saw two powerful earthquakes hit in the past couple of days).\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2016/04/15/asia/japan-earthquake/index.html\n\nI sure hope he's okay (either he felt the shaking and is unharmed or he was not in the region at that time).
