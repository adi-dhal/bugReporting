It is very portable. It can replace Theora, OGG, Vorbis, Opus and other libraries (Speex decoder in FFmpeg uses libspeex). It has also its own audio resampler (with audio channel expansion) and video scaler (with pixel format conversion). It has also various audio and video filters which can be used.\n\nFFmpeg is optimized for performance, e.g. libvorbis is slower than built-in FFmpeg Vorbis decoder:\n`ffmpeg -i Test.ogg -acodec pcm_s16le -f wav - &> /dev/null` - 0.51 sec\n`oggdec -o - Test.ogg &> /dev/null` - 0.87 sec\n\nFFmpeg can be linked statically or dynamically. Its configuration tool allows to enable only needed formats and codecs.\n\nFFmpeg has also its own protocol support (http, https, file, rtsp, rtmp, ftp, etc...). They can be compiled-in and used (also in other Godot parts), or they might be disabled during compilation. Then custom IO reader can be created which will use Gotots' file and network functions.\n\nIt also can decode still images like JPEG/PNG/GIF, but I've never used FFmpeg for still images :)\n\nSee

many context, specially those with a lot of information to store such as user information, progress, logins & scoreboards, databases are fundamental to those applications/games.\n\nUnfortunately, there's no support for larger scaled databases in Godot and the current format is extremely limited.\n\nThis is why I suggest the implementation of ODBC with, as suggestion, [nanodbc](http://lexicalunit.github.io/nanodbc/). \nIt is MIT licensed, light and cross-platform.\n\nWhy do I suggested ODBC over any other specific method/protocol? \nSimply because it's supported by most of database softwares (e.g.: Microsoft SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.) with a generic syntax and it's platform independent.\n\nLet me know your thoughts about it.\nThanks! :smile:
