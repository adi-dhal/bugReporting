Thanks!\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\r\nGodot v2.1.2 Stable.\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\n<!-- What happened, and what was expected. -->\r\nTL;DR version: Basically the following is spamming the debugger output. Although collisions are working fine.\r\n\r\nFile: area_2d.cpp , line: 165\r\n```\r\nERR_FAIL_COND(!body_in && !E);\r\n```\r\n\r\nDetailed verison: my issue is that I am trying to implement a node that changes its children after a set of time (like toggle between two states every 5 seconds). When I do `add_child` to the node that contains Area2D, and at the same time, let's say the player was in the location where the object is about to toggle its state by adding child node, the error happens (using `add_child`). The Area2D has `body_enter` signal.\r\n\r\nHave a look [here in the forum's post](https://godotengine.org/qa/4846/remove_node-gives-strange-error-on-specific-node-structure) about this issue. I was kind of happy when I thought the issue is fixed, when I changed the overlapping collision shapes of the node containing Area2D (the parent node has a KinematicBody2D too). But soon I realized the issue appears again when dealing with other nodes (like the one toggles its state) at the same location.\r\n \r\nThings I tried, \r\n- `call_deferred` for adding or removing the node that contains the Area2D didn't work.\r\n- disconnect before removing Area2D's parent (using `remove_child`) and `connect` again before `add_child`\r\n\r\nMy only option which I don't like to go there, is to make Area2D permanent and never removed or added (by putting it in a different parent), and switch or toggle states using code. That would be ugly.\r\n\r\nLike I said, collisions are working fine, even when `add_child` for the Area2D (maybe the collisions are reported in the next frame, which I don't care as long as they are reported). Only the debugger output spamming. I wish to know if there is a cleaner approach.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions!\r\n\r\nIssues similar to this:\r\nIssue #3589 (closed)\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\n<!-- Optional but very welcome.

Thanks!\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\r\nLinux XUbuntu 16.04.1, Godot 2.1.2\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\n<!-- What happened, and what was expected. -->\r\nMy code is with weird behavior. I try to prealloc the scene in the main scene as children, for example: the Game scene creates two instances from another two scenes and the game scene add the two as children. So, with this I tried avoid reloading the sub scenes.\r\nThen, when I try active one scene, I use:```\r\n\r\n\t# name is the name of new scene\r\n\tif (name == \"mainmenu\"):\r\n\t\tmainmenu.set_as_toplevel(true)\r\n\t\tmainmenu.show()\r\n\t\tmainmenu.set_pause_mode(PAUSE_MODE_PROCESS)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tif (level == null):\r\n\t\t\tlevel = Level.instance()\r\n\t\t\tadd_child(level)\r\n\t\tlevel.hide()\r\n\t\tlevel.set_pause_mode(PAUSE_MODE_STOP)\r\n\t\tget_tree().set_pause(true)\r\n\t\tset_pause_mode(PAUSE_MODE_PROCESS)\r\n``` ```\r\n\r\nWhats happens is the scene freeze when add another child the buttons of the scene stops to receive input, but the scene node with the buttons still running, because it was setted with PAUSE_MODE_PROCESS and the other child was setted with PAUSE_MODE_STOP, but the buttons from the first scene not works properly, it's like the scene was setted with PAUSE_MODE_STOP too.\r\n\r\nSo, to activate one scene, I set the hidden to PAUSE_MODE_STOP and the other scene as toplevel and set the pause mode to PAUSE_MODE_PROCESS, I think that this mode the buttons should works fine, but not, the buttons are freeze!\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\n[Test.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/811229/Test.zip)\r\n\r\nPress space to show messages, you will see that when freeze the scene not stop, but the buttons not process signals\r\n\r\n#","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7915/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7914","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7914/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7914/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7914/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7914","id":211055122,"number":7914,"title":"Implement
