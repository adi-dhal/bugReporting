system or device - Godot version:**\r\nWindows 7, Godot Godot_v2.1.3-stable_win64\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nAnimationPlayer track keys can not be loaded again after first loading with ResourceLoader.\r\n \r\nSituation: We are in an **in-game** Level Editor, not in Godot Editor!\r\n\r\nAfter modifying a previously loaded scene and loading it again, modified AnimationPlayer track keys are not loaded instead they keep their modified value even if the whole scene (including the AnimationPlayer) is queued_free and completely reloaded from disk.\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\nAnimation track keys (which are part of the loaded Scene) are are the ones in the loaded Scene not the ones in memory of the queued_free scene.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\nI chose GDScript modified scenes (.tscn) as a save format, so I can also use the Godot Editor to tweak the Levels. \r\n\r\nLoading:\r\n`playable_map = load(path).instance()`\r\n\r\nI also tried to disabling caching:\r\n`playable_map = ResourceLoader.load(path,\"\",true).instance()`\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nFollowing the steps in the attached project to reproduce the bug\r\n- Load saved map\r\n- change track keys\r\n- Load map again\r\n\r\n-> changes to track keys are not loaded, but other changes to other nodes are.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example

lit/shadowed.\r\n\r\nThe reason why this is a problem is simple: With CanvasModulate, it is possible for unshadowed areas to be dark, and set the equivalent of ambient light, but there is no way to mask some areas to always be fully lit, or have different ambient from within a shader.\r\n\r\nThis might be something of a corner case(though IMO, not really), but I'm sure that it is possible to find other issues with the system as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10091/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10090","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10090/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10090/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10090/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/10090","id":248063386,"number":10090,"title":"Clicking
