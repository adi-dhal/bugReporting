function and change ENetAddress structure to allow for IPv6, include the files that implement the socket functions for the library using Godot sockets (two new files `godot.cpp` and `enet/godot.h`).\r\n\r\nIt also adds non-blocking mode for PacketPeerUDP (only available via C++) so ENet should be almost as performant as with the raw sockets.\r\n\r\nWith this PR builtin enet gets

description:**\r\nIf a scene indirectly inherits another, it doesn't get properly updated in the editor.

Notice how the node you created now appears as owned.\r\n9.a. If you reload __C__ again, everything will be in place (with the phantom node gone).\r\n9.b.

So every time I save my scene is getting additional copies of the nodes from __A__ being wrongly identified as owned (not inherited).\r\n\r\nStrage enough, if I remove some nodes from __B__ and reload __C__, at a certain point the issue starts to apply to less nodes. Not every node I remove from __B__ has this effect.\r\n\r\nAlso when saving __C__ I get a bunch of errors like this:\r\n```\r\nERROR: SceneState::get_property_value: Condition ' p_node<0 ' is true. returned: Variant()\r\n   At: scene\\resources\\packed_scene.cpp:1032\r\n```\r\n\r\nSome clue about where is the problem in my scenes or in Godot's source?\r\n\r\n**Please! This is a show stopper for me.**\r\n\r\nEDIT: One more thing I've found is that I if write a script that loads __C__ and saves it, it gets saved correcly. So the process of packing/unpacking seems to be the place to look.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n~~Haven't found yet. Just happens with my game. I've tried to create a minimal project that shows the issue, but this doesn't happen there.~~\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n~~At least after applying the work-in-progress fix #7978, I can reproduce it by loading an scene and another that inherits indirectly from it. When saving the former, the latter is updated making a mess.~~\r\n\r\nA possible reason is that when the scene is saved, its state is recreated and it no longer has a node path cache as when it's firstly loaded.

I've decided to put this in as a pull request because the place this is in now it would be good to get some feedback and it may be useful for others. It is at a stage where its a workable solution however so far I've been treating this as a prototype. My plan is to build a small demo with this over the coming weeks as time permits and fix up some more rough edges. \r\n\r\nNote that this uses the camera changes in PR #7778 and as that is still an outstanding PR I'm guessing those changes will be mixed in with this :)\r\n\r\nI've also got a small test godot project over here:\r\nhttps://github.com/BastiaanOlij/TestOpenVR\r\nNothing exciting, just a few blocks and objects for the lighthouse boxes and controllers but it shows how this module works. \r\n\r\nThere are still a number of rough edges especially around compiling and linking. OpenVR, regardless of suggesting its Open, is partially closed source and tied into SteamVR so it requires linking with a library and inclusion of a DLL. My knowledge of Scons is still very much lacking in order to clean this up. Also I've only made this work on 64bit Windows. In theory OpenVR should support Linux and Mac but I have no access to Linux atm and I haven't gotten it to work with a Mac (mainly because the Vive refuses to work with it). \r\n\r\nThe other area that needs improvement is the way the render targets are output to OpenVR, its workable but not pretty. Godot for obvious reasons expect the render targets to be used further on in its pipeline, not redirected to some external device. In the same line of thought, the output to screen needs more work, with VR requiring a high framerate (90fps - 120fps) to prevent motion sickness v-sync needs to be turned off but as a result we're also rendering at that frame rate to screen. Total overkill as we're only rendering to screen for spectators. \r\n\r\nFinally, because I attempted to implement this as a module I made spatial nodes that are automatically repositioned by OpenVRs tracking information. It was particularly nice as this allowed me to show the interaction in the editor. I later abandoned that idea because OpenVR turned out to be very unstable when both the editor and when running your project tried to output to the HMD. So OpenVR is only accessed when running your project. In that line of thought an approach similar to how controllers are handled in the input classes may be a better approach. I think this is worth discussing especially as this may allow us to implement modules for different VR SDKs which store the relevant tracking data into a centralised array maintained by the input class.  \r\n\r\nAnyway, looking forward to getting some feedback. My end goal is to redo this work for Godot 3 from scratch, take anything people offer here into account and come up with a production ready solution.

`AudioServer.generate_state` are mark to return a `AudioServerState`, but there is no reference of this type anywhere\r\n- core_bind.cpp: `_Marshalls::base64_to_raw` is marked to return a `RawArray` which is an out-of-date alias to `PoolByteArray` (i.e. `PoolVector<uint8_t>`)\r\n- visual_script: `VisualScriptPropertySet` properties' names start with `property/...`, this is a pretty strange name given slash is not a valid variable character for most languages (including C++ and GDscript) so doing `VisualScriptPropertySet.property/set_mode` is impossible...\r\n- control.cpp: `Control.get_minimum_size` is binded two times (has a virtual and a regular method)\r\n- packet_peer.cpp: `PacketPeer.put_packet` is declared has returning an `Error` type which is never defined
