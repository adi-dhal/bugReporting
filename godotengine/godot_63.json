system or device - Godot version:**\r\nMacOS 10.12.1 / Godot v3.0.alpha.build.1\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nVisualScripting local vars loose properties on run scene and or when closing and reopening file. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nNew project,\r\nAdd Node,\r\nAdd child Node2D of Node,\r\nAttach VisualScript script to Node2D,\r\nCreate '_ready' function,\r\nAdd LocalVarSet to _ready,\r\nduplicate LocalVarSet,\r\nset LocalVarSet's to Vector2,\r\nrename LocalVarSet's to 'one' and 'two' respectable,\r\nset LocalVarSet ( \"one\" ) to Vector2(0,1),\r\nset LocalVarSet ( \"two\" ) to Vector2(1,0),\r\nLink _ready to the LocalVarSet's in a chain ( _ready -> LocalVarSet ( \"one\" ) -> LocalVarSet ( \"two\" )  ),\r\nPress play Scene.\r\n\r\nThe local vars should now change and have the same value. \r\n\r\ni found this but trying to compare the key presses code ( eg. 'w' -> 87 ) but the numbers would always revert to one of the keys i was trying to compare with. think i had to rewrite the codes a min 6 times before they got stuck and didn't change when i hit the play scene button.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\n[test.8 - bug reporting
