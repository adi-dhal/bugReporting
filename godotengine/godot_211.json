The idea would be that this approach would greatly reduce the complexity in making a functional merge possible because scene instances are entirely self-contained and it would be far easier for Godot to determine how to add them back (unlike the 1.x series where the code may have to figure out complex non-instanced hierarchies added to the scene). In other words, non-instanced nodes added to the scene would still disappear (and as such Godot wouldn't have to deal with them).\n\nI guess it could or could not be explained better (hence why I added the

Notice that the crash don't happens immediately, you need to trigger it by passing the cursor over the 2D or the 3D viewport, or creating a new scene.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5546","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5546/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5546/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5546/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5546","id":163682039,"number":5546,"title":"Button focus text color","user":{"login":"vnen","id":5599796,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5599796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen","html_url":"https://github.com/vnen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279537176,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/hacktoberfest","name":"hacktoberfest","color":"00eeee","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-07-04T13:55:30Z","updated_at":"2017-01-02T11:55:38Z","closed_at":"2016-12-21T20:15:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Currently you can set the hover text color for a button, but this only triggered by the mouse.

often)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5540/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5539","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5539/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5539/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5539/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5539","id":163581534,"number":5539,"title":"Fix

on Godot 2.0.3 on Windows 10 64 bits\n\nI wrote a simple script to render a laser pointer and put it on a `Sprite` node.\nHowever, as soon as I reloaded the scene, the sprite was unexpectedly offset.\nIt turns out my `laser_pointer.gd` script had an `offset` variable, which already exists in `Sprite`.\nBoth `offset` fields were deserialized to the value from the script, and I lost the previous value my sprite originally had.\n\n![unexpected_shadowed_variable](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1311555/16546343/aeb438b2-4147-11e6-821b-4c9c185d8dc9.png)\n\nIn the scene file you can see this:\n\n```\n[node name=\"arm\" type=\"Sprite\" parent=\"pivot\"]\n\nz/z = -1\ntexture = ExtResource( 2 )\ncentered = false\noffset = Vector2( 0.1234, 0 )

)\nflicker_interval_msec = 100\nthickness = 3\noffset = Vector2( 0.1234, 0 ) <-----------------------------------\n```\n\nBecause you can inherit Node2D and still be able to put the script on Sprites, RigidBody or anything, it makes it hard to show a warning in the code editor.\nSo, we could show a popup when the script is added or when the scene is loaded? Or better, prepend something to the property so it doesn't interfer (`script/stuff`\").\nAny ideas?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5531","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5531/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5531/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5531/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5531","id":163561920,"number":5531,"title":"set_hidden function versus the \"Visible\" inspector item - naming inconsistency.","user":{"login":"Sslaxx","id":324679,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/324679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sslaxx","html_url":"https://github.com/Sslaxx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sslaxx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sslaxx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sslaxx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sslaxx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sslaxx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sslaxx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sslaxx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sslaxx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sslaxx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279097162,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/discussion","name":"discussion","color":"ee77ee","default":false},{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":8,"created_at":"2016-07-03T13:18:52Z","updated_at":"2017-01-13T17:48:59Z","closed_at":"2017-01-13T17:48:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Godot 2.0.3, OS is N/A.\n\nLooking at the inspector for (for example) the pause_panel node in the pause demo, the property for visibility is called (unsurprisingly) \"Visible\", set to on or off.

system or device - Godot version:**\nWindows 7 - 2.0.3\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nWhen .resume() -ing a .yield() -ed function, that function is resumed but it is also called again\n\nThis means that if you attempt to .yield() and then .resume() _ready(), the game crashes (due to the fact that the game crashes when _ready() is called in scripting after it's initial calling once the script is loaded, which I assume is intentional)\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n1. Create scene with single node with attached script\n2. .yield() and then .resume() _ready\n3. Observe crashing of game\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\n[Yield
