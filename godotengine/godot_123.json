am trying to sort a list of objects in C++ per distance to an object, as fast as possible.\r\nThe problem is, I cannot carry the object's position in the comparer, which is expected to be static:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n\t// Same in List and Vector\r\n\ttemplate <class C>\r\n\tvoid sort_custom() {\r\n```\r\n\r\nLast time I had to do this for an algorithm I wrote, I added two arguments instead, which allowed me to pass any data structure I wanted to carry for the callback, as if it was a lambda capture (this pointer, some struct etc).\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\ntypedef bool(*Predicate)(Vector3i pos, void * context);\r\nvoid some_algorithm(Predicate test, void * context);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, sort_custom would looks like this:\r\n```cpp\r\ntemplate <typename T>\r\ntypedef bool(*Comparer)(const T & item, void * context);\r\n\r\nvoid sort_custom(Comparer<T> test, void * context);\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr alternatively, for header-only code, expect a struct with a `()` operator, nicer because type-safe:\r\n```cpp\r\nstruct Comparer {\r\n    bool operator()(int a, int b) {\r\n        // ...\r\n    }\r\n    int some_var;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid sort_custom(T comparer);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is C++03-ish as well, but I don't know how C++11 lambdas can be used in Godot at the moment...\r\nThe only workaround I have at the moment is to use a global variable, which is really ugly.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8170","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8170/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8170/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8170/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8170","id":217101462,"number":8170,"title":"Include
