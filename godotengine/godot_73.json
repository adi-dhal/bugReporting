Godot we are still using C++ 98/03. The aim of this issue is trying to decide whether we must still stick to it or either we can start using some modern C++ (C++11/14/17 and even 20) stuff.\r\n\r\nWhen Godot was initially written, C++03 was the most current version and years later that style (version of the standard, avoidance of the standard library, etc.) was kept to avoid compatibility problems on certain compilers (some consoles, as far as I know). But we should recheck these concerns.\r\n\r\nItems to consider (this list is intended to keep growing or having some entries discarded; just brainstorming at first):\r\n\r\n- **Smart pointers:** Is Godot custom pointer/object mechanism compatible with that? Would Godot need to be rewritten in a big part to use them? Would the benefits be bigger than the cost?\r\n- **Move semantics:** Questions to ask here are more or less the same as for smart pointers.\r\n- **`auto`, `constexpr`, lambdas, etc.**: In general, any modern C++ feature that makes writing code easier and/or provides some chance of optimization without disrupting the current core.\r\n- **Standard multiprocessing primitives**: C++ now provides standard threading, atomics, memory barriers, etc. Do we have to keep custom implementations and maintain them for different platforms?\r\n- **STL/Boost/other**: Would we get some benefit by switching from custom containers to a good well-known implementation? Dis/advantages rergarding maintenance, performance, compatibility, etc.\r\n- **`register`, inlining \"tricks\", etc.**: Stuff added to the code to try to make the compiler generate more performant code. Some of them either are deprecated or have no actual impact, or even can worsen performance. Which to drop? Which to keep?\r\n- etc,\r\n\r\nSmall changes could be done early. But when should big changes (in its case) done? Godot 4.0?
