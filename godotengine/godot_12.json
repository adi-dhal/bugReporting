(But backtrace from terminal included below.)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nPlace something that inherits from Range in the scene (I've tried ScrollBars, ProgressBars etc...) then have a script call unshare() on it. Like this -> get_node(\"VScrollBar\").unshare(). If .share(some_other_range) was not called on it previously, the game crashes. If the Range IS \"sharing\" with another range, calling .unshare() twice will cause it to crash. (First unshare will do what it's supposed to, second will crash it). I expect it to do nothing normally, I'm not sure what else it could do, but at least not crash.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\nMinimal example project.
