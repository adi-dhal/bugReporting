If so, perhaps we should check if a dialog is visible before handling that input in editor node, which I am not sure how to do since:\n\n> _EditorNode_ inherits from _Node_ so it cannot call

info about this issue** is basically inside this comment: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/3352#issuecomment-171688699\n\n---\n\nWhen empty scene is opened, some people would generally want to use inheritance scene feature but they are not aware of the fact that it's under Scene->New Inherited scene. They are trying to click + sign above the scene tree tab, and because it's dimmed, it looks like it's impossible to create new scene with root from the different scene. \n![inheritancescenehint](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6129594/12328843/988a1dd6-badd-11e5-9d38-36fb9813e171.png)\n**I think that the '+' should not be dimmed so much in this case, and after click there should be dialog popup with text something like: _\"To create inherited scene you need to click Scene->New inherited scene\"_**\n\nAs a side note: Some might think it would be good to remove Scene->New inherited scene, and put this functionality under '+' sign when scene tree is empty. I don't think it's a good idea since Inherited Scenes works slightly different then regular scene instancing, and the fact that it's creation is putted somewhere else might be good indicator of that (and hint for users to check documentation on how exactly it's working).\n\nIt would be ideal to have this in 2.0 since this is first stable with this functionality.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3352/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3351","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3351/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3351/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3351/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3351","id":126678515,"number":3351,"title":"Fix

thing is, in Godot the modifier keys **SHIFT, CTRL, ALT/OPTION and WINDOWS** keys for\nboth the left and right side are considered as the same key. Pressing left CTRL should be different\nthan pressing the right CTRL. Same for the other modifier keys. In Godot, left and right modifier keys share the same scancode.\n\nFrom my experience with DirectInput in DirectX, it can be done. although Godot does not use DI.\n\nAlso, provide an option to disable propagating the **WINDOWS** key event to the OS, when Godot window is focused. Again, it can be done in DirectInput but don't know how Godot deals with Input. Currently, when I set up an action to use the windows key in game, when pressing it the start menu pops up.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3347/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3346","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3346/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3346/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3346/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3346","id":126527970,"number":3346,"title":"Quaternion uniform assignment.","user":{"login":"SaracenOne","id":12756047,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/12756047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne","html_url":"https://github.com/SaracenOne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":279098111,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:rendering","name":"topic:rendering","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-01-13T22:11:35Z","updated_at":"2016-01-14T08:17:36Z","closed_at":"2016-01-14T08:17:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/3346","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3346","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3346.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3346.patch"},"body":"Fixes a bug which prevents shader vec4 uniforms from assigned to by quaternion types.

It's possible to assign the \"Wheel Up Button\" and \"Wheel Down Button\" of a mouse to actions, but they don't seem to be triggered when scrolling the wheel.\nOn the other hand polling for mouse wheel events works just fine.\n\n**This works:**\n\n```\nfunc _input(event):\n    if event.type == InputEvent.MOUSE_BUTTON:\n        if event.button_index == BUTTON_WHEEL_UP:\n            print(\"wheel up (event)\")\n        if event.button_index == BUTTON_WHEEL_DOWN:\n            print(\"wheel down (event)\")\n\nfunc _ready():\n    set_process_input(true)\n```\n\n**This does not work:**\n\n![script1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4701338/12302758/2b3337d8-ba27-11e5-871b-a1058bb548a3.png)\n\n```\nfunc _fixed_process(delta):\n    if
