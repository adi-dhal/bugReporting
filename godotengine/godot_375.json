The idea is to match the current desktop resolution (whatever it's at), and perhaps rendering as a so-called \"borderless window\".\n\nObviously, this would be best suited for fullscreen (speaking in terms of what your eyes see, not API). In windowed mode, the closest you could come would be a \"maximized\" window, which may or may not be supported on all desktop platforms. Of course, some users would want to set a specific resolution and have the windowed behavior unchanged but the fullscreen behavior set to scale the emulated resolution up or down as is done on mobile, either scaling the 3D or not.\n\n[s]Also, is there a way to not show the \"GODOT GAME ENGINE\" logo on startup?[/s] Ehh, I found it. In the project settings, you go to startup_logo or something. Needs documentation.\n\nRegarding the auto screen res thing, that's sort of how it usually works on Linux/X11 anyways. It's a pain the ass to change the actual desktop resolution, so a big borderless/chromeless window is what is done.\n\nSource: http://www.tonyobryan.com/index.php?article=9\n\nSee? It shouldn't be hard for a serious programmer like you.\n\nIf a similar type of implementation could be employed on other platforms and allowing for pixel-to-pixel matching automatic resolution, that'd be awesome. The command to change the resolution programatically would make it even better because you could start with the splash window then go fullscreen at a time of your choosing.
