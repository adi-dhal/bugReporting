system or device - Godot version:**\r\nThis was tested with version 3: e64b82ebfcc3475c7a7d2a9196bfe20d6c9e3614 version 2: 408f91024c1babc5b60a8fa283a51c44637e00b6\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\n_Background:_ Last day I was working on porting plugin from godot 2 to godot 3. So it's a little special case since almost any script was a tool. In normal project conversion works quite well. \r\nAlso I will not enlist problems with variable/function name changes since those are expected to be fixed by the develop on his own.\r\n\r\n**The list:**\r\n- [x] Groups are not converted\r\n- [x] Path9Frame nodes are not converted  (class name change to NinePatchRect)\r\n- [ ] ~~Tool scenes are forgetting outgoing signals that were defined in editor~~\r\n- [ ] Control.filter is always `ignore`, this can be misleading, see above and #9657.  Conversion from `focus` would be welcome. \r\n- [x] Tool Control scenes are losing their size\r\n- [x] Tool Control scenes are losing their position\r\n- [x] Tool Control scenes are losing their anchoring\r\n- [ ] Tool scenes are sometimes re not linked to their scripts (not very often, haven't isolated)\r\n- [ ] Old .fnt are not recognized #9610\r\n- [ ] Converter is unable to convert some models imported from dae file #9715\r\n\r\nSome properties for animation are not converted (sorry don't have a list at the time, but for me it was most of Control ones (inside rect)), not sure what is status of others?\r\n- [ ] (not 100% sure) all inside Control.rect \r\n- [ ] (not 100% sure) all inside CanvasItem.visibility\r\n- [ ] Control: rect/pos -> rect_position\r\n- [ ] Control: rect/scale -> rect_scale\r\n- [ ] Control: rect/size -> rect_size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome signals were renamed, so they are not connected/converted:\r\n- [x] Node.enter_tree - > tree_entered\r\n- [x] Node.exit_tree - > tree_exited\r\n- [x] Control.focus_enter -> focus_entered\r\n- [x] Control.focus_exit -> focus_exited\r\n- [x] Control.input_event -> gui_input\r\n- [x] Control.modal_close -> modal_closed\r\n- [x] Control.mouse_enter -> mouse_entered\r\n- [x] Control.mouse_exit -> mouse_exited\r\n- [x] Control.mouse_exit -> mouse_exited\r\n- [x] Control.mouse_exit -> mouse_exited\r\n\r\nThose lists are probably very much incomplete, but I will try to update them when I see something new, also some of those are really easy to fix.  Also I'm not saying all of those NEED to be fixed, but some of them should be for sure, and even if something wont be fixed it's better to be aware since it might be helpful during migration guide doc creation.\r\n\r\nIf you will want to share your own observations always test on the newest 2.0 build. And paste build git hash so we could know what version it was. \r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\nNot very convenient, but if you really want to start with something here is a project in which I was trying to reproduce my issues: [Test2 to 3

should be a way to create a literal primitive in VisualScript. So far as I can tell, this is currently impossible. You first have to create a member or local variable and then you can create a Variable / LocalVarGet node that retrieves it via name. However, it would be nice if I could just make a Literal node, set the type to String (or have respective StringLiteral, IntLiteral, etc. nodes), and then set the value to \"Hello, World\", or even an entire paragraph of content (in a TextEdit).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9648","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9648/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9648/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9648/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9648","id":243100518,"number":9648,"title":"Changed badge to use HTTPS","user":{"login":"mbrickn","id":5591107,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5591107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrickn","html_url":"https://github.com/mbrickn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrickn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrickn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrickn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrickn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrickn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrickn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrickn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrickn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrickn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":283518839,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"ffbbff","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-07-14T20:14:28Z","updated_at":"2017-07-19T16:14:32Z","closed_at":"2017-07-17T10:05:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/9648","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9648","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9648.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9648.patch"},"body":"Really minor change, I just changed the Code Triage badge to use https instead of http since https is available.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time! ^ _ ^","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9648/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9647","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9647/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9647/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9647/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/9647","id":243098314,"number":9647,"title":"Build errors with Bullet physics engine Static Library","user":{"login":"AndreaCatania","id":8342599,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8342599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreaCatania","html_url":"https://github.com/AndreaCatania","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreaCatania/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreaCatania/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreaCatania/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreaCatania/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreaCatania/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreaCatania/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreaCatania/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreaCatania/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreaCatania/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-07-14T20:04:19Z","updated_at":"2017-07-14T22:37:41Z","closed_at":"2017-07-14T22:36:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Windows 64bit -
