system or device - Godot version:**\r\nArchlinux 64-bit with xfce4, using godot_v2.1-stable_x11.64\r\n\r\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\r\nDoing raycast from script, collided with a _CollisionObject_ that had the _'ray_pickable'_ attribute set to false. That obviously shoudn't happen.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nSet an object of any type, let's call it _obj1_, a little higher in the Y-axis from a _CollitionObject_ of any type, let's call it _obj2_, wich has a _CollisionShape_. Now execute this from script:\r\n```\r\nvar obj = get_node(\"obj1\")\r\nvar pos = obj.get_translation()\r\n\t\r\nvar spaceState = get_world().get_direct_space_state()\r\n# Casting from ten units down the Y-axis\r\nvar castResult = spaceState.intersect_ray(pos, pos-Vector3(0, 10, 0))\r\n\t\r\nif not castResult.empty():\r\n\tprint(\"Collision occured\")\r\nelse:\r\n\tprint(\"No collision occured\")\r\n```\r\nAs an extra detail, the issue persists even if you delete the _CollisionShape_ from _obj2_.\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project**:\r\nhttps://bitbucket.org/PaoloBB4/godot-test-raycasting-error\r\nIn this example there are two objects _block1_ and _block2_, colored red and green accordingly and _block2_ is a _StaticBody_ with _'ray_pickable'_ set to false.\r\n\r\nIf collision occures the red block is translated to the point of collision and the message _\"Collition occured\"_ is displayed on output.\r\nOtherwise it remains in place and the message _\"No collition occured\"_ is displayed on output.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7107","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7107/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7107/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7107/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7107","id":188976667,"number":7107,"title":"Some

Not saying Collada support should be dropped but just looking at some facts:\r\n\r\n1. The latest version of Collada was released in August 2008\r\n2. Collada is (was?) developed by a committee of big names like Sony, so contributing to it is not easy\r\n3. Collada is not that popular, even among FLOSS game engines\r\n4. The Blender devs haven't really said if they want to merge BCE or not, but from what I've understood they are on the fence about it because it doesn't have an importer\r\n\r\nExporting to .tscn might be a better idea but the problem is that it is not really an open standard, since there is no formal specification out there and it's directly tied to Godot's implementation, while Collada is, so data between other engines and 3D programs can easily be exchanged (ideally).\r\n\r\nSo I propose a specification for .tscn is written, so that all coders who wish to do so can easily implement .tscn importers and exporters without having to crawl into Godot's source.\r\n\r\nIt would be bad if Godot's excellent 3D capabilities were held back by a third-party format, and it would be even worse if proprietary formats like FBX were adopted, so I say that since .tscn already exists and that it is fine-tuned for being used with Godot, some work should be done to make sure a 3D pipeline can be built around it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7102/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7101","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7101/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7101/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7101/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7101","id":188912488,"number":7101,"title":"Prevent
