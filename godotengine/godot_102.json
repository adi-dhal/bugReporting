Save.\r\nThe console prints errors non-stop.\r\nRemove the \"tool\" keyword. Save. \r\nThe console stops printing errors as tool mode is disabled.\r\nRe-add the \"tool\" keyword. Save. \r\nRestart Godot.\r\nReopen the scene.\r\nTool mode is enabled and working good.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\nhttps://github.com/StraToN/campaines-fish.git\r\nUse the wandering_fishes.tscn scene located in

For example, if you had a scene with the hierarchy:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+ root\r\n|\r\n+-+ dirt\r\n| +- dirt-center\r\n| +- dirt-top\r\n| +- dirt-bottom\r\n|\r\n+-+ grass\r\n| +- grass-1\r\n| +- grass-2\r\n|\r\n+-+ nuclear-barrel\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe TileSet exporter would export only `dirt-center`, `grass-`, and `nuclear-barrel`. This is because of the non-recursive nature of the parser.\r\n\r\n#5816 is potentially related.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n\r\n1. Create a new TileSet scene.\r\n2. Create a hierarchy of nodes.\r\n3. Scene > Convert To > TileSet\r\n4. Most of the nested tiles are missing.\r\n\r\nThe fix for this should be pretty simple.

shadows:\r\n![omnibug](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10215987/26213577/fc331be8-3bcf-11e7-83ac-70f6315195c9.png)\r\n\r\nI refer to the cat eye shaped figure in the shadows, happens with both light modes, cube and dual paraboloid.\r\nMy almost null knowledge on 3D scenes may be a problem here too, these are using default settings.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nJust put an OmniLight over a cube close to the object.\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\n[omnishadow.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/1011639/omnishadow.zip)\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nRotating the shadow gives a more impressive

It's OK for the first alpha if the other platforms don't work yet.\r\n- The editor should be usable, i.e. the basic features should work as expected. The new theme should be polished for a better usability, as it currently has many outstanding usability regressions.\r\n- Rendering features advertised in the progress reports should work. They don't have to be perfect, but they should be usable so that testers can start seeing how the 3.0 will be like (and give feedback to improve it).\r\n- The various outstanding bugs linked to compatibility breakage should be fixed or at least mitigated.\r\n- C# integration is not a requirement for that build. If it's ready, that's great, but it's not a blocker.\r\n- The rendering features planned for 3.0 and not implemented yet can be left for *after* that first build. There are enough outstanding issues to fix before adding new ones.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n## High priority bugs\r\n\r\n- [ ] Asset Library should be able to filter plugins by compatibility with engine version #7147\r\n- [x] Removing a rigidbody and re-adding it to the scene results in errors and the rigidbody disappearing #10074\r\n- [ ] Graphic artifacts in 3d scenes. #10149\r\n- [x] Glow post effect is broken for softlight and screen blend modes (regression from 5567e89) #9106\r\n- [x] Font hinting causing chunky fonts #9441\r\n- [x] Godot freeze computer, when shadow contact set to 1 #9740\r\n- [x] Glow seems to be broken (regression from 772485c) #9797 \r\n- [x] Refraction is broken (regression from 772485c) #9803\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n*Edit:* Previous list, archived on 24 July.\r\n\r\n**High priority bugs**\r\n\r\n- [x] InputEvent's is_action{,_pressed,_released} don't work #8914 \r\n- [x] Keyboard in editor unusable in latest code #8894\r\n- [x] Image -> *.stex conversion is broken since it was made a Resource. #8801\r\n- [x] Names of ClassDB-bound methods changed #8742\r\n- [ ] OBJ files and DAE (better dae) are not imported correctly.
