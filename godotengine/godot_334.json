After opening the project in 1.1.rc2 all rigidbodies2D layers settings had been reset to layer 1. \nHow to replicate this bug:\n- Create a project in pre 1.1rc2 version of the engine. Using UI create a RigidBody2D node and set it's PhysicsBody2D to layers 1,2,3 and 4 for example. Save the project.\n  The project may looks like mine:\n  https://github.com/freemanfromgodotengine/my_repository/blob/master/gfx/ProjectinGodot1.1rc1.png\n- Open the project in Godot1.1.rc2. \n  Look at The RigidBody2D node, that it has a new subproperty called Collision in PhysicsBody2D property and now Layers is set only to layer 1 and a Mask layer 1 (also new feature not present in previous version of Godot).\n  Something like this:\n

The code didn't ran, and while perusing the Input class help on the Godot IDE I noticed that Input.get_mouse_pos() was missing from the class. Is that intended? How should I replace it then? It's a bug? Or an API upgrade?\n\nThanks in advance,\n    Sam \"Mizahnyx\".\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1838/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1837","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1837/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1837/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1837/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/1837","id":73692632,"number":1837,"title":"Audio import problem","user":{"login":"honix","id":11596541,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/11596541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/honix","html_url":"https://github.com/honix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/honix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/honix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/honix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/honix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/honix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/honix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/honix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/honix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/honix/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-05-06T18:02:02Z","updated_at":"2015-11-17T07:33:50Z","closed_at":"2015-11-17T07:33:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"_Bugsquad edit:_ Initially seen on 1.1 rc2.\n\nTrying to import wav audio files.
