I'm trying to get the collision boxes right for each animation. The height of the crouching sprite is at bit less than the standing height, so the collision boxes (using a rectange for now) should be adjuested.\n\nNow, the important thing is, for both standing and crouching animations, the bottom part of the collision rectange should have the same y coordinates (otherwise, crouching could cause a fall down and the character would be \"buried\" into the ground).\n\nHow can I do that with CollisionShape2D (and RectangleShape2D)?\n\nWhen I try to change the height of the collision rectange, it changes both ways in the y-axis. Say, I just finished with the standing animation, and now I'm trying to make the collision rect smaller for crouching animation (without altering the position). Surely, the top part of the collision rect gets lower but at the same time, the bottom part of the collision rectangle gets up!\n\nI know about the pixel snap, but unfortunately, due to the way the way the feet are drawn, collision boxes are not exactly pixel-perfect aligned with the sprites (the sprites look a bit realistic with depth, they're not exactly Mario :)). Which is a problem, because even a single pixel is problem.\n\nIs there an easy/managable way of ensuring the bottom part of the collision box remains at the same y-coordinate?\nIf there was a way of entering the absolute coordinates of the four edges of the rectange in the editor, that would be super nice.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1023","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1023/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1023/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1023/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/1023","id":52608441,"number":1023,"title":"3d

Apparently Fedora by default installs the 32bit version of the libtxc_dxtn and not the 64bit. Forcing the architecture fixed it.\n\nOn a fresh build of Godot on Fedora 21x64 with a Intel 4400. I am having issues with 3D demos - namely both the 3D Platformer and Kinematic Character 3D demos. \n\nBoth lighting and textures look like they're having issues displaying (as you can see in the attached images).\n\nThe only errors in the console are:\n\nERROR: add_node:Condition ' p_type == NODE_OUTPUT ' is true.\nAt: scene/animation/animation_tree_player.cpp:817.\n\nWhen looking at glxinfo I get the following:\n\n GL_ARB_ES2_compatibility, GL_ARB_ES3_compatibility, GL_ARB_base_instance, \n    GL_OES_EGL_image, GL_OES_read_format, GL_S3_s3tc\n    GL_ARB_ES2_compatibility, GL_ARB_ES3_compatibility, \n    GL_OES_read_format, GL_S3_s3tc, GL_SGIS_generate_mipmap, \n\nlibtcx_dxtn is installed.\n\n![screenshot from 2014-12-18 20 54 23](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2192159/5500034/fd5f8882-86f8-11e4-8386-76cc4a760c2b.png)\n![screenshot from 2014-12-18 20 20 22](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2192159/5500033/fd5a96b0-86f8-11e4-8f28-a01833d65dcb.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/997/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4632","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"DC2B:572C:153054C:2A128F9:59D69FF0","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=363>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=361>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"a9efff7292102d94b07bc85564dbc68c\"","status":"200 OK"}}
