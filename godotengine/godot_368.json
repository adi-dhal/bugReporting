I hope these features make it before version 1.0 is released.\n1.  brush sizes: Changing the brush size would be useful if you need to paint large extensions of your TileMap node.\n2.  search by name TileSet palette: You have to scroll up or down to find the tile you want to use for painting, by writing the name of the tile you want you could narrow the collection of tiles shown to find the one you need, quickly.\n3.  rectangular drawing: By clicking a place and dragging the mouse, making a rectangle, the user can paint large extensions of the TileMap node at will.\n4.  eraser sizes and rectangular deleting: like feature 1 and 3 but for erasing things from your TileMap.\n5.  Terrain Tool: This is a feature on Tiled. As they explain it in [their wiki](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/wiki/Using-the-Terrain-Tool): _Starting with Tiled 0.9.0, a new tool was added specifically to make editing tile maps easier when using terrain transitions. There are of course multiple ways to do transitions between tiles. The Terrain tool in Tiled supports transition tiles that have a well-defined terrain type at each of their 4 corners, which seems to be the most common method._\n6.  random tiles, a brush mode: A mode that allows the brush to use many different tiles to paint randomly an area of TileMap, Tiled have a brush specifically for this, but I think that allowing this to be use in both feature request 3 besides the usual brush (but able to change its size as asked in feature request 1) is way better.\n7.  Automapping: This is another feature on Tiled. Again, as they explain it in [their wiki](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/wiki/Automapping#what-is-automapping): _Automapping is an advanced tool to automatically search certain combinations of tiles across layers in a map and to replace these parts by other combination. This allows the user to draw structures with a minimum of time spent and the Automapping will be able to generate a rather complex scenario, which would need lots more time if manually crafted. So the goal of Automapping is that you only need to draw within one layer and everything else is setup for you. This brings some advantages:_\n   -   _working speed - you need less time to setup a map._\n   -   _less errors - the main reason is to reduce the error rate. If you have setup the rules properly, there is no hidden error._\n8.  Stamp brush tool: another feature from Tiled, you can select many different tiles and paint such selection, as is, to paint the TileMap node. In Tiled you can [create brushes](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/wiki/Best-Practices#creating-a-brush) (so you don't have to repeatedly select different groups of tiles).\n\ndon't forget to tag this issue as \"whishlist\".

there. So the problem is that ambient lighting only affects objects lit by existing lights, like Omni or Directional lights. This can be seen in the screenshot I've attached - the point light lights up the tiles near it, correctly, but the Ambient Light only brightens the light level of objects in the bounding box of the Omni Light.\n\n![ambientlightingissues](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4733521/4802284/66791e90-5e41-11e4-8ffb-cd47a1a330e3.png)\n\nThis can actually easily be confirmed by just making a scene, making a WorldEnvironment node, and giving some Ambient Lighting - it won't do anything to the scene unless you add another light.\n\nThe engine's turning out really well, nonetheless. Thanks a lot for development.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/834/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/833","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/833/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/833/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/833/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/833","id":46969797,"number":833,"title":"GDScript:
