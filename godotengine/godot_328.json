This issue was raised in https://github.com/okamstudio/godot/issues/72, but after promises were made, nothing has changed.\n- Another issue is the low quality of existing pieces of documentation. For example, the Physics and Collision (2D) tutorial doesn't explain how to use the collision triggers _at all_, it just mentions their existence and the developer is left to reverse engineer the rest with the use of example projects and forum posts.\n- Some code is completely undocumented. An example would be the Path2D and PathFollow2D classes. What exactly are they meant to do? How does the developer use them?\n\nThe documentation has to be complete and up to date if the engine is meant to be usable.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2032/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2031","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2031/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2031/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2031/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2031","id":85060665,"number":2031,"title":"Stereoscopic rendering","user":{"login":"unfa","id":491704,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/491704?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/unfa","html_url":"https://github.com/unfa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unfa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unfa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unfa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unfa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unfa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unfa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unfa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unfa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unfa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-06-04T11:51:50Z","updated_at":"2015-06-12T05:55:52Z","closed_at":"2015-06-12T05:55:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Since Google Cardbord has appeared, more and more companies produce alike devices to make cheap VR-like experience availabile.\n\nI wonder if it'd be possible for Godot to render stereoscopic images?\n\nSeveral technologies are availabile:\n\nSide-by-side straigth (for Google Cartboard like mounts) -

But i'll paste the crashlog here, someone more knowledgeable might give advice.\nThe external soundcard is Motu UltraLite MK3 Hybrid. It is connected wiht Firewire 400 to my computer (in a FW 800 port, there is an HDD chained - the HDD doesn't seem to be any problem). \nIf the soundcard is on ; then Godot crashes on launch. If i turn it on while Godot is running, Godot will crash.\nFor some time i have been using this soundcard with Godot without problem. One day it began crashing. Other potential culprits : Jack Audio connection kit, a Oxygen 61 MIDI keyboard, LinuxSampler, Apple XCode or commandline tools update. I installed several things at some point, and after that Godot began crashing as described.\n\n```\nProcess:               Godot [839]\nPath:                  /Users/USER/Documents/*/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot\nIdentifier:            com.okamstudio.godot\nVersion:               1.0.0 (1.0.0)\nCode Type:             X86 (Native)\nParent Process:        ???

Following [the wiki](https://github.com/okamstudio/godot/wiki/tutorial_gdscript_efficiently#pointers--referencing), I wrote some code modifying a RawArray thinking it would affect outside code, since arrays are said to be passed by reference. I found this is not the case:\n\nThis is the code I was testing:\n\n``` gdscript\nstatic func set_uint32(buff, value):\n   print(\"in function:\")\n   print(buff.get(0), \", \", buff.get(1), \", \", buff.get(2), \", \", buff.get(3))\n\n   buff.set(0, (value >> 24) & 0xFF)\n   buff.set(1, (value >> 16) & 0xFF)\n   buff.set(2, (value >>  8) & 0xFF)\n   buff.set(3, (value >>  0) & 0xFF)\n\n   print(buff.get(0), \", \", buff.get(1), \", \", buff.get(2), \", \", buff.get(3))\n   print(\"end of function\")\n\nfunc some_important_function():\n   # starts here\n   var arr = RawArray()\n   for i in range(4):\n      arr.push_back(255)\n\n   print(\"outside:\")\n   print(arr.get(0), \", \", arr.get(1), \", \", arr.get(2), \", \", arr.get(3))\n   set_uint32(arr, 500)\n   print(\"outside again:\")\n   print(arr.get(0), \", \", arr.get(1), \", \", arr.get(2), \", \", arr.get(3))\n```\n\n...which produced this output:\n\n```\noutside:\n255, 255, 255, 255\nin function:\n255, 255, 255, 255\n0, 0, 1, 244\nend of function\noutside again:\n255, 255, 255, 255\n```\n\nThis shows the array remained unmodified after the function was run.\n\nAs [Brice pointed out](http://www.godotengine.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=2062#p9795) in [the thread I started](http://www.godotengine.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=2062), the code above works if you swap the arr declaration from `var arr = RawArray()` to `var arr = []` and adapt the code accordingly. If you use `var arr = Array()` instead, you're back at the original behaviour.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2021/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2020","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2020/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2020/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2020/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2020","id":83876497,"number":2020,"title":"add_child
