The answer is: the developer will be able to more flexibly plan the development of the game. For example: we have started to develop the game at 2.0, and we know that in six months there will be version 2.1 with a feature we required. The developer knows whether he has time to move to a new stable version of the engine or whether it needs to implement this feature on their own or even to abandon it.

That way the script editor can show a meaningful name for it in the open scripts list. That is, instead of the cryptic and difficult to identify `GDScript(NNNNN)` now it will appear as `OwnerNodeName <Built-In>`.\n\nUser still has the option of giving an explicit name to the internal script resource and it will appear instead, but this change makes it a lot less needed.\n\nThe naming algorithm still will have to resort to the old notation in cases when the owner object is no longer present; e.g., when the scene has been closed but the script is still open in the editor.\n\nOverall this makes easier to work with built-in scripts. I find them more convenient when a small amount of code is needed for a node in order to balance filesystem pollution against scene file complexity.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5356/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5355","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5355/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5355/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5355/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5355","id":161607932,"number":5355,"title":"iOS simulator: merge into iphone detect.py","user":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279097519,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:ios","name":"platform:ios","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279098009,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:buildsystem","name":"topic:buildsystem","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-06-22T07:03:27Z","updated_at":"2016-06-23T06:18:50Z","closed_at":"2016-06-23T06:18:49Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/5355","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5355","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5355.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5355.patch"},"body":"**Please test,** as I did not.
