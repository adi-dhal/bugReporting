opening this because the v3 API changes issue is close... or I don't know which one is currently open.\r\n\r\nThe `AnimationPlayer` node has these signals:\r\n\r\n- `animation_changed(String old_name, String new_name)`\r\n- `animation_started(String name)`\r\n- `finished()`\r\n\r\nWhen auto generating functions for these signals through the GUI we'd end up with names like `_on_AnimationPlayer_animation_started` etc. Kind of an overkill. I propose these be changed in v3 to:\r\n\r\n- `changed(String old_name, String new_name)`\r\n- `started(String name)`\r\n- `finished(String name)` <- also include info on which animation finished playing\r\n- `finished_all()` <- as per @bebae's comment in #7444. I didn't know that `finished` is emitted after ALL animations are finished playing. So basically the old `finished` would become `finished_all` or something like that and the new `finished(String name)` will behave as `started(String name)`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7682/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7681","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7681/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7681/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7681/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7681","id":204007245,"number":7681,"title":"corrected ClassDB::instance() return type","user":{"login":"karroffel","id":5209613,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5209613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karroffel","html_url":"https://github.com/karroffel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karroffel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karroffel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karroffel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karroffel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karroffel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karroffel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karroffel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karroffel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karroffel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-01-30T13:14:38Z","updated_at":"2017-04-23T23:53:55Z","closed_at":"2017-02-02T07:15:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/7681","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7681","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7681.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7681.patch"},"body":"The return type was `void` which is wrong, it's Variant.
