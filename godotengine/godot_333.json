For a reference on how the polygon should be shrinked, here is a link:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/1109536/an-algorithm-for-inflating-deflating-offsetting-buffering-polygons\nThis would allow perfect movement of units that have different dimensions (X * Y) without colliding at walls/edges. Also, if the polygon gets shrunk, paths that are too small to pass would be automatically collapsed and removed from consideration.\n\nAvoidance of collision with other units / objects that are currently standing still or collide with the moving unit would be nice to have too. An idea would be to check the current path segment the unit is moving at, if this segment is intersecting with an idling unit/object and if so, find an alternative path for this segment.\nSome considerations and further readings about this collision avoidance with other units can be found in this link under the \"Notes on implementation\" section at \"1. Other Units (collision avoidance)\" subsection: http://www.policyalmanac.org/games/aStarTutorial.htm\n\nSadly I'm too noob to directly help with code I guess, but I would still like to help as much as I can with testing or anything else if this gets implemented.\nThanks in

**Implemented support for fixed process on timer** \n  This is useful for cooldowns without the influence from framerate.\n  The implementation is similar to animation player (idle/fixed mode), where idle mode = old timer, fixed mode = fixed process implementation:\n  Example of the new behaviour with a stream of bullets with timers for each shoot on different frame rates:\n  https://gfycat.com/HeartyImpressiveIndiancow\n- **A change for more uniform ticks on fixed/idle**\n  without this fix:\n  ![0tmq6cg

(time_left<0) {\n>             if (!one_shot)\n>                 time_left=wait_time+time_left; //this line changed for: time_left = wait_time;\n>             else\n>                 stop();\n>             emit_signal(\"timeout\");\n>         }\n> ```\n\nThe reason for the change is:\nWith _time_left=wait_time+time_left;_ method: the algorithm takes on account the remaining ms from last tick for the next one, so not all ticks are the same\nWith _time_left = wait_time;_ method: the algorithm discards the remaining ms, so all the ticks are the same\n\nExample of the old behaviour with a timer of 0.04 ms on a fixed framerate of 60 (~0,016 ms):\n\n> 0,0\n> 0,016\n> 0,032\n> 0,048\n> ----- TICK on 4 frames\n> 0,008\n> 0,024\n> 0,040\n> ----- TICK on 3 frames\n> 0,0\n> 0,016\n> 0,032\n> 0,048\n> ----- TICK on 4 frames\n\nSo every second tick is more fastest, resulting on non uniform behaviour between all ticks, On the fix, all the ticks start with the same value, so is always the same result (4 frames)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1878","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1878/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1878/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1878/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/1878","id":74822074,"number":1878,"title":"Remove
