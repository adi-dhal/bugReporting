The problem with that solution is that you loose a lot of time doing it if your game runs on a device, or if you have to run a long series of actions in the game before reaching the point where the bug is (not to mention asynchronous or time-dependent tasks where breaking would prevent an action from being repro-ed correctly). Also, script hot-reloading is not always an option because it could be risky, and it doesn't even works well on my own game.\r\n\r\n**The idea**\r\nThe idea is that a breakpoint could also, instead of breaking, print a message, retrieve the stack, or display the value of available variables. Or eventually break if a condition is fullfilled. This alternative doesn't requires code modifications and would be very fast to setup.\r\n\r\nNow I don't necessarily need it currently, but maybe others could be interested by the idea. I use a similar feature in Visual Studio on a daily basis due to the complexity of the project, and it saves a significant amount of time.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6576/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6575","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6575/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6575/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6575/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/6575","id":178336825,"number":6575,"title":"More

system or device - Godot version:**\nAny platform, Godot 2.1\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\n\nI may be approaching my node hierarchy design incorrectly in which case feedback is welcome, but I think there may be an interesting feature possibility based on the little bit of experience that I have.\n\nI think it would be interesting if there was a way for a parent node to promote specific properties of its children, so that when the parent is instanced into a scene that those child properties could be set directly for that instance, rather than replicated from parent to children by script. \n\nAn example...\n\nI've created a Player scene hierarchy that I instantiate into my scene for each game player. Right now my player scene looks like\n\n```\n player (RigidBody2D)\n  - Sprite\n  - CollisionPolygon2D\n  - control_move(Node)\n```\n\n`control_move` is just a node with a script attached that implements simple controls, it exposes a variable `player_speed`,`player_number`. Its `player_number` is used to build an Input name unique to that player's controls. I may move this in to a plugin later.\n\nRight now my player parent node _also_ has to expose `player_number`, and it has to pass this along at initialization to its child. Player parent also exposes an `extern (Texture) texture` which it passes along to the Sprite child:\n\n``` godot\nfunc _ready():\n    get_node(\"Sprite\").set_texture(texture)\n    control.player_number = player_number\n```\n\nIn a perfect world, `player` could simply promote the texture of `Sprite` and `player_number` from those child nodes, so that when instanced I could set those properties on player and then I wouldn't need any script at all in player - the engine would transparently reference the actual property for me. \n\nAs for implementation - well that I am not qualified to say but perhaps a dynamic script object would have to be created for the parent class, and any user defined script would have to subclass that. Probably not nearly as simple as the idea is - but any alternative ideas are welcome.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6571/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":3,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6570","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6570/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6570/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6570/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6570","id":178210508,"number":6570,"title":"In

[dependency graph](http://screencast.com/t/l3rIyXkt9gN9)\n\nI am also currently testing with normal clang without the wrapper. I'll edit this as soon as I have some results (seems that CXX variabile is not taken in count when using mingw).\n\nEDIT: seems that clang on Windows (LLVM official) is more tied to Visual Studio than MinGW.

IINW, you plan to use `double` instead of `float` in 3.0. I guess you will use `real_t` and the `REAL_T_IS_DOUBLE` macro for this.
