values in GDScript are of type NIL so not allowing null\r\ncomparisons did end up breaking some code.\r\n\r\nThis commit reenables NULL equality checks for all types. We're going to\r\nhave to figure out how to make this fast for the compiler later.\r\n\r\nFixes #11430.\r\n\r\nThe original complaint about this was something like this: (but to do with input) https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/pull/66\r\n\r\n```gdscript\r\nfunc _ready():\r\n  var x \r\n  while true:\r\n    if x < 10:\r\n      x = 10\r\n      break\r\n```\r\nAllowing you to treat an uninitialized value as something of any type for this case, of course initializing the value fixes that.\r\n\r\nThis makes the following valid GDScript:\r\n```gdscript\r\nfunc _ready():\r\n        var x\r\n\r\n        if x == null: # x is null or unitialized\r\n                x = 10\r\n\r\n        if x != null:\r\n                print(\"not null now\")\r\n\r\n        print(x)\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust to clarify: This is valid GDScript2, but after the stricter type checking was no longer valid GDScript3. The question is do we want the above code to be valid GDScript or not.\r\n\r\nIf this PR is not merged the above can be achieved as follows:\r\n\r\n```gdscript\r\nfunc _ready():\r\n    var x\r\n    if not x: # X 0 or unitialized\r\n      x = 10\r\n\r\n   if x:\r\n      print(\"not null or 0\")\r\n\r\n   print(x)\r\n```\r\nor just initialize (and thereby type) the variable. If you really must know whether something is initialized vs 0 a typeof() can still work, but even then does that mean 'initialized' or not?\r\n\r\nThere's a case to be made here to just make unitialized variables a syntax error too I suppose.

A magic mouse's touch scroll zooms excessively in the visual editor.  Any minor scroll gestures cause the editor to zoom by several thousand percent.  This makes using the mouse a hinderance on macOS as even accidentally smudging your finger can unexpectedly throw the editor (and you) way off.  \r\n\r\n2. The script editor is similarly too sensitive, and scrolls too readily (though it's manageable, possibly as a side effect of 3 below).  \r\n\r\n3. Script editor fling gestures behave strangely, with the editor scrolling at a consistent rate before abruptly stopping.   I would expect the fling scrolling velocity to start fast and gradually tail off.  See scrolling in other macOS apps for example expected behaviour.\r\n\r\nOther apps, such as Unity, are able to support the mouse's touch events seamlessly (in fact I'd look to Unity for an example of expected zoom behaviour).\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nOpen godot's 2D editor.  Interact with the surface of the mouse.  The editor will zoom almost uncontrollably.\r\n\r\nOpen godot's script editor.  Attempt to scroll a line or two at a time.  Use a fling gesture to scroll down a large file.\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example

This fixes this font size jumping.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11421/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11420","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11420/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11420/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11420/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/11420","id":258847343,"number":11420,"title":"Less strict equality checks","user":{"login":"jjay","id":122736,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/122736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjay","html_url":"https://github.com/jjay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjay/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false},{"id":279097162,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/discussion","name":"discussion","color":"ee77ee","default":false},{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":9,"created_at":"2017-09-19T14:43:18Z","updated_at":"2017-09-19T18:20:48Z","closed_at":"2017-09-19T18:09:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/11420","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/11420","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/11420.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/11420.patch"},"body":"What happens without this PR - in most cases an error is generated - `Invalid operands 'int' and 'String' in operator '=='`.

I believe equality checks should not generate any errors, this is completely unexcepted behaviour, especially for such dynamicaly typed language as GDScript. I won't receive any errors just for asking is Monkey the same thing as Banana. I want false result in this case. Python (for example) is OK with equality checks of different types. In most cases this is matter of aesthetics, but if we think about how external data can be changed over time equality checks behaviour becomes incredibly important.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11419","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11419/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11419/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11419/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/11419","id":258840013,"number":11419,"title":"string.split

web socket support is planned yet? i know a lot of work has been don with 3.0, but i'm currently wanting to use the [uws nodejs](https://github.com/uNetworking/bindings/tree/master/nodejs) library (**fastest** websocket lib for nodejs), and really want to use Godot with it!!\r\n\r\ni have a large game i made in html 5 that uses that library but don't really want to mess with TCP and doing my own message protocol solution.  but, game is around 10,000 lines of code and already converting it over to Godot now with the beautiful `gdscript` language. really easy coming from javascript tbh :)
