(this is the case with MSVC2015)\n\nSo,\nI've replaced `rand()` with a RNG from the standard c++11 `random` library ([`#include <random>`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/random/mt19937/)) : \n- each thread has its own RNG which is seeded with a 100% random seed.\n- noisy-cloudy patterns are smoothed faster\n- the `RAND_MAX` is unsigned 2^32\n\n(i'll publish the patch later)\n\nHere are two screenshots to compare.\n**Top** is standard `rand()`, **bottom** is thread seeded `std::mt19937` RNG.\n\nBoth are baked for 15 minutes at around 201.500 rays/s on 3 threads ( Editor Settings / Light Baker / Custom Bake Threads = 3 ), and a plot size of 2.5.\n\n![baked_light_baker_c_rand](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9801802/19022379/cfe8e80c-88d7-11e6-8926-6c64c1021c7d.png)\n\n![baked_light_baker_mt_rand](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9801802/19022380/d583a572-88d7-11e6-94c8-7365108483d5.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6682/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6681","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6681/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6681/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6681/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6681","id":180523615,"number":6681,"title":"Building AppImages for Godot editor and (maybe) games","user":{"login":"Calinou","id":180032,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/180032?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou","html_url":"https://github.com/Calinou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279097326,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:linux","name":"platform:linux","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-10-02T17:28:43Z","updated_at":"2016-10-04T19:55:40Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It would be awesome if [AppImages](http://appimage.org/) could be created for the Godot editor (for distribution of official or unofficial builds) and maybe exported games.\n\nThe goal of AppImages is to make portable Linux binaries easy. No dependencies need to be installed for users; think of it as macOS' .app, but for Linux, it's essentially an application bundle which can also provide basic system integration (such as menus and icons).\n## What needs to be done\n- Gather a list of all required libraries that are not linked statically to Godot. This can be figured out using `ldd` for example. [Beware as some libraries should never be included in an AppImage.](https://github.com/probonopd/AppImages/blob/master/excludelist)\n- Automate the creation of editor AppImages using SCons (or shell scripts). For this, a template AppDir must be created first, and put in the Godot Git repository (just like the macOS template). A script should be provided for copying system libraries to the AppDir.\n- Document the AppImage creation process.\n- Provide official AppImages as the recommended way of running Godot on Linux, for 64-bit and 32-bit. Some instructions should be provided as well (users still need to `chmod +x` them).\n## Additional tasks\n- What should be done for games? I don't think it's feasible to export AppImages from a non-Linux system, but this needs to be confirmed. Perhaps we can provide a script that converts a Linux export to an AppImage.\n## Resources\n- [Documentation on creating AppImages](https://github.com/probonopd/AppImageKit#creating-appimages)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6681/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6680","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6680/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6680/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6680/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6680","id":180514677,"number":6680,"title":"Shadows misplaced when spotlight is arbitrarly oriented","user":{"login":"m4nu3lf","id":5478365,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5478365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4nu3lf","html_url":"https://github.com/m4nu3lf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4nu3lf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4nu3lf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4nu3lf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4nu3lf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4nu3lf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4nu3lf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4nu3lf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4nu3lf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m4nu3lf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279098111,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:rendering","name":"topic:rendering","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-10-02T14:24:17Z","updated_at":"2016-10-06T16:51:45Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Operating system or device -

Now, retry with an older version, and see it doesn't happen there (good luck :wink:)\r\n\r\n**GDB backtraces:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n#0  0x00000000015e655c in Space2DSW::get_body_angular_velocity_sleep_treshold (this=0x0) at servers/physics_2d/space_2d_sw.h:162\r\n#1  0x00000000015e4c63 in Body2DSW::sleep_test (this=0x5b99040, p_step=0.0166666675) at servers/physics_2d/body_2d_sw.cpp:642\r\n#2  0x00000000015ee3e2 in Step2DSW::_check_suspend (this=0x341c270, p_island=0x5b99040, p_delta=0.0166666675) at servers/physics_2d/step_2d_sw.cpp:110\r\n#3  0x00000000015eeacc in Step2DSW::step (this=0x341c270, p_space=0x3946120, p_delta=0.0166666675, p_iterations=8) at servers/physics_2d/step_2d_sw.cpp:308\r\n#4  0x00000000015da3f5 in Physics2DServerSW::step (this=0x34204e0, p_step=0.0166666675) at servers/physics_2d/physics_2d_server_sw.cpp:1277\r\n#5  0x0000000001664df5 in Physics2DServerWrapMT::step (this=0x7fffe8265030, p_step=0.0166666675) at servers/physics_2d/physics_2d_server_wrap_mt.cpp:86\r\n#6  0x00000000004327bf in Main::iteration () at main/main.cpp:1587\r\n#7  0x0000000000416311 in OS_X11::run (this=0x7fffffffe020) at platform/x11/os_x11.cpp:1921\r\n#8  0x000000000040e9f0 in main (argc=1, argv=0x7fffffffe538) at platform/x11/godot_x11.cpp:41\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#0  0x00000000015edbfb in Comparator<Constraint2DSW*>::operator() (this=0x7fffffffd927, p_a=@0x7fffffffd9b0: 0x4acb980, p_b=@0xc4a3b5dc00000030: <error reading variable>)\r\n    at core/typedefs.h:268\r\n#1  0x00000000015ed40c in Map<Constraint2DSW*, int, Comparator<Constraint2DSW*>, DefaultAllocator>::_find (this=0x52d7960, p_key=@0x7fffffffd9b0: 0x4acb980) at core/map.h:248\r\n#2  0x00000000015ed072 in Map<Constraint2DSW*, int, Comparator<Constraint2DSW*>, DefaultAllocator>::find (this=0x52d7960, p_key=@0x7fffffffd9b0: 0x4acb980) at core/map.h:560\r\n#3  0x00000000015eceeb in Map<Constraint2DSW*, int, Comparator<Constraint2DSW*>, DefaultAllocator>::operator[] (this=0x52d7960, p_key=@0x7fffffffd9b0: 0x4acb980) at core/map.h:627\r\n#4  0x00000000015eccdd in Body2DSW::add_constraint (this=0x52d77f0, p_constraint=0x4acb980, p_pos=1) at servers/physics_2d/body_2d_sw.h:188\r\n#5  0x000000000168bb42 in BodyPair2DSW::BodyPair2DSW (this=0x4acb980, p_A=0x42f18a0, p_shape_A=0, p_B=0x52d77f0, p_shape_B=0) at servers/physics_2d/body_pair_2d_sw.cpp:537\r\n#6  0x00000000016868b6 in Space2DSW::_broadphase_pair (A=0x42f18a0, p_subindex_A=0, B=0x52d77f0, p_subindex_B=0, p_self=0x3945f90) at servers/physics_2d/space_2d_sw.cpp:1129\r\n#7  0x000000000167bcfc in BroadPhase2DHashGrid::_check_motion (this=0x3911fc0, p_elem=0x41c1398) at servers/physics_2d/broad_phase_2d_hash_grid.cpp:89\r\n#8  0x000000000167cd82 in BroadPhase2DHashGrid::move (this=0x3911fc0, p_id=2793, p_aabb=...) at servers/physics_2d/broad_phase_2d_hash_grid.cpp:384\r\n#9  0x00000000015e88c4 in CollisionObject2DSW::_update_shapes (this=0x42f18a0) at servers/physics_2d/collision_object_2d_sw.cpp:158\r\n#10 0x00000000015e54f8 in CollisionObject2DSW::_set_transform (this=0x42f18a0, p_transform=..., p_update_shapes=true) at servers/physics_2d/collision_object_2d_sw.h:80\r\n#11 0x00000000015e47f1 in Body2DSW::integrate_velocities (this=0x42f18a0, p_step=0.0166666675) at servers/physics_2d/body_2d_sw.cpp:562\r\n#12 0x00000000015eea86 in Step2DSW::step (this=0x341c170, p_space=0x3945f90, p_delta=0.0166666675, p_iterations=8) at servers/physics_2d/step_2d_sw.cpp:298\r\n#13 0x00000000015da3f5 in Physics2DServerSW::step (this=0x34203e0, p_step=0.0166666675) at servers/physics_2d/physics_2d_server_sw.cpp:1277\r\n#14 0x0000000001664df5 in Physics2DServerWrapMT::step (this=0x7fffe8265030, p_step=0.0166666675) at servers/physics_2d/physics_2d_server_wrap_mt.cpp:86\r\n#15 0x00000000004327bf in Main::iteration () at main/main.cpp:1587\r\n#16 0x0000000000416311 in OS_X11::run (this=0x7fffffffe020) at platform/x11/os_x11.cpp:1921\r\n#17 0x000000000040e9f0 in main (argc=1, argv=0x7fffffffe538) at platform/x11/godot_x11.cpp:41\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#0  0x0000000001687290 in CollisionObject2DSW::get_type (this=0x13e013600) at servers/physics_2d/collision_object_2d_sw.h:98\r\n#1  0x0000000001686734 in Space2DSW::_broadphase_pair (A=0x461f640, p_subindex_A=0, B=0x13e013600, p_subindex_B=-1057153242, p_self=0x3945ed0) at servers/physics_2d/space_2d_sw.cpp:1099\r\n[didn't save rest :/]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Bisect output:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git bisect log\r\ngit bisect start 'servers'\r\n# bad: [dabcabe9815612c7ef1c99909b14d632f13df165] Merge pull request #6658 from Faless/fix_bo_network\r\ngit bisect bad dabcabe9815612c7ef1c99909b14d632f13df165\r\n# good: [9e2b9f8cb1c34fe7c3aa91bdd7f40ebb6a1a318f] bump to stable, congratulations everyone\r\ngit bisect good 9e2b9f8cb1c34fe7c3aa91bdd7f40ebb6a1a318f\r\n# good: [64b4253dbfe3fdfc4efa405086d23765a9774d91] changed visual server free() to free_rid() like in the other servers.
