Godot 2.1\r\n\r\nI set the rotation of a Camera to `(0, 180, 0)` in the editor.\r\nBut if I print `get_rotation()` in `_ready()`, I get `(-3.141593, -0, -3.141593)`, which in degrees is `(-180, 0, -180)`.\r\nEDIT: if I close and repoen the scene, the inspector now shows `(-180, 0, -180)` in the rotation field as well.\r\n\r\nI understand the angles technically represent the same orientation, however I didn't expected that, and I'm confused about how to initialize my FPS lookat now.\r\n\r\nI have a [camera script](https://github.com/Zylann/voxelgame/blob/master/project/debug_camera.gd#L75) that has its own `yaw` and `pitch` (the latter being clamped), and these need to represent the initial rotation of the camera when the game starts, and it obviously won't work given the funky values `get_rotation()` returns.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to initialize the rotations properly?

I still have some doubts about how to do things the Godot way (see my questions below), but overall this is the design I'd personally like to see in the engine.\r\n\r\nIt is used like this:\r\n\r\n```gdscript\r\nvar rng = RandPCG32.new()   # Or another RNG class, like Xoroshiro128Plus\r\nrng.seed(1234)  # rng.randomize() also exists\r\n\r\nn = rng.uniform_float(-1.0, 2.0) # uniform in interval [-1.0, 2.0]\r\nn = rng.uniform_int(1, 6) # six-sided die\r\nn = rng.boolean(0.1)  # 10% of chance of being true\r\nn = rng.normal(-3.0, 2.0)  # Gaussian, mean = -3, std. deviation = 2.0\r\nn = rng.exponential(2.0) # from exponential distribution with mean = 2.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe the current random number generation facilities in Godot are good for simple use cases (and I'd say that they should remain available), but more \"interesting\" RNG usage needs something new. I had three main goals in mind:\r\n\r\n1) Add a few more useful distributions beyond uniform.\r\n\r\n2) Let the user create separate instances of the RNG algorithm, in order to generate different independent sequences (pretty useful for procedural generation of content).\r\n\r\n3) Allow users to be sure that they can create reproducible pseudorandom sequences even between Godot releases.\r\n\r\nThe biggest open points and questions I still have are:\r\n\r\n* Do you consider this design in general good for Godot?\r\n   * One sub-question here: What about providing multiple RNG algorithms as I did? I think that choosing a RNG is a trade-off, so I like the idea of providing the alternatives and letting the user chose one. Providing one single `Rand` class would be simpler (which is good), but if we ever decide to replace the one algorithm with something else, my point 3 above is not achieved. And I like RNG algorithms, so my opinion *is* biassed :-)\r\n* How to add tests for this? I am currently using a Godot project (https://github.com/lmbarros/GodotRandTest/ -- it is currently quite ugly, BTW) that calls my methods from GDScript and checks if the results are OK. However, in order to be able to make these tests, I was required to expose `Rand::random()` to GDScript, which otherwise I wouldn't.\r\n* Sometimes it is useful to save the RNG state with a saved game (to avoid the save-reload-and-try-again \"cheat\"). I am a Godot beginner, so I don't know if there is any support or standard way for doing serialization or save games.\r\n* The newer versions of the C++ standard have implementations of various RNG algorithms and random distributions. For some reason that beyond my own understanding I haven't used them here. Is the usage of these newer parts of the C++ standard library allowed or encouraged in Godot?\r\n* I implemented this on Linux and didn't test anywhere else. There is nothing platform-specific here, but we may need to tweak the implementation a bit to make it compile everywhere.\r\n \r\n----\r\n\r\nSix RNG algorithms are provided: PCG32, Xoroshiro128+, two variations of\r\nMersenne Twister (MT19937 and MT19937-64), SplitMix64 and a simple LCG.\r\nDifferent random distributions are provided: uniform (for integers and\r\nfloats), normal (Gaussian), exponential and Bernoulli (for generating\r\nBooleans).\r\n\r\nAll algorithms and distributions are usable from GDScript.\r\n\r\nThe base `Rand` class contains the interface that must be implemented by\r\nall RNG algorithms and the implementation of the different\r\ndistributions. Subclasses that implement each of the actual RNG\r\nalgorithms inherit the distributions. This way, new algorithms and new\r\ndistributions can be easily added, and every algorithm can be used with\r\nevery distribution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7989/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7988","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7988/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7988/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7988/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7988","id":212902775,"number":7988,"title":"Several
