It has a Label, an Icon, a Panel, and a Polygon2D for the outline that appears on hover. User RMB clicks on certain parameters in these Nodes and chooses 'Expose' - an icon appears next to them to indicate that they are exposed. The user does it with Label text, Icon texture, and Panel and Polygon2D's colors. The value that they have in this scene will be the default value for these parameters.\r\n\r\nNext, the user goes to the 'Main Menu' scene and instances the 'Custom Button' scene multiple times. Each instance has a new parameters section, in addition to the regular parameters, called Exposed Parameters. The exposed parameters are listed there, and set to the default values. User can then set unique values for these parameters for each 'Custom Button' scene instance, or reset them to the default value.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOther usecases could be all kinds of instances that share some properties, and have other properties that are unique - widgets, tiles, power-ups, environment elements, character elements etc.\r\n\r\nFor a working example of this system check Substance Designer, which also has nodes and parameters exposing - though it's not perfect (I can clarify what could be improved there if needed).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10586","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10586/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10586/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10586/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/10586","id":252329472,"number":10586,"title":"AnimatedSprite

is an `ease` function in GDScript, but when I read its documentation I was a bit confused:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    float ease ( float s, float curve )\r\n\r\nEasing function, based on exponent. 0 is constant, 1 is linear, 0 to 1 is ease-in, 1+ is ease out.
