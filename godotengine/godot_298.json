So it should be: SCN, RES, TSCN, TRES, XSCN, XML.\n- For both dialogs, if we want users to start using T-formats preferentially over XML formats, maybe the XML formats could be removed altogether from the \"All recognized\" shortlist (but kept as available filters of course).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2946/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2945","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2945/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2945/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2945/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2945","id":119350247,"number":2945,"title":"display
