system or device - Godot version:**\r\n\r\nOS: Manjaro 17.0.1 Gellivara\r\nKernel: x86_64 Linux 4.9.24-1-MANJARO\r\nCPU: Intel Celeron G1840 @ 2x 2.8GHz\r\nGPU: Mesa DRI Intel(R) Haswell Desktop\r\n\r\nGodot 2.1.3.stable.official\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nUsing the 3D editor proves to be incredibly obnoxious when a huge mesh (or even something just big) is present in the scene. \r\n\r\nThe zooms become useless for placing small objecs, because the closer you get, the less the view zooms. That makes, for instance, placing vegetation on a large terrain almos imposible. \r\n\r\nOrbiting also has a similar issue. The radius the view uses to orbit around is way too broad, so orbiting around a patch of grass is again almost imposible.\r\n\r\nConsidering the new gles3 release will receive a lot of attention on the 3D engine it has to be fixed ASAP, or it might dissapoint pretty much anyone trying for anything but a very minimal FPS.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if report this as a bug, because I'm not sure it is a bug either. Is this the intended behavior?\r\n\r\nAlso, I suggest implementing something similar to Blender navigation. Use the selected object or the object under the mouse pointer as pivot point and zoom/orbit target.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n- Load a big terrain mesh (scale x50 in Blender).\r\n- Load a small plant mesh or other prop, then try to operate on it (scale 1 in Blender).\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\nI can provide one if needed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8655/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8654","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8654/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8654/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8654/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/8654","id":226590225,"number":8654,"title":"Spotlights
