Description:\r\nWhen add an new scene named Barrier (an StaticBody2D with a sub child collision shape being a RectangleShape2D) it doesn't collide properly like it should. For example, if the player enter the Barrier shape in the right or the left or down side, the collision doesn't work. But, if the player enter by the top side of shape, so it collide with shape and the behavior is a collision. This kind of behavior of my Barrier with player it's like an One-way-platform, but I want that Barrier with full side collision.\r\n\r\nI've try load my Barrier.tscn in other new project test, and... it works! Only in my main project do not. \r\nFor this, I suspected be a bug.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nI don't know the exactly steps, but it occurs in my project only.\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example

It creates a fixed count of Threads, I feed it with tasks and it tries to keep the threads busy as much as possible until every task is done. But I've met negative improvement of the computation time of my tasks.\r\n\r\nI've then made an experiment:\r\nuse a simple function that takes lot of time, a for loop incrementing a variable.\r\n\r\nI run it once, it takes 200ms to execute.\r\nI run it in a thread, it takes 200ms.\r\nI run it 4 times, it takes 800ms to finish. Normal.\r\nI run it in 4 threads, it takes 550 ms. 0.66 times the previous result. Kinda disappointing.\r\n\r\nI check in the profiler:\r\nOn the average, the function needs 200ms when executed single threaded.\r\nOn the average, the function needs 400ms when executed in many separate threads. The more threads, the slower will be the function.\r\n\r\nI use a compiled version of godot that corresponds to the legacy branch of 19/01/2017, I also tried on the version 2.1.2 stable and the results were worse.\r\n\r\nI open this issue to ask if this behaviour seems normal. I've already messed with multithreading in C and Java on quad-cores and cutting 2/3 of the computation time is not an usual result for me.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n```gdscript\r\nfunc _ready():\r\n\tvar test_count = 4\r\n\tvar arg1 = 500000\r\n\tvar start\r\n\tvar stop\r\n\tvar test_time\r\n\tvar test_multi_time\r\n\r\n\tstart = OS.get_ticks_msec()\r\n\tfor i in range(test_count):\r\n\t\ttest(arg1)\r\n\tstop = OS.get_ticks_msec()\r\n\ttest_time = stop-start\r\n\t\r\n\tvar threads = []\r\n\tthreads.append( Thread.new() )\r\n\tthreads.append( Thread.new() )\r\n\tthreads.append( Thread.new() )\r\n\tthreads.append( Thread.new() )\r\n\tstart = OS.get_ticks_msec()\r\n\tfor i in range(test_count):\r\n\t\tthreads[i].start(self, \"test_multi\", arg1)\r\n\tthreads[0].wait_to_finish()\r\n\tthreads[1].wait_to_finish()\r\n\tthreads[2].wait_to_finish()\r\n\tthreads[3].wait_to_finish()\r\n\tstop = OS.get_ticks_msec()\r\n\ttest_multi_time = stop-start\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tprint(\"test : \", test_time)\r\n\tprint(\"test multi: \", test_multi_time)\r\n\tprint(\"ratio: \", float(test_multi_time)/test_time)\r\n\t\r\n\r\nfunc test(arg1):\r\n\tvar acc = 0\r\n\tfor i in range(arg1):\r\n\t\tacc +=1\r\n\treturn acc\r\n\r\nfunc test_multi(arg1):\r\n\tvar acc = 0\r\n\tfor i in range(arg1):\r\n\t\tacc +=1\r\n\treturn acc\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\n<!-- Optional but very welcome.

in _ready behavior from 2.1.1 to 2.1.2\r\n\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nStrange behavior when adding a node to a node that is not ready yet.\r\nAdding a child to a node, which is not yet ready, triggers the ready function of the child only after the  function, which is adding the child, is done.\r\nThe issue here would be an unexpected break in sequence, since normally the ready function is called right after the add_child( new_child_instance ) is done. \r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\n\r\nIn this small example it is shown that adding a child node to a not yet ready node gives a different sequence (add_child(), print(), child._ready() ) to when the same is done to a node which is ready (add_child(), child._ready(), print() ).\r\n\r\n[ready.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/783503/ready.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7827","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7827/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7827/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7827/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7827","id":208465246,"number":7827,"title":"Update

we have a shortcut to assign Nodes in the inspector instead of only relying on NodePath?\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\nI had to link individual nodes several times in my project, especially in tool scripts,\r\nbut I quickly found that I was repeating myself doing so.\r\n\r\nEverytime, my code looked like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```gdscript\r\nexport(NodePath) var node = null setget set_node_path\r\n\r\nvar _node = null\r\n\r\n\r\nfunc set_node_path(path):\r\n\tnode = path\r\n\tif is_inside_tree():\r\n\t\t_update_node_field()\r\n\r\n\r\nfunc _update_node_field():\r\n\tif node != null:\r\n\t\tvar n = get_node(node)\r\n\t\tif n extends Node2D:\r\n\t\t\t_node = n\r\n\t\telse:\r\n\t\t\tprint(\"Error: the node must be Node2D!\")\r\n\t\t\tnode = null\r\n\telse:\r\n\t\t_node = null\r\n\r\n\r\nfunc _ready():\r\n\t_update_node_field()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have to:\r\n- Use a backing field to store the actual node\r\n- test if we are in the tree to get it because otherwise access is denied.\r\n- update it in _ready() because deserialisation happens before it.\r\n- check for nulls because you can leave the path empty.\r\n- check the type because I usually need a specific one.\r\n- Eventually test if the path is valid before getting the node (not in the example)\r\n- Eventually do some more tests when setting the property (not in the example)\r\n\r\nThat's a lot of boilerplate, just for ONE property.\r\n\r\nIt would be really cool if we could instead have this:\r\n\r\n```gdscript\r\nexport(Node2D) node setget set_node\r\n\r\n# Property example, executed on ready\r\nfunc set_node(node):\r\n\t# Do custom logic\r\n\t# ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would still be saved as a NodePath, however at deserialization, if the exported type inherits Node, \r\nall of the previous boilerplate would be done to assign the field automatically.\r\nAs a bonus, because the node type is known, we can prevent designers from assigning wrong node types in the editor by greying them out in the selection window and cancelling drag and drop.\r\n\r\nIt won't break compatibility either because using NodePath would still work if needed.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7821/reactions","total_count":11,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7820","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7820/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7820/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7820/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/7820","id":207961823,"number":7820,"title":"Crash

The default Comperator now works correctly\r\nfor common types and floating point numbets.\r\n\r\n* Variant implements ::hash_compare() now. This function implements\r\nnan-safe comparison for all types with components that contain floating\r\npoint numbers.\r\n\r\n* Variant now has a VariantComparator which uses Variant::hash_compare()\r\nsafely compare floating point components of variant's types.\r\n\r\n* The hash functions for floating point numbers will now normalize NaN \r\nvalues so that all floating point numbers that are NaN hash to the same\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nC++ module writers that want to use HashMap internally in their modules\r\ncan now also safeguard against this crash by defining their on\r\nComperator class that safely compares their types.\r\n\r\nGDScript users, or writers of modules that don't use HashMap internally\r\nin their modules don't need to do anything.\r\n\r\nThis fixes
