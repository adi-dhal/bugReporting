this has been discussed before, but it was not clear in the docs, and it does annoy me a bit at times.\nBy topmost i mean the very first node/whatever-item you create, i called it root, but so many different things get named root in godot that i'm not sure it is the correct name for it.\n\nSo, after you create the very first item, nothing can be done to it, the only way to alter it is by deletion, which in practice means that i end up creating an empty node to start and then re-organize everything bellow it as i see fit.\n\nIf this is intended, and a design choice, it should be explicitly mentioned in the docs, preferably in the sceneTree docs, in the basics section.\n\nI'm guessing that it is because its a pretty considerable thing to be a bug, or a unintended side-effect of whatnot.\nEither way this issue is either a feature request, or a docs

This is in some cases preferable, but it should be fixed nevertheless.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3718","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3718/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3718/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3718/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/3718","id":133797243,"number":3718,"title":"Input actions mapped to joystick axes don't work with is_action_pressed","user":{"login":"Hinsbart","id":8281916,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/8281916?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart","html_url":"https://github.com/Hinsbart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-02-15T19:27:55Z","updated_at":"2016-04-19T18:31:09Z","closed_at":"2016-02-16T06:48:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"You can get those through InputEvents in the input callback, but `Input.is_action_pressed()` doesn't work with joystick axes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3717","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3717/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3717/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3717/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/3717","id":133781968,"number":3717,"title":"[Editor] File System ","user":{"login":"carlosmarti","id":5507549,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5507549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmarti","html_url":"https://github.com/carlosmarti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmarti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmarti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmarti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmarti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmarti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmarti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmarti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmarti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmarti/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-02-15T18:09:13Z","updated_at":"2016-02-15T19:05:52Z","closed_at":"2016-02-15T19:05:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It looks like when you create a new folder in godot it messes up the file system in the editor.

to the [tutorial on pausing](http://www.godotengine.org/projects/godot-engine/wiki/Pausing_The_Game), whenever the game is paused, `_process(delta)`, `_fixed_process(delta)`, `_input(event)`, and `_input_event(viewport, event, shape_idx)` will not be called.\n\nSupposedly, for any nodes who have `PAUSE_MODE_PROCESS` set, those functions will still be called. And indeed, `_process(delta)`, `_fixed_process(delta)`, and `_input(event)` all appear to be called for any nodes who have `PAUSE_MODE_PROCESS` set even while the game is paused. But such nodes will not call `_input_event(viewport, event, shape_idx)` while paused, regardless of what the pause mode is set to. Instead they will just queue up all the events, and report them simultaneously when the game is unpaused.\n\nAttached is an [Example](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/129364/Example.zip). It has two RigidBody2Ds which both inherit the same script. One is set to Pause Mode Stop, the other is set to Pause Mode Process.\n\nWhile the game is unpaused, both nodes report clicks in general and clicks on themselves specifically. When the game is paused, the one with Process Mode Process will still report on any general clicks, but it will not report that it has been clicked. This seems against the spirit of `PAUSE_MODE_PROCESS`, and makes it impossible to tell when a node was clicked on while the game was paused.\n\nWhen the game is unpaused, both nodes will report any clicks made on them as though they had just then happened, regardless of the pause setting.\n\nThis behavior occurs in both 1.1 Stable and 2.0 RC1 2016-02-09.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3703/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3702","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3702/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3702/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3702/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/3702","id":133463441,"number":3702,"title":"libudev packaging problems","user":{"login":"Hinsbart","id":8281916,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/8281916?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart","html_url":"https://github.com/Hinsbart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsbart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279098009,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:buildsystem","name":"topic:buildsystem","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-02-13T19:29:03Z","updated_at":"2016-02-14T17:18:51Z","closed_at":"2016-02-14T17:18:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"While reading through the irc backlogs I noticed this discussion (ping @punto- ):\n\n```\n<punto> can we statically link libudev.so? that one seems to not be as standard as the others\n<punto> (for example it's not on the steam runtime, at least not the version that we use to build on the build server)\n<Akien> punto: I have it in the steam runtime: /home/akien/.steam/steam/ubuntu12_32/steam-runtime/i386/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libudev.so.0\n<Akien> punto: Don't you mean libevdev?\n<Akien> punto: libevdev was dropped so shouldn't be an issue\n<punto> yeah but the build server links with libudev.so.1\n<punto> and package libudev0 doesn't exist anymore\n<punto> could we do the same with udev? replace it with normal code?\n<Akien> No idea\n```\n\nThe following options came into my mind:\n- Figure out a way to add statically linked libraries to the build system.
