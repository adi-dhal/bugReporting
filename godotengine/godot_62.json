It always happens when the following actions are performed:\r\n* Scene is loaded (in the editor or in the game)\r\n* Nodes are added or removed to any descendant of the VBoxContainer or itself\r\n\r\nAdditionally, sometimes (not reproducible in the attachment project), while resizing the VBoxContainer or its Panel child will suffer this issue after increasing the width to some specific amount. However this cannot have be reproduced in a minimal project yet, please take it in consideration.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this also applies to HBoxContainer with other parent nodes, but is been omitted for brevity.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n\r\n1. Open Godot 3.0 ALPHA1 editor on any desktop platform\r\n2. Create a new project\r\n3. Create a Control root node\r\n4. Create a TabContainer node under the root Control node\r\n5. Create a Tab node under the TabContainer node\r\n6. Create a ScrollContainer node under the Tab node\r\n7. Create a VBoxContainer node under the ScrollContainer node\r\n8. Create a Panel node under the VBoxContainer node\r\n9. Optionally add some nodes to the Panel node, like Label, LineEdit or Button for easier preview\r\n10. Set Panel min size as 0, 50\r\n11. Except Panel and it descendant, set anchor and margin as it follows (ordered as left, top, right, bottom):\r\n * Anchor: begin, begin, end, end\r\n * Margin: 0, 0, 0, 0\r\n12. Set Panel anchor and margin as it follows (ordered as left, top, right, bottom):\r\n * Anchor: begin, begin, end, begin\r\n * Margin: 0, 0, 0, 50\r\n13. Run the scene\r\n14.

All the old known ways used to handle the physics in the games remains untouched at all.\r\nI've made some videos where I compare the two physics engine and the only thing I did to swap the engines was select GodotDefault or Bullet in the settings.\r\n\r\nThere are two things to implement vehicle and kinematic character, I'll implement these if this PR will be accepted. The SCsub file must be improved to allow more customization of Bullet.\r\n\r\n## Presentation\r\nThanks to the good concept of Godot implementation I was able to implement Bullet in a natural way.\r\n\r\nIn this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYLQSaMXHmg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYLQSaMXHmg) I show the areas and the trimeshes that works perfectly, I want to point out that the areas can be used as trigger or space modificator, like is done by default Godot. In this video you can see all the balls that falls down under a limit enter inside a trigger area that destroy it.\r\nAnother thing is that as you can see Bullet manage better the trimesh collisions and the balls movement.\r\n\r\nIn this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X4GRbmfSnc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X4GRbmfSnc) I want to show you the improvements that Bullet port and for this reason I show three tests.\r\nThe first test show the joints implementation, So I've made a chain with dynamics number of elements. Using godot physics engine we are limited to 88 elements, but with Bullet we can go further to 300 with 30FPS.\r\nThe other test I test a slider, hinge, 6DOF + motor joints and with Godot physics it doesn't work at all.\r\nThe last test I made is usefull to demostrate that Bullet support perfectly the method of godot to create multi shaped bodies\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\nAs you can see by implementing Bullet physics engine we have the access to a very stable physics engine, that is a lot know and well documented, without losing any performance.\r\nWe also have the possibility to focus more on the implementation of new featurs like Cloth / soft bodies, or improve performance of trimesh by using [vertex reduction utility](http://www.bulletphysics.org/mediawiki-1.5.8/index.php/BtShapeHull_vertex_reduction_utility). And improve the vehicle stability.  I've also implemented the heightmap shape so when we'll implement the possibility to create the height field inside the engine the collision shape is ready to work.\r\n\r\nI think this is a good feature and improvement that speed up the implementation of the engine and port  even more interest about the third version of this engine, that with the new rendering engine and withy a stable physics engine make this game engine even more competitive.\r\nI don't want provide it as a GDNative because I want implement the things that I've pointed above (clothing) that are impossible to support using GDNative since I need to make some changes to engine code.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10013/reactions","total_count":54,"+1":28,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":12,"confused":0,"heart":14}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10012","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10012/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10012/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10012/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/10012","id":247079942,"number":10012,"title":"When removing a node with a skeleton, the console always writes an error (Godot 3.0 alpha 1)","user":{"login":"DimaKiva","id":11325733,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/11325733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaKiva","html_url":"https://github.com/DimaKiva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaKiva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaKiva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaKiva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaKiva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaKiva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaKiva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaKiva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaKiva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaKiva/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279128044,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/confirmed","name":"confirmed","color":"66dd66","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-08-01T14:02:57Z","updated_at":"2017-08-08T01:21:17Z","closed_at":"2017-08-08T01:21:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\r\nUbuntu 16.04, Godot 3.0 alpha 1\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nHey.

necessarily for Godot 3.0, but what do the core devs think about incorporating into Godot modules extremely generic renditions of Grid and HexGrid nodes for 2D/3D environments? I already know there are TileMap (2D) and GridMap (3D), but those are more for defining static environments and not for providing organization and auto-positioning for dynamic, multi-layered content. Like, for any given layer, defining a script base type that is allowed to exist on that layer and allowing the user to use the Grid node purely to facilitate movement, positioning, visibility, etc. of the objects they are putting into the game world. Something where my `get_cell` method returns an Object derived from the given script rather than just Int pointing to some texture/mesh in a static/baked file.\r\n\r\nClint Fleetwood already has a basic Hex module derived from incorporating stuff from RedBlobGames' documentation on hex math and the like: https://github.com/cefleet/HexModule\r\n\r\nIt would need a lot of work to refactor to meet the Godot coding conventions and generalize into a much more flexible object orientation. I was discussing it with him, and I just wanted to know whether something like this would ever even be considered for core engine integration as a module or if something like this would just be rejected / relegated to a plugin only.\r\n\r\nSeeing as how there are already TileMap, GridMap, and GridContainer built into the engine, it seems there is precedent for having organizational nodes built-in (without plugins), and there currently appears to be a  vacant slot for any nodes that help to organize non-environmental, non-UI objects within a 2D/3D space and according to some defined algorithm. That is likely the base type that would be planned, and then the Grid2D, Grid3D, HexGrid2D, and HexGrid3D node types would be derived from that type.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10005/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10004","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10004/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10004/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10004/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/10004","id":246761650,"number":10004,"title":"GDScript: Modulo operator does not function on floats","user":{"login":"nhydock","id":316728,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/316728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhydock","html_url":"https://github.com/nhydock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhydock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhydock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhydock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhydock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhydock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhydock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhydock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhydock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhydock/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false},{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097162,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/discussion","name":"discussion","color":"ee77ee","default":false},{"id":279098082,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:gdscript","name":"topic:gdscript","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":9,"created_at":"2017-07-31T13:48:40Z","updated_at":"2017-08-31T14:18:33Z","closed_at":"2017-08-31T14:16:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\r\nWindows 10\r\nGodot 3 alpha-1\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nUsing the modulo operator in GDScript only works for integers.
