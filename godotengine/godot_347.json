I tested in Ubuntu 14.10 with the\nUnity desktop, LXDE, and OpenBox and it worked as expected in all three.\n\nThis change includes the Xinerama extension and queries it when going\nfullscreen. Xinerama has information about the actual monitors\nconnected in a multi-monitor configuration. X normally treats both\nmonitors as a single large screen. Xinerama allows us to get the\nactual dimensions of attached screens. Nvidia TwinView and other\ndrivers use the Xinerama protocol so this should be compatible with\nmost multi-screen setups.\n\nThis forces fullscreen to always go to screen 0. This fixes #1408.\nThis also fixes the issue in some window managers (e.g. LXDE and\nOpenBox) where Godot would stretch across both monitors.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1447","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1447/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1447/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1447/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/1447","id":59125214,"number":1447,"title":"Dir object doesn't iterate on Android","user":{"login":"Spooner","id":159180,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/159180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spooner","html_url":"https://github.com/Spooner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spooner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spooner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spooner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spooner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spooner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spooner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spooner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spooner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spooner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-02-26T19:10:47Z","updated_at":"2015-04-28T12:39:09Z","closed_at":"2015-04-28T12:39:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This code, which works on Linux, gives no results on Android:\n\n``` GDScript\nfunc list_files_in_directory(path):\n    var files = []\n    var dir = Directory.new()\n    dir.open(path)\n    dir.list_dir_begin()\n\n    while true:\n        var file = dir.get_next()\n        if file == \"\":\n            break\n        elif not file.begins_with(\".\"):\n            files.append(file)\n\n    dir.list_dir_end()\n\n    return files\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4647","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"C0D5:2488B:30DBED1:3FE91BA:59D69FAD","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=348>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=346>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"7ad644dca7e65f2e9ff62cd35da76491\"","status":"200 OK"}}
