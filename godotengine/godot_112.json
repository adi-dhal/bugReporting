If you were to call this function using the using an integer of 2, you should expect m to return 0. However, when a variable is used to set the mask bit instead of entering a specific value. it actually changes the bit equal to twice the integer value. For example if layer = 2 then set_layer_mask_bit(layer, true) actually sets bit 4 of the mask to be true instead of bit 2, layer = 1 sets bit 2 and so on with the pattern being twice the passed value. I don't think this is intended to work this way as the documentation indicates that an integer is the expected type of the function set_layer_mask_bit and even if it is supposed to change twice the value for some internal reason, then passing a hard value like 2 should change the same bit as layer = 2.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8516","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8516/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8516/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8516/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8516","id":223884543,"number":8516,"title":"fixed a bug where saving a GDScript file crashed the editor","user":{"login":"karroffel","id":5209613,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5209613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karroffel","html_url":"https://github.com/karroffel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karroffel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karroffel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karroffel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karroffel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karroffel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karroffel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karroffel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karroffel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karroffel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279098082,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:gdscript","name":"topic:gdscript","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-04-24T16:53:20Z","updated_at":"2017-06-21T16:29:43Z","closed_at":"2017-04-24T20:36:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/8516","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8516","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8516.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8516.patch"},"body":"I changed the loop in #8502, turns out it fixed the error I was facing but introduced a new one.

Extensions\r\n\r\nAfter talking to @touilleMan and @reduz in Paris (it was awesome!!!) I'm writing down this proposal.\r\n\r\nGDNative is a nice way to use third party libraries in your game or just optimize performance critical code, but it *could* also be used to add \"extensions\" to Godot (for the lack of a better name, \"plugin\" and \"add-on\" are already taken 😛 )\r\n\r\n## Current situation\r\n\r\nA GDNativeScript represents *one class* in a GDNativeLibrary. To have any effect, this script must be attached to any object. This is cool to write game code or wrap third party code in a class.\r\n\r\nThe current way to \"extend\" Godot is via plugins (or more precisely, \"editor plugins\"). These plugins can do a lot of awesome things, but they all only run in the editor. GDNative scripts can be used to make plugins as well, but they can't do anything that will have an impact on the running game.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\n![extension](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5209613/25318699/7d9c0810-2894-11e7-865f-c4ceae5f6c84.png)\r\n\r\nHave a new project settings tab for \"extensions\". Extensions are GDNativeLibraries that don't need to expose any classes, they just get run and that's it.\r\n\r\nThese extensions get loaded at startup, in the editor as well as in a game.\r\n\r\n### Implementation of an extension\r\n\r\nA regular GDNativeLibrary, but it contains a special function `godot_native_extension_init` and `godot_native_extension_terminate` that get called at startup and shutdown of Godot.\r\n\r\nThe C API (modules/gdnative/godot.h and modules/gdnative/godot/*) will contain new functions, like `godot_extension_register_importer(godot_extension_importer *importer)`. The `godot_extension_importer` type would just be a struct with function pointers.\r\n\r\n### Loading and installing\r\n\r\nA new directory called \"extensions\" containing subfolders for the different extension. In those folders a file \"extension.cfg\" or something like that. This file specifies the GDNativeLibrary to use to load the extension.\r\n\r\n```\r\n- extensions\r\n    - fbx_loader\r\n        - extension.cfg\r\n        - fbx_library.tres\r\n    - python_language\r\n        - extension.cfg\r\n        - python_library.tres\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the editor or game starts the extensions get loaded.\r\n\r\nThe Asset Lib could feature a new type of asset: \"extension\" and install that in the right place.\r\nOnce installed then the extension would get initialized, editor restart should not be required.
