I am sure we dont want to disable it as it helps debug issues in the editor). it is just irritating to see a console in the background which i never need to look at.\n- ability to detach the output panel from the main editor (or direct output stream to a console)\n- allow context menu use/native os commands for resources/file system items (eg. i can right click a png file in the resources list and get the normal windows context menu. this allows me to quickly edit it in an image editor)\n- while editing values, the value should be preserved when the focus is removed from the field. currently the edited value is lost unless user presses enter.\n- allow selecting multiple nodes in the list for drag and drop and reassigning relations. currentl only ctrl + select is supported. shift + select should also be supported. mouse drag and select should also be supported. \n- option to hide \"Process being debugged exited\". this shouldnt be shown evertime i close the game view. else we can have this message shown in the output panel rather than in an alert.\n- ability to open the project manager from inside the editor\n- when trying to run a scene without having saved it, instead of the popup saying that the scene wasn't saved, just open the save scene dialog.\n-  Adding a scene (*.scn) directly as a tilemap without having to export it as a resource first.\n\nThere are a few more, but i'll add them later on.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1205/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1204","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1204/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1204/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1204/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/1204","id":54180933,"number":1204,"title":"new

Would be nice to let shader extend to its children. This way you can assign a shader to the parent, and export some properties. For example color. This way the shader can affect all children with the same shader and color for example.\n\nI think this can be solved in two ways. On the one hand let the parent say that it extends to the children. This checkbox can be directly under the shader for example. This way all information is gathered at one place.\nOn the other hand it is possible to give the children a checkbox which say that it uses the parent shader. This way you can specify directly which node uses the shader. But it is more tedious to set this for all nodes.

always snap to the top-left corner of their padded AABB.\nIf you draw a polygon so that all its vertices are snapped to the grid then move it it is impossible to place it so that the vertices are snapped to the grid, unless the snap size perfectly matches the padding size.\n\nSprites always snap to the top-left corner of their AABB.\nIf a sprite size isn't a multiple of the snap size it is impossible to place it neatly on the grid.\n\nI propose to snap the object origins rather than the AABB corner.\nThis way the snapping point of sprites may be adjusted by the offset.\nThis way polygons may be snapped and their snapped vertices remain on the grid.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1177/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4638","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"842E:572B:D0CFD4:1B96036:59D69FCE","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=357>;
