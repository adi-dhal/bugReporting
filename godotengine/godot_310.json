When I went to save the script I tried to save it as \"myScript.gd\", and got an alert from the editor that said \"File format requested unknown: gd\". Upon further inspection, my script is being saved to memory somewhere because when I quit and reopen the project it's still there, but its being named something like \"GDScript (11111)\" and not in my project folder anywhere. I can still open my other scripts (all with the \".gd\" extension) and edit/save them without any problems at all. I can also create a script by going to the script tab first and setting it's path there.
