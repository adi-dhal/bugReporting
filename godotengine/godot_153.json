It doesn't matter if it is the 32- or 64-bit version. I'm trying to run the exported game under Windows 10 (which runs in a VM), and it crashes. However, there is one difference: The 64 bit version crashes immediately, while the 32 bit version shows the title screen of the game and crashes when I press \"start\".\r\nThe game runs fine under Linux and in web. The cross compiled debug versions also work fine under Windows.\r\n\r\nThe fact that it does show the title screen when using the 32 bit version and doesn't when using the 64 bit version indicates that is has something to do with my game. But on the other hand, when it runs fine under linux and webgl (and the debug build), it should just work under Windows, shouldn't it?\r\n\r\nI found this issue relating to that problem: #2189 But this has been fixed, if I didn't misread.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nCompile godot under Linux.

Each class will always use the specified ip_type when resolving hostnames, setting sockets, sending data.\r\n- **[DESIGN]** IP_Address now handle IPv4 and IPv6 transparently:\r\n  - Converts to and from String transparently while handling IPv4 addresses as IPv6 mapped (::ffff:[IP]) internally.\r\n  - Setting/Getting of ip array is now only possible through dedicated functions (ie. set_ipv4, get_ipv4, set_ipv6, get_ipv6)\r\n  - Add function to know if the address is a valid IPv4 (for IP implementation and enet, will soon switch to dual stack for the latter).\r\n- **[REFACTOR]** `IP_Address::AddrType` enum moved `IP::Type` (GDScript `int.IP_TYPE_* -> IP.TYPE_*`)\r\n\r\nI know it's quite a patch, but it guarantees that we **handle IP addresses consistently** and each socket type will **use the appropriate format** for it when possible.\r\n**Hostname resolution** will also always be **correct for the given type** (assuming resolution for that type is possible at all).\r\n\r\nA test project for TCP/UDP is available here:\r\nhttps://github.com/Faless/gd-v6test\r\nI tested Linux, Android, OSX and Windows (native 7/10 and with Wine). UWP also seems to build fine.\r\nI can't test iOS but I see no reason why it should not work since it worked before (and also, it still works on Mac).\r\n\r\nWe still default to dual stack socket, which works out of the box on all officially supported platform for what I can tell.\r\nIf a specific socket type is required it's still possible to use it by calling `set_ip_type` on the UDP/TCP classes, and the HTTP (client/request) classes.\r\n\r\nI'd love a review from @punto- .\r\n@akien-mga please let me know if you prefer me to squash some commits.\r\nAny comment is welcome, because if there are some mistakes left I really can't see them after working on this and self-reviewing it so much :8ball:

system or device - Godot version:**\r\n2.1.1 stable (on Steam)\r\n\r\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\r\nWhen I hit play, the game freezes and will not start.\r\n I have no idea what causes this, but I suspect it has something with using **export (PackedScene),** and having the scenes reference each-other. What is supposed to happen, is that scene_1 is supposed to change to scene_2 when pressing space (ui_select) - and scene_2 to change back to 1 when pressing space again. I would understand why this would happen if they would automatically load eachother (thus causing a loop), but neither scene is instancing the other at startup, so it is odd.\r\n\r\n**_Edit 1:_** I can confirm that it still crashes, even if I do not run any code. It is definitely because of the e**xport (PackedScene)** that refer each-other.\r\n\r\n**_Edit 2:_** If you change the next_scene inside scene_2.tscn\r\n  `export (PackedScene) var next_scene`\r\ninto \r\n  `onready var next_scene = preload(\"res://scene_1/scene_1.tscn\")`\r\nIt works perfectly. It has something to do with export. \r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n1.
