events on `Control` nodes are properly consumed by default. This way if a button or other `Control` with `ignore_mouse` = **false** is clicked, the event is accepted and never sent through `_unhandled_input` functions. Currently this does not apply to touch events, so tapping a button on a mobile device will still send the event to `_input` as well as `_unhandled_input`, which causes conflicts between custom game inputs and tapping UI buttons. \r\n\r\nThis PR solves this issue by explicitly checking touch events separately from mouse events. It is designed to work with multitouch.\r\n\r\nA `stop_touch` flag has also been added, but to be honest I didn't notice any behavior difference with  `stop_mouse`. I only added it for good measure and the ability to handle touch events separately from mouse events in such a case.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nTested on OSX with `emulate_touchscreen`=**true**, Android, and

have a problem with shader. I am using [Godojo's water one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XcB46hN5Pg&t=4s), but once I put it into base scene, it only applies to scenes, which are not pre-made scenes instanced into the base one.\r\n\r\n![19](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20991844/30500587-46307824-9a5f-11e7-8a16-fdec60693b37.png)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the big plant and the elephant are not mirrored in water down below. I think, it is because the nodes, children ones of those, cannot be seen in base scene, therefore shader script is not using them and drawing them. Even the terrain made from polygon is actually visible in the mirrored image. Or maybe it is because they, the plant thing and the elephant nodes, are using Node2D as root.
