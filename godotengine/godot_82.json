It will render with less than 10 fps.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Things we know (would be good to know):\r\n - [x] This issue is not existing in the 2.1 version from the website\r\n - [x] Also present in release compile\r\n - [x] drawing texture style boxes needs less number calculations on the cpu when redrawn. (styleBoxFlat needs to calculate the size and position for multiple rectangles. This gets even more complex with the new style boxFlat (rounded borders)\r\n - [x] there is no noticeable difference in performance when I test it with the more complex calculations of the new style box. (taking all that into consideration, it does not seem like the lag has anything to do with the actual style box drawing)\r\n - [ ] the lag was introduced when switching to the new renderer in the viewport.\r\n - [x] the lag is much bigger when resizing the editor in a way that the main viewport gets resized.\r\n - [x] **probably has something to do with the input system**\r\nI marked things in the list which I know. the rest are more or the less questions which, when answered would help finding the issue for the low performance.\r\n\r\n@volzhs maybe you have already discovered additional

_believe_ this is a sampling issue in the texture shader used in the engine - you should sample from the center of the pixel, rather than the corner.

sampling (0,0,10,10) should become (0.5,0.5,9.5,9.5) and this should be

Thanks to @bojidar-bg for discussing this with me on IRC.\r\n\r\nI tested by creating a new project, and just add a lot of nodes to a scene.\r\nI found that the first 100 nodes inheriting from CanvasItem that i add to my scene drops my FPS by ~50% and on the other side if i add the first 100 spatial nodes (with camera so they render) my FPS drop by ~20%\r\n\r\nI am not sure the Node2D / Spatial comparison is that relevant, but it helped getting to the conclusion that it is CanvasItem.\r\n\r\nNext up i tried creating a TileMap and  filling 100 tiles from a TileSet and setting the Quadrant size to respectively 1 and 100, and sure enough when Quadrant size is set so it only draw and cull once i \"only\" drop about ~23%\r\n\r\nOf course it has a lower impact when only drawing/culling once, but my point is that a ~50% FPS drop on 100 empty Node2D's seems like a lot.\r\n\r\n\r\nI created a log of our conversation on IRC if interested (removed everything not related to this topic):\r\nhttps://pastebin.com/2BR1EKZX\r\n\r\n> bojidar_bg: I think you should open an issue about it, so that we might look at how culling can be improved (by using spatial hashing or quadtrees)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether this is a big performance issue or it is rather small i am not 100% sure about, but i think it would be interesting with some further look into this.\r\n\r\nI'll gladly elaborate on this if i haven't made it clear enough, and i am aware that more in-depth tests could be made, but hey, the prove a point
