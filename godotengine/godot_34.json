Remove any '*.import' files from the project's FileSystem to trigger a re-import of those files.\r\n\r\n**Results:** Assets get imported properly, but default setings do not get applied.\r\n**Expected Results:** Assets should be re-imported and if there are any default settings saved they should be applied.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10840/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4959","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"BD6F:572C:14FCC94:29ACF4F:59D69A23","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=35>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=33>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"b3b50b5a78c993f0d6254a63eabe37bb\"","status":"200 OK"}}
