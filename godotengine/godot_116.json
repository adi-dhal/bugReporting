12 || is_nan(10) == is_nan(12)\r\n\r\nThis will be true for all inputs, except for the NaN, not-NaN case. The macro\r\nhas been updated to now generate:\r\n\r\n(10 == 12) || (is_nan(10) && is_nan(10))\r\n\r\nso:\r\n\r\n(10 == 12)   || (is_nan(10)  && is_nan(12))  = false\r\n   False  or (False and False) is False\r\n(10 == 10)   || (is_nan(10)  && is_nan(10))  = true\r\n   True or (False and False) is True\r\n(Nan == 10)  || (is_nan(NaN) && is_nan(10))  = false\r\n   False or (True and False) is False\r\n(Nan == Nan) || (is_nan(NaN) && is_nan(NaN)) = true\r\n   False or (True and True) is True\r\n\r\nWhich is correct for all cases. \r\n\r\nThis bug was triggered because the hash function for floating point numbers\r\ncan very easily generate collisions for the tested Vector3(). I've also added\r\nan extra hashing step to the float hash function to make this less likely to\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nThis fixes #8081 and probably many more random weirdness.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8392","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8392/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8392/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8392/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/8392","id":221607083,"number":8392,"title":"Internal editor should not open when creating connections if external is enabled","user":{"login":"eon-s","id":10215987,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10215987?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eon-s","html_url":"https://github.com/eon-s","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eon-s/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eon-s/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eon-s/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eon-s/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eon-s/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eon-s/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eon-s/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eon-s/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eon-s/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279537176,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/hacktoberfest","name":"hacktoberfest","color":"00eeee","default":false},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":283518733,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"007700","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-04-13T15:58:33Z","updated_at":"2017-04-17T20:47:00Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"**Ubuntu 16.10 - Godot version: 2.1.2**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nSetting an external code editor and creating a signal connection with function using the Node panel, opens the internal code editor and adds the created function there, then appears the external editor, without function added (of course).\r\n\r\nI think that the connection creation should not open the internal editor if an external editor is active, even if than means no new function added.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n - Set up an external editor in editor settings.\r\n - Create a connection to a node with a script with \"make function\" enabled.\r\n - Both editors should open, the internal with the function, the external without it.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8391","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8391/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8391/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8391/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/8391","id":221595287,"number":8391,"title":"Game doesn't load on Android, it only keep blinking on splash screen.

They're super useful for UI drawing and save a lot of duplicate code. If not, can I implement them, and if yes, is there a favorized place for such?\r\n- Inflating / deflating `Rect2` structures. If you have a margin (4,4,4,4) and a rect (0,0,100,100), calling `inflate(4,4,4,4)` extends it to (-4,-4,104,104). You can also pass negative numbers to deflate. Idea stolen from .NET `System.Drawing.Rectangle`. Useful for expand margins etc.\r\n- Font drawing is given a `Point2`, but the origin of the resulting text always seems to be bottom-left. Add parameters to `font->draw` to accept center- or right-aligning, also vertically. Needed this quite some time when centering text in rectangles (text in `WindowDialog` titlebar or on tabs), especially since the font ascents and descents are annoying to work with. S. [here](https://github.com/Syroot/XRay/blob/master/src/Syroot.XRay/Video/Font.cs#L154) for some implementation idea in C# (which also fits text into a rectangle).\r\n- \"right\" and \"bottom\" properties on Rect2, which basically just return `pos.x + size.x ` or `pos.y + size.y`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8385/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8384","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8384/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8384/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8384/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/8384","id":221491775,"number":8384,"title":"has_virtual_keyboard()

Only one of them can be made current: clicking on both will disable the other one, and vice versa. Not sure how it affects the result, but it's a bit confusing in that situation.\r\n\r\nViewports also don't seem to bother about the project's stretch mode, because when I resize the window the field of view changes instead of stretching and staying centered on the player.\r\n\r\nThe minimap camera in fact does work, but due to the above, it also renders starting from its virtual top-left corner at 1:1 scale, clamping the rest. As a result, the tiny rectangle shows nothing, or a small part of the background.
