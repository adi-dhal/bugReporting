The capsule collider icon in the inspector shows an upright, vertical capsule so it's confusing.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5812","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5812/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5812/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5812/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5812","id":166486974,"number":5812,"title":"Linux: Automatically Make Binary Executable On Export","user":{"login":"toliaferrode","id":18036668,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/18036668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode","html_url":"https://github.com/toliaferrode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-07-20T03:29:52Z","updated_at":"2016-07-20T03:56:12Z","closed_at":"2016-07-20T03:56:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\nUbuntu MATE 15.10, Godot 2.0.4.1, Godot 2.1-beta\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nI like that the Godot executable ships executable by default now.

That way one can easily create a client & hook it up to an existing server effortlessly.\n\nI don't know if WebSockets are already supported in the current networking model, but so far I haven't seen mention of it anywhere & I wouldn't know how to implement it using the HTTP nodes.

I opened an [issue](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5762) that is similar to this, but I wanted to expand on it.\n\nI feel like there should be a Game button in the grid where 2D, 3D, Script, and now AssetLib are. I feel like this would be cleaner for the interface rather than opening the game in it's own window. With the game window open it's harder to get to the debugger, profiler, see your scripts, etc, unless you're running dual monitors. I think the way Unity does it is really great. Everything is totally accessible because of the game tab. Even Blender similarly does this with rendering by putting your render in interface when pressing F12.\n\nHow it would work is you can click on the game button to see it, or when you press play it automatically goes to the game mode.\n\nMaybe still including the option to open a window is good for people with more than one monitor.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5801","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5801/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5801/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5801/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5801","id":166242889,"number":5801,"title":"Crash while closing editor: Resources still in use at exit / ObjectDB instances still exist","user":{"login":"jahd2602","id":2841740,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2841740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahd2602","html_url":"https://github.com/jahd2602","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahd2602/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahd2602/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahd2602/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahd2602/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahd2602/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahd2602/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahd2602/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahd2602/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jahd2602/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-07-19T03:55:49Z","updated_at":"2016-07-19T05:17:43Z","closed_at":"2016-07-19T05:17:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\nWindows 8.1\nGodot 2.1\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nAfter closing the editor, windows reports a program crash, and the console shows various error messages.\n\n![breakout godot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2841740/16938091/55dad206-4d3a-11e6-82b3-399061e8623a.png)\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n1.

But this step has to be repeated each time the base scene is reimported.\n\nI use scn for base and tscn for inherited scene.\n\nedit:\nactually you don't have to start the game after creating collisionShape in base scene, just add it and delet it. With debug collision shapes enabled the shape in the inherited scene will be rendered, but the shape in use by physics is actually the one in base scene,which should be deleted.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5798/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5797","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5797/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5797/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5797/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5797","id":166229688,"number":5797,"title":"Zoom with mouse wheel in the new TextureRegion editor","user":{"login":"Zylann","id":1311555,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1311555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann","html_url":"https://github.com/Zylann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":283518733,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"007700","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/6","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/6/labels","id":1807486,"number":6,"title":"2.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":263,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-06-03T16:13:32Z","updated_at":"2017-09-18T11:53:44Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2017-09-18T11:53:44Z"},"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-07-19T01:35:58Z","updated_at":"2016-09-22T13:28:42Z","closed_at":"2016-09-22T13:28:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Not much of an issue, but the old TextureRegion editor allowed to use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
