system or device - Godot version:**\r\nWindows 10\r\nGodot 2.1.2\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nReopening #4008 for a continued request of the feature.\r\nThe game I am working on is designed using 2.5d graphics with multiple layers for bridges, cliffs etcetera. In order to make the Y ordering to work all objects need to be placed under the same YSort node or the player needs to be moved between different 'Rooms' YSort nodes. I chose to move the player between rooms as due to other game needs/requirements. However when I tried using the solution offered in #4008 there is a noticeable flickering during room transitions where the player is first drawn with regard to a local position after reparenting and then corrected to a global positioning. If there is a solution to the flickering I am more then willing to accept that the feature request priority is minimal compared to other requests but I was unable to find a solution (browsing issue trackers, google, etc.) or the solution provided did not solve the flickering issue.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nCreate two 'Room' Nodes with a Area2d Child Node for body detection. Make sure the rooms are larger than the view port for easy notice of the issue. Populate the rooms with some sprites to help with identify the problem. Attach the following script:\r\n```gdscript\r\nfunc _fixed_process(delta):\r\n\tvar bodies  = get_overlapping_bodies()\r\n\tif( bodies.size() > 0):\r\n\t\tfor b in bodies:\r\n\t\t\tif( b.has_method(\"set_room\")):\r\n\t\t\t\tvar parent = b.get_owner()\r\n\t\t\t\tif( parent != self):\r\n\t\t\t\t\tb.set_room(self)\r\n```\r\nCreate a 'Player' Node with a KinematicBody2d and a child CollisionShape2d. Write some basic movement code with the following method:\r\n```gdscript\r\nfunc set_room( node):\r\n\tvar parent = self.get_parent()\r\n\tvar transformation = get_global_transform()\r\n\tparent.remove_child(self)\r\n\tnode.add_child(self)\r\n\tself.set_owner(node)\r\n\tset_global_transform(transformation)\r\n```\r\nMove the player from one room to another, on transition there is a flicker where the player is first drawn with the position relative to local and then corrected to global.\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\n**READ BEFORE DOWNLOADING**\r\nSome of the images/sprites used in this project are licensed by me from their respective copyright holders. I am able to distribute them with my project as part of my project but their use beyond that is prohibited.

This allows users to use scripting to vary game behavior depending on whether the car is on ground or in air (e.g. don't handle input at all if we're in air or apply smaller force or smaller steering or whatever)\r\n\r\n2) You can now set the roll_influence variable in editor. The smaller the value, the smaller the roll the car body experiences in turns. 0.1 is still the default value, but you can now set a larger value (for even greater roll) or smaller (for roll that is only cosmetic and doesn't threaten rollover).\r\nThis is especially important if someone wants different kinds of cars that behave differently wrt roll (e.g. a pickup truck vs a minicar vs a sports car)\r\n\r\nEDIT: Made for 2.1. but easily pickable into master (by someone who actually can cherry pick as opposed to me)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8787/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8786","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8786/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8786/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8786/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8786","id":229004228,"number":8786,"title":"Fix
