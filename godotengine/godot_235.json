This leads to the fact that the objects with the body of type RigidBody falls through other objects.\n\nI tried to upload a collision mesh from Blender (-colonly) and created it in the Godot [link](http://www.godotengine.org/qa/4076/why-is-the-object-barrel-rigidbody-doesnt-stay-on-terraina) Unloaded from the Blender collision meshes don't work at all, collision meshes created in Godot are working with an error.\n\nMaybe I did something wrong. So I asked council: [link](http://www.godotengine.org/qa/4186/problems-with-physics-and-rigidbody)\nApparently nobody knows how to fix this error.\n\nI experimented and found a compromise solution. I have not uploaded a collision mesh from Blender and created in Godot: \"BoxShape\", \"CapsuleShape\", etc. It reduces the symptoms error of physics.\nIt is obvious that it is often not acceptable. This approach does not allow to fully develop a game with modern graphics.\n\nAdditionally I have studied third-party example [link](https://github.com/gokudomatic/godot_fps_crawler). And it turned out that there is also a problem with physics. Possible using a weapon to throw the enemy outside the game cards (for this purpose it is necessary to pinch in the corner and intensively to attack). Also using mines and being against the wall you can throw the player outside the playing card (game character).\n\nSumming up, I think it's a problem in the physics engine. I think this is a very serious problem when creating a 3D game with interactive space.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4830","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4830/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4830/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4830/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4830","id":157066743,"number":4830,"title":"[WIP/RFC] Fix calling XMapWindow before XSetClassHint","user":{"login":"noh4ck","id":3076780,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3076780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/noh4ck","html_url":"https://github.com/noh4ck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noh4ck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noh4ck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noh4ck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noh4ck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noh4ck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noh4ck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noh4ck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noh4ck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noh4ck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false},{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097162,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/discussion","name":"discussion","color":"ee77ee","default":false},{"id":410064485,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/needs%20testing","name":"needs testing","color":"ff9900","default":false},{"id":279097326,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:linux","name":"platform:linux","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279098255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:porting","name":"topic:porting","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-05-26T20:02:54Z","updated_at":"2017-06-27T09:14:46Z","closed_at":"2017-06-27T09:14:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/4830","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4830","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4830.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4830.patch"},"body":"Add new context CONTEXT_PLAYER, move the XMapWindow call to the\nset_context function in os_x11.cpp. Add another set_context call for\nwhen you hit the play button.\n\nResolves #4827 \n\n**NOTE:** This pull request really needs to be reviewed/tested as it might lead to other bugs.
