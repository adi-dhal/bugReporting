system or device - Godot version:**\nWindows 10 Pro. Latest from GitHub repo.\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nWhen scripting, if I search help or open a class reference page, I can read about that class. Right after I saved the project and restarted Godot, then opened that same project again, that class reference page is opened but it displays nothing. I have to close it and then look it up again for it to show the text again.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n1. Create a new project, make a scene, put a script on a node, edit the script.\n2. Click \"Search Help\" in the script editor, open a page. Or click on \"Classes\" and open a page.\n3. Now, don't close the opened help page. Save the project and exit Godot.\n4. Open Godot again and open back the same project just now. You'll notice that help or class reference page is still opened, as it shows up in the list, but it is empty on the right side.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5716/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5715","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5715/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5715/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5715/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5715","id":165714385,"number":5715,"title":"Perform

does not seem to work with windows' 'start' command - used to open a file with the default application assigned to its file type.\nIt works in CMD terminal - but not when i try to do it through godot.\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/blurymind/02325f99edd446009834cbddecf02212\n\nOther commands that have been identified to not work with OS.execute are \ndir  echo  cat   and some other system commands.\n\nA possible connection to this:\nhttp://www.frankworsley.com/blog/2007/9/24/open-a-file-in-the-default-application-using-the-windows-command-line-without-jdic\n\nFortunately there is a workaround for this. Using OS.shell_open ('path-to-target') instead would open a CMD terminal and run the command.\n\nI reported this on FB - but was adviced to also file it here.
