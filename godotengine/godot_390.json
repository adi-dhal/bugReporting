You take an Area2D Node and when a body enters it (using the on_body_enter() signal) you set a variable to true and when it exits you set it to false. When the player attacks, you check if the variable is true and then apply the attack. Couldn't the Area2D node just have is_colliding() functionality attached to it? I know kinematic bodies do, but they also can't be passive, they push whatever is in front of them, unless I'm mistaken somehow.

I scale a RigidBody2D node that has a child Sprite node, the Sprite looks like it is scaled appropriately in the Godot editor. However, when I run the scene, the RigidBody2D does not appear to be scaled at all. An example of this can be seen if you scale one of the balls in the rubegoldberg demo.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/178","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/178/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/178/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/178/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/178","id":29008202,"number":178,"title":"rename node -> change in scripts?","user":{"login":"adolson","id":6351421,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6351421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson","html_url":"https://github.com/adolson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2014-03-07T23:49:51Z","updated_at":"2014-12-09T04:31:06Z","closed_at":"2014-12-09T04:31:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If I add a button and call it \"Button\" and write some GDScript that references it such as get_node(\"Button\").connect, if I later on rename the button to \"btnOptions\", I also have to go into the code and change any references, to get_node(\"btnOptions\").connect, for example.\n\nIs there any plugin or option that automates this?
