unsure if this has been discussed and dismissed, but I think this engine would benefit from allowing objects to run multiple scripts. As far as I am aware there is no feature for this but correct me if I am wrong.\n\nI feel like this would be a very good way to separate functionality and keep devs from having to create scripts that might combine behaviour they have already written. Like for example, if you want an enemy that has the same AI as the basic enemy but needs some special functionality like enhanced AI for given scenarios, it might help to just add a smaller script containing the extended AI features rather than a longer script containing the basic AI mixed with the enhanced AI. This is not currently my issue and I do realize this problem can be solved by using Godot's current scripting solution, however I feel like this feature would help modulate scripts for better project management.\n\nLet me know what you think,\nthanks for

Should this be renamed to a general config file thing?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3197/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3196","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3196/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3196/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3196/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/3196","id":124578581,"number":3196,"title":"Mouse grab error when modifying a slider/spinbox min/max values by dragging","user":{"login":"hetdegon","id":323651,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/323651?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetdegon","html_url":"https://github.com/hetdegon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetdegon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetdegon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetdegon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetdegon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetdegon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetdegon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetdegon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetdegon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetdegon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279128044,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/confirmed","name":"confirmed","color":"66dd66","default":false},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/1/labels","id":1381437,"number":1,"title":"2.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":444,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-10-28T13:37:45Z","updated_at":"2017-07-28T10:44:22Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2017-07-28T10:44:22Z"},"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-01-02T06:59:37Z","updated_at":"2016-01-11T10:50:50Z","closed_at":"2016-01-11T10:50:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Since a few commits ago, and still existing in be1f2a0, trying to modify the value of certain editor spinboxes in the inspector by click-dragging mouse over the value, will do something weird with the mouse. Instead of modifying the value and releasing the mouse when the mouse button is released, it'll prematurely stop modifying the spinbox and the mouse will be released, but the cursor will remain hidden, and it will return to the position of the edited spinbox in regular intervals.\n\nThe only way to restore the mouse cursor in the editor is to close everything and reopen. This can be detrimental as undo buffers can be lost. Fortunately, the scene can still be saved and exited with the keyboard. Alt+tabbing out of the editor shows the mouse cursor again, but returning to the editor will hide it immediately.\n\nI am not entirely sure, but seems it's more likely to happen when the spinbox has decimal values, with integer ones, at least the ones I use frequently, can be modified in this fashion with no issues.\n\nSystem is Ubuntu 15.10 64b, KDE desktop (kwin 5). I haven't tried to reproduce in other OSs or windowing systems at the time, but if no one else can reproduce the issue it could be something to check.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3195","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3195/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3195/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3195/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/3195","id":124578297,"number":3195,"title":"TSCN format not keeping signal binds.","user":{"login":"hetdegon","id":323651,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/323651?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetdegon","html_url":"https://github.com/hetdegon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetdegon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetdegon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetdegon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetdegon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetdegon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetdegon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetdegon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetdegon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetdegon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/1/labels","id":1381437,"number":1,"title":"2.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":444,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-10-28T13:37:45Z","updated_at":"2017-07-28T10:44:22Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2017-07-28T10:44:22Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-01-02T06:45:29Z","updated_at":"2016-01-06T12:01:59Z","closed_at":"2016-01-06T12:01:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Binds assigned to signals (rightmost panel, when connecting a new signal to a node) aren't preserved in the TSCN format by commit  be1f2a0\n\nWhen creating one and saving the file (in TSCN) it will show as\n\n```\n[connection signal=\"pressed\" from=\"SkillEdit/SkillLV1\" to=\".\" method=\"_on_SkillLV_pressed\"binds= [ 0 ]]\n```\n\nNote there's no space in between the double quote and binds.

issue is related to the topic discussed in #2861 about the PopupMenu API and the index/ID behaviour.\n\nIf there is going to be improvements related to this, it would probably be done for **3.0** as reduz and Akien mentioned (_\"as it would likely break the API\"_ compatibility).\n\nI quote here what I think are the key parts of that discussion:\n\n> ...\n> \n> I still find a problem here though. Here is another example code:\n> \n> ```\n> menu.add_item(\"First\", 0) # id 0\n> menu.add_item(\"Second\", 1) # id 1\n> menu.add_item(\"Third\") # id 0\n> ```\n> \n> Is it fine to have repeated IDs? With this code, if I press the element _**Third**_ in the menu, the following will happen:\n> \n> ```\n> func _menu_item_pressed(id):\n>     var index = menu.get_item_index(id)\n>     prints(index) # Prints 0\n>     prints(menu.get_item_text(index)) # Prints First\n> ```\n> \n> -**neikeq**\n# \n\n> ...\n> \n> On the other hand that would be problematic:\n> \n> ```\n> menu.add_item(\"First\", 2) # id 2\n> menu.add_item(\"Second\", 1) # id 1\n> menu.add_item(\"Third\") # id 2\n> ```\n> \n> I'm actually starting to wonder what this whole ID stuff is about. Why not use only indexes? If IDs are necessary, the code needs to be improved to prevent adding IDs that already exist...\n> -**Akien**\n# \n\n> ...\n> \n> The reason we have custom ID is that itś because it's pretty handy to add an enumerator constant as ID and then check it in a switch.\n> -**reduz**\n# \n\n> Hm... I find the behaviour as described in the documentation super confusing personally :)\n> Even after @neikeq's fix, I guess it would still be possible to do:\n> \n> ```\n> menu.add_item(\"First\") # index 0 and id 0\n> menu.add_item(\"Second\") # index 1 and id 1\n> menu.add_item(\"Third\", 0) # index 2 and id 0 !!\n> ```\n> \n> Maybe we could think of a better way to allow using enum constants as IDs without having this duality of the \"id\" argument?\n> \n> ...\n> -**Akien**\n# \n\n> I think it might make more sense to use the `index` by default instead of `id`, i.e. `_menu_item_pressed(index):`, and provide a `get_item_id(index)` function.\n> \n> `index` would therefore be guaranteed without duplicates, and it would still be possible to check an enum constant in a switch by using `get_item_id(index)`. Items without user-defined ID would get assigned -1 as ID.\n> \n> WDYT?\n> -**Akien**\n# \n\n> Adding some more input from a discussion on IRC:\n> \n> ```\n> <reduz> Akien, neikeq: I think the righ behaviour should be to use ID if exists and otherwise emit with index\n> <TheHX> but the fill mode of RichTextLabel don't seems to be working correctly\n> <reduz> Akien, by default if you don't want ID, you can simply no use it\n> <reduz> Akien, but yeah i just checked the code and it wasn't right, I changed it to actually emit index\n> <Akien> reduz: The problem is that you might have IDs which are the same as indexes of elements without ID.\n> <reduz> Akien, that is intended, IDs are more of a very handy feature when you work with enums so it's up to you to use them or not\n> <Akien> reduz: The index is the only one that you can guarantee as unique IMO, so it's better to use it by default and make the ID accessible via another method\n> <reduz> you can not use them and use metadata instead for referencing something\n> <reduz> Akien, yes if you want to do it that way, then simply don't use IDs and use metadata to store an ID\n> <Akien> reduz: No I mean use get_item_id instead of get_item_index as I proposed\n> <Akien> It won't make ID less useful, you just need to use the function to get it instead of getting an \"id\" parameter that could be an id or an index, and you don't know which\n> <reduz> Akien, i prefer not, as in most cases some people prefers to use enums and might forget to go the extra step to convert\n> <Akien> Yeah but the current behaviour (at least the intended behaviour as described in the doc) is very confusing. You need to *know* how you defined your items to be able to parse them properly\n> <Akien> But it's true that nobody complained so far ;)\n> <reduz> Akien, maybe we acould be done is change the callbacks\n> <reduz> Akien, have item_pressed and item_pressed_by_id\n> <reduz> still though, can't do any compat breaking change until 3.0\n> <reduz> if we change this, it will be in 3.0\n> <Akien> reduz: Well 2.0 is not released yet, you can still break compat\n> <Akien> People who use the alpha right now are aware that it's an alpha and can change\n> <reduz> Akien, i prefer to wait, i have a long list of things to change that break compatibility that I prefer goes all at once\n> <Akien> Alright :)\n> <Akien> neikeq: WDYT?\n> <reduz> it makes sense that you get index though, I would simply just do two signals: \"item_pressed\" and \"id_pressed\"\n> <neikeq> well I agree with Akien. index makes more sense. currently you don't really know if you are receiving an id or an index\n> <Akien> reduz, neikeq: Or just do as neikeq propose: pass two arguments. \"item_pressed(index, custom_id)\"\n> <Akien> With custom_id being -1 for items without ID\n> <Akien> This way people can use directly custom_id if they know that's what they want (they use enums), or index if they don't use enums, or both if they know they use both\n> <Akien> (typically parse custom_id first, and in case it's -1, use index)\n> <reduz> ok, makes sense, though i guess until 3.0 i prefer to not touch it\n> ```\n> \n>
