on Godot 2.1 beta and 2.1 stable, Windows 10 64 bits\n\nWhen generating a surface with `SurfaceTool` and the `add_smooth_group(true)` method, it's impossible to get smooth normals if UVs are added to vertices.\nI found that it specifically happens when UVs are not increasing from one vertice to another. So if every quad of a surface has UVs going from 0 to 1, the quad will be rendered with hard face normals.\nBecause of this I am forced to generate normals myself.\n\nNot sure if it's a bug because I believe it was implemented so it does that.
