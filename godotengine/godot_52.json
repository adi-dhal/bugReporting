system or device - Godot version:** \r\nLinux x64, happens on 2.1.3 **and** latest 3.0.\r\n\r\n@godotengine/pr-mergers please cherry picked to 2.1 in case of a PR \r\n\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\n<!-- What happened, and what was expected. -->\r\nWhen using `Navigation2D.get_simple_path()` (with the `optimized` argument set to false) the points returned sometimes contains *two* identical points, requiring a workaround to make simple path follow scripts work.\r\n\r\nThe first position returned is *always* the starting position, but sometimes when the starting position is the same a *previously returned position*, this position will be in the returned point-list **twice**.\r\n\r\nA theoretical 1-dimensional example:\r\nYou want to go from 0 to 3, the returned points are `[0, 1, 2, 3]`.\r\nThen if you are at **exactly 1** the returned points sometimes are `[1, 1, 2, 3]`.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nI included an example project down below with many comments.\r\nThe example project is using **3.0**, but I know that this problem exists in 2.1.3 too.\r\n\r\nThe example projects lets the sprite find the mouse position. <kbd>enter</kbd> toggles the following of the path.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce without the example project:\r\n - set up a Navigation2D with NavigationPolygonInstance\r\n - use `get_simple_path()` on every frame (in practice needed for moving enemies, for example)\r\n - move along the returned path, only moving towards the next position returned earlier.\r\n - observe that some points occur multiple times\r\n\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\n<!-- Optional but very welcome.

However, it leads to code duplication and clutter and so having a single data structure that allows insertion-based iteration is beneficial.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements OrderedHashMap that internally stores HashMap and a List for ordering. It'll be used for implementing [ordering of NativeScript properties](https://github.com/endragor/godot/commit/2d7c2aeb2f8d04a783148df432477687f449866a) and can be utilized wherever a data structure with these properties is necessary.\r\n\r\nI renamed HashMap's Entry to Element for consistency with other collections APIs.

system or device - Godot version:**\r\nUbuntu 17.04\r\nGodot 2.1.3 & Godot 3 (commit a75623f436c215e107ede321afa08a1897552deb)\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nWhen I try to read a large file using the File class in GDScript the execution seems to work fine. However, if I set a breakpoint after the line `file.get_as_text()` the debugger gets closed and the next message is shown in the console:\r\n\r\n`ERROR: put_packet: Condition ' p_buffer_size + 4 > temp_buffer.size() ' is true. returned: ERR_INVALID_PARAMETER\r\n   At: core/io/packet_peer.cpp:220.\r\nERROR: _notification: Condition ' cmd.get_type() != Variant::STRING ' is true.\r\n   At: editor/script_editor_debugger.cpp:970.`\r\n\r\nNote: this output is from Godot 2.1.3. In Godot 3 the output is the same but the highlighted line in `script_editor_debugger.cpp` is 991 rather than 970.\r\n\r\nI noticed this when trying to read a large JSON file (see the attached project `test.zip`). I also tried to remove keys from the JSON file (`tile_info.json` in the project) to check if at some point the debugger stops getting broken. And it does. So I assumed the size of the file has something to do with this issue.\r\n\r\nI also tried to avoid the conversion from JSON to Dictionary (this isn't the cause of the issue, but I needed a temporal solution to keep working) by creating a Dictionary object straight away in a GDScript file and pasting the content of the JSON there. The behavior is exactly the same: the debugger keeps getting broken. This is not included in the minimal example project and I have tested it only in Godot 2.1.3.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n1. Open the attached project (`test.zip`) with Godot 3.\r\n2. Run the project to check that `tile_info.json` content is printed out correctly.\r\n3. Comment out the line `# breakpoint` and run the project again\r\n4. The debugger doesn't work anymore and the buttons stop responding.\r\n\r\nNote: if you remove lines from `tile_info.json` until you've got around 4000 lines everything starts to work fine.\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\n[test.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/1219975/test.zip)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10308/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10307","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10307/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10307/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10307/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10307","id":249824560,"number":10307,"title":"Updated
