However that is as far as one can get since the rest of the necessary functionality is missing.  There is no method to:\n1. indicate the editor's main screen has been selected visible (unhide your controls),\n2. indicate the editor's main screen is about to switch (hide your controls), nor\n3. method to call to get the client area for the main screen so the scene of controls may be placed appropriately (and subsequently removed on deactivation) into the scene tree.\n\nJust so we're clear I've attached an image.  The \"main screen\" as understood by both the API and the current help documentation refer to the area outlined by the green box as the \"main screen\".  It does not refer to the entire editor window.  There has been confusion when I brought this up on FB and some folks figured I wanted the entire editor window which is not the case (which has its own issues anyways such as appearing over top menus and stuff making it only suitable for popups and dialogs, not a long-lived editor control with large real estate footprint making it unsuitable for the sidebars).\n\n![plugin-screenie](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1862162/16927675/64c83b34-4ce3-11e6-8f74-8a70983ca4b2.png)\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n\nmyplugin.tscn:\n\n```\n//bunch of

the first of what I hope to be a series of optimizations and improvements to the otherwise fairly limiteded pre-existing mesh morph system, this changes the technique for reading and modifying morph values from string comparsion to a more conventional ID-based system similar to bones in a Skeleton. The AnimationPlayer is made aware of this change and handles it at the caching stage, caching the IDs in the same way as bones are cached.\n\nThis should make it a future-proofed technique for animations making frequent changes to the morph tracks (facial animation, ect.). A new signal has been added to the MeshInstance which is emitted whenever the mesh is reassigned, which is needed to signal to the AnimationPlayer that the cache needs to be rebuilt. Some new methods have also been added for handling morph track IDs. Morph tracks can still be handled through the set and get methods (which is needed to retaining access to the them through the property window), so all pre-existing functionality concerning morph tracks should be unaffected, but using the newly added methods is the preferred way of dealing with morph tracks through code.\n\nIt's a small internal change, but I think it's a key part of bringing signficant improvements to morph system, and one which I feel I can put forward with confidence right away.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5769/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5768","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5768/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5768/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5768/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5768","id":166014667,"number":5768,"title":"Select Physics Body Node Instead of Mesh Node","user":{"login":"toliaferrode","id":18036668,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/18036668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode","html_url":"https://github.com/toliaferrode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":283518733,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"007700","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-07-18T03:46:29Z","updated_at":"2016-07-19T03:10:02Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\nAny OS, any Godot version\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nWhen selecting objects in the editor window to reposition, it selects the mesh node instead of the physics body it's attached to.
