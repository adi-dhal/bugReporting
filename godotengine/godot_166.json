I was browsing Reddit, I came across a post describing a \"fake 3D\" method in the game NIUM (thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/57x7n3/really_cool_fake_3d_in_gamemaker_by_the_creator/)).\n\nThis seems like a really cool effect, and I was excited to experiment with it, but as I went into the Godot documentation I realized that there's absolutely no way to draw a sprite on the screen with a given rotation, barring manually manipulating the pixels yourself. While technically, you could achieve the same effect by stacking `Sprite` nodes as a child to the root node (which some people have suggested), this seems like it should be a remarkably inefficient process, as each node is receiving its own callbacks from the engine.\n\nI'd like to request a simple, additional, optional parameter to the [`draw_texture` function family](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/class_canvasitem.html#class-canvasitem-draw-texture) which specifies an angle to rotate the sprite by when drawing it, much like Game Maker has in its `draw_sprite_ext` function.\n\nFor the record, when I was looking for a solution to this, I checked for, in order:\n- A way to rotate the sprite when drawing it\n- A way to make translations independent of rotation when drawing\n- A way to rotate the ImageTexture/Texture before drawing it\n\nNone of these came out fruitfully, unless I completely missed something.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6903/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6902","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6902/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6902/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6902/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6902","id":184660677,"number":6902,"title":"Feature Request: TileMap improvements","user":{"login":"UnwarySage","id":9922379,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/9922379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/UnwarySage","html_url":"https://github.com/UnwarySage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UnwarySage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UnwarySage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UnwarySage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UnwarySage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UnwarySage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UnwarySage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UnwarySage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UnwarySage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UnwarySage/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279097162,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/discussion","name":"discussion","color":"ee77ee","default":false},{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-10-22T23:19:32Z","updated_at":"2016-10-27T07:10:29Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I would like to request a few simple-ish functions for the tilemap class, based on my dabbling with procedural levels.\n\nget_extents():\nReturns a rect2 or similar structure that contains the space occupied by non-empty cells.

Instant crash.\nI was told by Henkz on IRC that he couldn't reproduce, so this might be related to something in the Ubuntu 16.10 build environment compared to 16.04? If any digging is required, let me know.\nAlternatively, creating a new scene, adding a ParallaxBackground, then a ParallaxLayer and changing the scale seems to reliably crash here.\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\nPlatformer 2D demo can trigger this crash.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6890","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6890/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6890/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6890/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/6890","id":184584331,"number":6890,"title":"Fix
