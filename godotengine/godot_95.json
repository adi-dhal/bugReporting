It comes from the good 'ol '80; if you still don't know what I am talking about, take a [look at this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_PC_booter_games)\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, maybe \"OSless\" is not the correct definition for it; since there should be always a pack of software for kernel, services and drivers to run any game; but it gives pretty much the core idea of what's all about.\r\n\r\nObviously we talk about something that's already here: Linux's binaries of Godot... and the very bare needs Godot Engine needs to run. I am talking about the Kernel, X11, OpenGL, networking (for updates and stuff) and the input service (for keyboard, mouse, joypad etc)... everything else scraped away in order to have achieve the fastest \"reboot PC directly in game\"\r\nno CUPS and its drivers, no server/services (that are not strictly related to the game engine/network)  like webcam support, dvb-t etc... hell, it doesn't even need to support other filesytems other than EXT4 and other /dev/sd* partitions and devices (also this is supposed to increase safety by sandboxing as much as possible).\r\n\r\n**But on which media? 3.5 floppies?**\r\nFirst, let me tell you something: inside my PC desktop there's NO internal Hard Disk. Everything I do on my Lubuntu runs from a USB3 pendrive (64GB)... and from there I can do everything... also I am able to pick up my usb drive and bring with me my \"desktop experience\" on virtually any other 64bit PC. From said pendrive I can run any virtualised Windows machine from 3.1 all the way up to 8 (10 untested due to personal disinterest).\r\nWith the world completely gone \"mobile\" internal disks are a structural obsolescence kept up by convenience: the only way Microsoft can claim \"ownership\" on your pc.\r\n\r\nYou can make your own Desktop Linux persistent USB3 pendrive... and boot the same experience on virtually any PC: bring on your old PC with integrated Intel HD and play at lower setting at  720p, or give it a try on your shiny new battlestation with a powerful R9 390X @4k at Ultra settings. Fully re-distributable open source drivers from AMD and Intel.\r\nNo need to reinstall, no need cloud storage to bring your save games\r\nOne simple usb key to boot your machine and seamlessly continue play anywhere lays a pc around.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What's good for?**\r\n...for developer: it's an easy and convenient way to quickly test your game on the bare hardware of random PC around the world. Deploy your game on a 2inch 32GB pen drive... and go around (with given permission) and try to boot your game anywhere. A friend of yours just bought a Nvidia GTX 2048Ti? Go there and boot your game; you can even go in a repair shop and (after asking kindly) test your game. If you're competent enough, you can even integrate your own hardware DRM ([with Namco style encryption](https://medium.com/@dropkickshell/system-n2-exposed-5395436c824d) ) and sell your game as physical usb keys.\r\n...for gamers: plug key, play the game. Finish playing? Put the key in your pocket: the saved games  and the *whole thing* is physically there. No one can peek in the stuff you play/do any more. Lan party? You need to bring your rig only if **there are not** PC already there. If your Lan party already got PCs... you just need the key with (all) your Godot game(s).\r\n\r\n**The OS \"less\" part:**\r\nWell... obviously there's still a kernel and a collection of packages: technically still an OS, but keeping in mind there's almost \"no operating\" since it will be cut out all the features not related to the game runtime and safety. Good quality usb3 flash disk are capable to read at speed of 100MB/sec. It would take about ~7 seconds to transfer a common Ubuntu iso in the RAM: and this would include lot of unused stuff. A very bare bone reduced ARM Linux (with busybox) can [boot in ~300ms](http://www.makelinux.com/emb/fastboot/) \r\n[cut because it's too long otherwise]","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9026/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":1,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9025","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9025/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9025/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9025/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/9025","id":233252197,"number":9025,"title":"Circle and Capsule CollisionShape2D aren't drawn in 3.0","user":{"login":"NoGodDamnName","id":28677151,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/28677151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoGodDamnName","html_url":"https://github.com/NoGodDamnName","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoGodDamnName/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoGodDamnName/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoGodDamnName/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoGodDamnName/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoGodDamnName/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoGodDamnName/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoGodDamnName/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoGodDamnName/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoGodDamnName/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-06-02T17:42:00Z","updated_at":"2017-06-02T19:26:39Z","closed_at":"2017-06-02T19:26:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Currently, in 3.0 the bounding boxes for CollisionShape2D's Circle and Capsule aren't drawn anymore, but the handles are still there.
