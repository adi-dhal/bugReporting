is far from finished and very, very rough, but I figured I'd submit it for people to start taking a look at and coming up with better solutions for a few of the issues.\r\n\r\nFunctionality everything is there except for plane detection, that shouldn't be hard to add in. For me the main goal was to get the tracking up and running and the camera.\r\n\r\nThe camera isn't implemented the way I would like to, right now I'm taking the render buffer created by Godot and overlaying it ontop of the camera image during the final copy to screen. I don't believe this is the right way about it. I need to find a way to make the camera image available to the render engine so it can render the geometry on top of the image. The really annoying part here is that the image is provided by the camera as a YCbCr image so it needs to be converted to RGB. Since we get a new image almost every frame I'm doing this in the shader itself.\r\nBasically everything in arkit_shader.h and arkit_shader.cpp should be solved differently\r\n\r\nThe other thing which right now is fairly dirty is the way everything hangs together. For 90% ARKit actually works with a pull mechanism but the remaining 10% required some ugly hacks. I'll be cleaning that up soon.\r\n\r\nFinally there are a bunch of rendering issues but they are issues on iPhone in general. One specific to ARKit is that without a background (it being the camera image of the phone) there is no HDR image to do nice reflections with. I'm uploading a video to YouTube to show off the tracking, will post the link as soon as it finishes.\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/QCH5wOYeIdQ\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9967/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":9}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9966","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9966/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9966/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9966/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9966","id":246514483,"number":9966,"title":"PropertyEditor: Fix easing_curve blocking popup input","user":{"login":"Noshyaar","id":26753932,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/26753932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar","html_url":"https://github.com/Noshyaar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-07-29T10:46:56Z","updated_at":"2017-09-04T11:55:36Z","closed_at":"2017-07-29T16:55:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/9966","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9966","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9966.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9966.patch"},"body":"This fixes a bug where easing curve, while drawn behind presets popup, blocks mouse inputs.

know this isn't really a bug, but I think that this is important for Godot, more specifically its documentation and example projects\r\nhttps://github.com/HelloFangaming/HelloMarioEngine\r\nThis engine written in Game Maker Language is very good at explaining all things written in the object code that aren't immediately obvious from the GameMaker UI (which means such as which parent the object has, which default sprite the object uses, and which mask the object has). For example, the code explains an object's behaviors such as setting the object's creation parameters in the Create event (such as facing direction, which state of the FSM it is in when starting, and which qualities it has such as immune to fireballs, can be stomped, etc.) Speaking of those, it also helped me understand finite state machines in the step events, too (such as how an object changes graphics and movement behavior when it changes to a state, such as throwing, jumping, etc., and how they have variables such as having one sprite when jumping but switch to another when they land). I'm sorry for my fuzzy instructions, because it's been a while since I used that engine due to not wanting to continue development on a project that wasn't GPL-friendly. What I mean to be taken away from this is that I really appreciate when projects do not assume knowledge of the student, and that seeing the same \"you do this to x\" explanation in each object helped me get the concepts in a general sense.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9962/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9961","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9961/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9961/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9961/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/9961","id":246482735,"number":9961,"title":"Add HarfBuzz for text shaping","user":{"login":"bruvzg","id":7645683,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7645683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bruvzg","html_url":"https://github.com/bruvzg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bruvzg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bruvzg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bruvzg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bruvzg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bruvzg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bruvzg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bruvzg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bruvzg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bruvzg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-07-28T23:45:24Z","updated_at":"2017-08-18T10:14:12Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Change `DynamicFont` to use [HarfBuzz](https://github.com/behdad/harfbuzz) (MIT license) to handle:\r\n\r\n1.

On the desktop it runs smooth but on Android it slows down unusable. Without shadow and without shader.

I have exported a model from blender using both the default Collada Exporter and the Better Collada Exporter.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if this is related to issue #9562. The dae model only artifacts when Normal mapping is enabled.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n\r\n*3d workflow:*\r\n1.) Exported FBX model from ZBrush\r\n2.) FBX imported into blender, scaled at 100%\r\n3.) UV and materials finalized. Normals checked.\r\n\r\n*Godot importation:*\r\n4.) Exported 2 models from Blender directly into Godot Project folder, using the following methods:\r\n--------->a.) Blender's standard Collada .dae plugin\r\n--------->b.) Godot's Better Collada Exporter  \r\n\r\n*In the Godot Engine:*\r\n5.) Created a spacial material for the mesh.\r\n6.) Checked [/] Normal Map in the spacial materials parameters\r\n\r\nBy enabling Normal Map, both models get the exact same Normals artifacting issues in the same areas.\r\n\r\nI'm assuming it's the way collada handles normals?\r\n\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\n![artifacting](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17959437/28701286-08ec13dc-730a-11e7-9d20-42e633b40121.jpg)\r\n![issue2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17959437/28701878-0f66f99e-730e-11e7-988d-03bff6bb7628.png)\r\n\r\n[collada_artifacting_issue.tar.gz](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/1181951/collada_artifacting_issue.tar.gz) <- A minimal godot project containing the dae exports.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nChrisP","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9939/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4929","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"C2D8:572C:1501869:29B6203:59D69AA2","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=65>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=63>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"f8a5e039c8a1bab4561f9eb613fa6a41\"","status":"200 OK"}}
