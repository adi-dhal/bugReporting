Use cases might include something like [this](https://github.com/fluffrabbit/TestVRGUI). Imagine playing Marathon (you know, the game where you have to read a bunch of shit) with all the glory of Godot's BBcode support, clicking links and such, in virtual reality! Problem is, I'm not sure if those links can be clicked because in VR one does not use a mouse. One does not simply *mouse* into VR.\r\n\r\nI modified the GUI in 3D example to continuously send mouse clicks inside the _on_area_input event, rather than just *whatever* you *actually* do with the mouse. On the Web, which those fruitcakes at Mozilla seem to be pushing for, you can send a click event and you can do this or that to your heart's content because it's for babies, but Godot's GUI system is really stripped down. Holy shit, why even use it? I kid, I kid. It's April Fools' Day so I think I'm entitled to a little verbal kickboxing. So when you comment out line 33, suddenly no trabaja.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I hope I'm getting the point across. Need to generate MOUSE_BUTTON event from scratch in order to replace mouse with (for instance) key, cannot do so, angry.

changes the way the VisualServerScene organises instances by actually placing them on separate layers with their own octrees. This is a significant optimization specifically for this PR (https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8215) since you'll want to use this to mask certain objects on certain cameras, but cameras would be forced to traverse one massive octree regardless of what objects are important with the original. Now, a camera will only have to traverse and cull the layers specific to it. As a scenario, imagine you have two cameras for an FPS, one for the player's view (which would require traversing many objects), and one for the gun viewmodel, which only cares about one object. This removes the overhead of the gun camera having to traverse the entire octree. It does however operate under the assumption that the majority of VisualInstance will mostly be confined to one layer at a time, which is what most scenarios should only require.\r\n\r\nThere may be alternative techniques (and the culling system could probably do with a broader overhaul anyway), but this is the technique I've been using at it seems to work fine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8216/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8215","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8215/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8215/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8215/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8215","id":218555034,"number":8215,"title":"Support for multiple cameras per viewport.","user":{"login":"SaracenOne","id":12756047,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/12756047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne","html_url":"https://github.com/SaracenOne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":279098111,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:rendering","name":"topic:rendering","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/7","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/7","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/7/labels","id":2529217,"number":7,"title":"3.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":114,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2017-05-18T13:33:56Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T12:23:57Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":8,"created_at":"2017-03-31T16:36:08Z","updated_at":"2017-09-20T17:54:47Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/8215","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8215","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8215.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8215.patch"},"body":"Feature I spoke briefly with @reduz about including for the new renderer, although I've had this feature in my own branch for a while. It basically allows you to have multiple active 3D cameras for a single viewport which can be rendered one after another in an order specified by the new 'depth' parameter. By using this, you can create a variety of effects such as a first-person-shooter gun model which receives correct lighting but doesn't intersect with other geometry and can even have it's own independent FOV, or a mesh-based skybox rendered before everything else. The changes are fairly benign, but the multiple cameras can incur significant overhead in certain situations due to the way the VisualServerScene organises instances. To overcome this, I propose using the changes from this PR (https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8216).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8215/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8214","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8214/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8214/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8214/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8214","id":218535871,"number":8214,"title":"Made slide and reflect active verbs acting on itself in Vector2 and V…","user":{"login":"tagcup","id":16531565,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/16531565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagcup","html_url":"https://github.com/tagcup","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagcup/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagcup/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagcup/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagcup/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagcup/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagcup/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagcup/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagcup/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagcup/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097162,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/discussion","name":"discussion","color":"ee77ee","default":false},{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":16,"created_at":"2017-03-31T15:26:32Z","updated_at":"2017-04-09T19:09:08Z","closed_at":"2017-04-04T23:23:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/8214","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8214","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8214.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8214.patch"},"body":"…ector3.\r\n\r\nThis is in alignment with other functions in vector classes.\r\nAlso added checks for normalization, fixed the sign of reflect (which now corresponds to reflection along a plane mathematically), added bounce method and updated docs.\r\n\r\nFixes #8201.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8214/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8213","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8213/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8213/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8213/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8213","id":218475396,"number":8213,"title":"Initialize hat values for mapping and revert X360 mappings.
