Here is a list of changes:\n- Fixed zero count quantifiers failing.\n- Fixed infinite recursion if quantifying zero length tokens.\n- Fixed `$` (as a string pattern on its own) not matching.\n- Fixed look behind rewinding beyond the start of the string.\n- Added support for alternative back reference format `\\g{1}` similar to\n  Python. This allows digits to be used immediately after back references.\n- Number of capture groups are still limited to 9 by default but can now\n  be manually set, with option for no limit at all. (Python has no limit)\n- Curly bracket quantifiers `{0}` no longer interpreted as a literal\n  string if previous token is not quantifiable.

[x] the word (variable, method, etc) highlighting <b>(2.0.2)</b>\r\n- [ ] support for foreign characters (new editor font (Inconsolata is neat) + support through the whole engine)\r\n- [x] possibility to hide the script list and use tabs to switch between them (maybe even hide inspector ? - small screen mode) <b>(kubecz3k)</b>\r\n- [x] full screen mode, ability to switch between scripts that would appear as a list only when needed (similar as the idea above) <b>(purpleorangegames)</b>\r\n- [ ] improve autocomplete - extending script, Globals.get(\"\"), paths to resources <b>(jeremi360)</b>\r\n- [ ] ability to move scripts up/down in the script list <b>(kubecz3k)</b>\r\n- [ ] ability to move between opened scripts on the script list from the keyboard <b>(kubecz3k)</b>\r\n- [ ] automatic scrolling when I hit the first line in text selection mode (pressed left mouse button + drag)\r\n- [x] numpad arrow/home/end/pgup/pgdn should work as usual when numlock is off <b>(grigi)</b> (Already added by #3269)\r\n- [ ] copy-on-select, and paste with middle-click (maybe optional?) <b>(grigi)</b>\r\n- [x] tab should enter spaces instead of a tab character (optional mode?) <b>(grigi)</b>\r\n- [ ] ability to collapse bundled lines of code (ifs, functions, etc.) <b>(Todor Imreorov via FB)</b> #2732\r\n-  [x] go to implementation (jump to the implementation of highlighted function - Shift+F1 works only for built-in functions) <b>(puppetmaster)</b> #3238 #4886\r\n- [ ] split editor horizontally/vertically **(vnen)** #5315\r\n- [ ] Less aggressive error highlighting **(DriNeo)** #7502\r\n-

1: will godot ever change to LeftHand?\n**Question 2: will the below codechanges create problems** (more important question) :)\n\ni wondered why u dont expose the Left Hand coord system to the user,\nknowing openGl is using right hand, but this only because the proj matrix does so.\n\ni hope i dont stamp me to a noob, non geek, tipex user, ...\nbut isnt LH not much more intuitive? (to normal humans, not 3d geeks) ;)\n\nsince i actually porting/rewriting code from my old directX and unity projects, i dont want to convert,\nso i tried abit with godot, and changed\ncamera_matrix.cpp\n\n``` c\nvoid CameraMatrix::set_perspective(float p_fovy_degrees, float p_aspect, float p_z_near, float p_z_far,bool p_flip_fov) {\n...\n    //matrix[2][2] = -(p_z_far + p_z_near) / deltaZ;\n    //matrix[2][3] = -1;\n    matrix[2][2] = (p_z_far + p_z_near) / deltaZ;\n    matrix[2][3] = 1;\n...\n```\n\nto make all LH. ( i know this hack only working for perspective )\nbut this need some thinking about it, do i run into future problems?\ni know TriangleCulling changes ( to the one i actually use in dx and unity)\nmesh culling and lightning still seem to work (as expected)\nis there anything else ive to think about, when doing this?\nfor example math (LookAt, vector.cross, rotations, quaternion, ....) \nor the physics server (not worked with it yet) or anything else?\n\ngreets & thanks in advance \nand remember going forward with RH is going back! :)  or left instead of right... :P\nwhat if i need my mousehand and have to imagine some 3d sh...err things :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2979","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2979/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2979/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2979/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2979","id":120188532,"number":2979,"title":"[SOLVED]

there are things like:\nglBufferSubData and glMapBufferRange (seems to be slower)\n\nor should a \"changeable mesh\" be composed of multiple smaller meshChunks (surfaces) to achieve\nless vertex data

a problem when creating a meshInstance from a mesh (using visual server directly)\nif i provide a transform that has a scale not (x/x/x) then it seems the normals arent updated/scaled.\nis this on purpose? or just not supported yet? or do i make a missasumption?\n\nmaybe its because of my splatmapshader, im using a shader only with fragment code,\nand there i only set DIFFUSE, and uniform in some textures and params.\n\ni dont have a project i could add here (yet), because im developing a module in c++\n\nas an example:\nwhen i have a terrain in size 500/20/500, and a heightmap 100/100\nthen i create a terrain mesh 0..100/0..1/0..100 (where 0..1 is the height from heightmap)\nwhen creating the the meshinstance for it, ive to scale it from 100/1/100 to 500/20/500\n\nbut when doin this, the light is the same all over the terrain, \nbecause the normals are all very steep \nthats because of height is only 0..1, \nso deltaheights (y) for a triangle are very small, compared to tris x/z => steep normal)\nwhen i fake the normals to reflect the scale all is ok... \nbut what if the user changes the scale or size of the terrain...then i have to update the mesh...i dont think it should work this way...\ni also could generate the mesh in the \"correct\" size or \"aspect ratio\" i may need to do it as a workaround, but still not very cool...\n\ngreets and tnx in
