At some point, going on with them the same as with the ray shape it just stuck, and never come move.\nThis effect is very often occur when the grid moves along the map surface, it is possible that this is happening at the moment when shape reaches the junction point between the tiles of static bodies of grid map.\nBy the way a lot of problems also occur when sphere shape or capsule shape, touch the walls of which have a boss or pimple, and then it stuck as a result, but sometimes from the bulge, you can retreat, and again move freely.\n\nTo see how it breaks in the demo kinematic_char_3D,
