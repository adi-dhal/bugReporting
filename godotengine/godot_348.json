could reproduce the crash described in #1284 only with 32bits versions of godot.\n\nThe test scene contains a Plane collision shape, and a kinematicsbody with a Sphere collision shape.\n\nThe crash occurs into `CollisionSolverSW::solve_distance_plane()` on line 299 when `p_shape_A` is a `PlaneShapeSW` object and when `p_shape_B` is a `MotionShapeSW` object, because `int support_count;` is not initialized by default, and because `MotionShapeSW::get_supports()` does not change `support_count` once passed as referenced parameter, and if the default value of `support_count` is greater than the length of `supports[16]`.\n\nI don't know if it is the good way to fix it because i'm not skilled ennough with the physics server inner working, but this fix prevents the crash and the test-scene seems to work correctly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1445","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1445/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1445/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1445/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/1445","id":59094250,"number":1445,"title":"tooltip

On high-elevation maps, you could make it so the flat areas have snow.\n\nAnother thing to possible add (not mentioned in the title), is to have a second new output for normal data in space local to the object (for objects that might rotate).\n\nThirdly, it would also be good to have a third new output that colors the mesh based on the angle of the normal to the camera (for fresnal effects). Finally, one should go through what it available as data outputs right now and see if there's any that may not have much of an actual use (or no one plans to use and see if that can be taken out),
