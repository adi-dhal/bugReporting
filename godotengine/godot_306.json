This reduces build time by a factor of 3 on my machine, which is a godsend! (3 instead of 9 minutes for a full rebuild). This resulted in an error before.\n\nEverything works fine. A single *.pdb gets generated. release_debug builds with tools included are running fine. The executable has a size of 15.2 MB, which is quite smaller than the older builds. This is because there was a linker error which forced me to link to the c runtime dynamically. But this should be preferred anyway.\n\nFor reference: I'm Using Visual Studio 2015 Enterprise on Windows 10.\n\nI remember, that there was a problem when Visual Studio 2013 and 2015 were installed on the same machine.

This basically causes the _update_shape signal to add the same area multiple times to the same body object. A very quick test for this is to change the shape of an area in combine mode after _ready (even setting it as the same value it used to be).\n\nIf you want a very simple demo project to test both the

Bug is with us for at least couple days since I also tested it on d123c89c5802777e02402108d9271ed2f29368fe. \nBecause of this bug it's impossible to use inherited scene feature (don't know any workaround).\n\n_Further notes:_\n**I have found commit that introduced this issue:** Issue was introduced in 884d5a0f41032a9c5c793577b82998998b3f87a0 commit. In fba1842b111420d75cfabc9dc4f240965cb085fe it's working fine.\nIt seems the bug is during writing/saving the scenes since I'm able to open scenes saved with little older Godot versions.\n\n_Steps to reproduce:_\n1. Create new scene, name it \"BaseScene.xscn\", put one node inside\n2. Create inherited scene with base as \"BaseScene.xscn\", add one node.\n3. Save it as \"InheritedScene.xscn\"\n4. Close tabs and try to reopen \"InheritedScene.xscn\"\n\n_TestCase project:_\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/168251/godot/some/issues/InheritanceSceneError.7z\n_Quick prof video:_\nhttps://youtu.be/xziKXmWDFZ4\n\nEdit:\nHere is godot editor console log when trying to open inherited scene:\n\n```\nERROR: set_current_tab: Index p_current out of size (get_tab_count()).\n   At: scene/gui/tabs.cpp:500.\nTextureButton: 16,-4\nLabel: 128,63\nHBoxContainer: 59,25\nERROR: remove_scene: Index p_idx out of size (edited_scene.size()).\n   At:

an important issue, but should be mentioned regardless)_\r\n\r\n**How to replicate the problem:**\r\n1. Start New Project (_optional_)\r\n2. Create Node type \"SamplePlayer\".\r\n3. In the Inspector, under \"Config\"->\"Samples\", change from _<null>_ to _New SampleLibrary_.\r\n4. Click it again and select \"Edit\".\r\n\r\nThis will overlap your current page with the sample library page.\r\nYou are unable to leave this page by clicking on the tabs; 2D, 3D, Script or Help - so you are forced to finish whatever you are doing. A way I have found to leave this page (when not doing anything) it is by clicking on any node in the Scene window. \r\n\r\nWorth mentioning there is no indication of where you are (not counting inside the Inspector window). No title saying \"Sample Library\" or some other information to tell the user what \"page\" is he on. (Granted; most people usually know where they are and how they got there, but let us pretend the user is a dummy and create a user friendly program!)  :)\r\n\r\nA suggestion to remedy this might be to make it _appear in a new window_ instead of replacing whatever page/tab you are currently in.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2677","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2677/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2677/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2677/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/2677","id":113239068,"number":2677,"title":"X11 -- Fixing memleaks","user":{"login":"phobos-tro","id":15309592,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/15309592?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phobos-tro","html_url":"https://github.com/phobos-tro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phobos-tro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phobos-tro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phobos-tro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phobos-tro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phobos-tro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phobos-tro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phobos-tro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phobos-tro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phobos-tro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-10-25T17:41:26Z","updated_at":"2015-10-26T08:12:26Z","closed_at":"2015-10-25T19:03:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/2677","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/2677","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/2677.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/2677.patch"},"body":"Fixed some memory leaks for the X11 platform.\n\nTested with the clang++ & g++ compilers with \"godot/demos/misc/window_management\".\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2677/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4687","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"A700:01FA:B5B2DB:198B7E9:59D69E8F","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=307>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=305>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"2fb06becb4cc4321ca384eb8cfd58625\"","status":"200 OK"}}
