3.0 master\r\nWindows 10 64 bits\r\n\r\nI went through a bit of confusion while trying to create a project:\r\n\r\n1) Open project manager\r\n2) Create new project\r\n3) Click \"Browse\" to pick a folder\r\n4) On Windows, it opens by default in C:/Users/name, I want it to be in D:/something/uuhSomething/IDontRemember, so I try to click \"/..\", but it doesn't do anything, unlike any file explorer on Windows.\r\n5) I decide to edit the path just to show the files in D:/ then:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1311555/29586530-3f8e1576-878b-11e7-9750-42b07a995b21.png)\r\n\r\nAt this point, the file list doesn't update, so I intuitively think that pressing \"Enter\" in the field would update the list...\r\nWrong! The dialog closes and the project ends up being created in D:/ while i didn't finish to find my folder.\r\n\r\nThen I noticed that small drop down, which does what I wanted:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1311555/29586604-98f4063e-878b-11e7-991b-e7a9aa1707c8.png)\r\n\r\nWhen I think about it, I understand the top URL textbox is the prompted directory and pressing enter will choose it, but for some reason I thought of it like a URL only used to show the file list below, like any other file explorer and browsers, and I thought the actual input field was the one at the bottom.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1311555/29586884-80a14c8a-878c-11e7-804e-d5170369b2f5.png)\r\n\r\nThat one is completely useless when looking for a folder.\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be more consistent if the top path was only \"where you are\" with no \"Enter closes dialog\", and the bottom path was the actual folder you want to choose/create?

is a work in progress (**DON'T MERGE**).\r\n\r\nNot optimized, require cleanup.\r\n\r\nThis PR uses portions of [ICU](http://site.icu-project.org/) and [HarfBuzz](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/HarfBuzz/) libraries, to implement rendering of bi-direction text, complex scripts and OpenType typographic features.\r\n\r\n### Current status:\r\n![text_rendering_is_easy_and_fun](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7645683/30828802-7fac0a74-a247-11e7-8a3e-8b49e0814b5a.png)\r\nNot implemented parts are grayed-out.\r\n\r\n### Commit 1: ICU and HarfBuzz libraries\r\n\r\n### Commit 2: `ParagraphLayout` class, `IntervalTree` class and underlying `dynamic_font` changes.\r\n\r\nFunctional, some features missing.\r\n\r\nTakes string, font and other information, such as base text direction, language and script, preform bidi reordering, line breaking (whitespace<sup>1</sup> only, will not work for scripts with no separator character such as Thai, ICU have [UAX #14](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/) implementation, but it is not currently integrated), context specific shaping and return `cluster`<sup>2</sup> lists in visual and logical order.\r\n\r\nEach `cluster` contains original string character range, list of glyphs<sup>3</sup> with offsets, cluster visual position and size.\r\n\r\n#### Usage:\r\n```c++\r\n        //Setup paragraph\r\n        ParagraphLayout vt;\r\n\tvt.set_text(p_text, p_direction);\r\n\tvt.set_font(p_font);\r\n\tvt.set_lang(p_lang);            // optional: ISO 639 (*4) language code\r\n        vt.set_max_width(p_width);      // optional: enable autowrap\r\n\tvt.set_ot_features(p_features); // optional: Comma-separated list of 4-letter typographic feature tags (*5/*6);\r\n\r\n        //Analyse paragraph\r\n        vt.analyse_paragraph();         // optional: will be automatically called on first draw if required\r\n\r\n        //Draw paragraph\r\n        for (int i = 0; i < vt.get_line_count(); i++) {\r\n                const Vector<Ref<ClusterInfo> > &vo = vt.get_visual_order(i);\r\n                for (int j = 0; j < vo.size(); j++) {\r\n                        p_font->draw_cluster(canvas_item, Point2(x_ofs, y_ofs), vo[j], color);\r\n                }\r\n                y_ofs += line_spacing;\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n<sup>1</sup> whitespace - Unicode separator characters, tabulation, form/line feed, carriage return, but not a non-breaking space.\r\n<sup>2</sup> cluster - smallest indivisible linguistic unit.\r\n<sup>3</sup> glyph - individual image/outline in a font.\r\n<sup>4</sup> [ISO 639](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639)\r\n<sup>5</sup> [OpenType typographic

text, base_direction, features, script, lang, color);` to access `ParagraphLayout` in easy way.\r\n\r\n![t1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7645683/30030550-8a18ccd4-9196-11e7-88e6-754ca6aee978.png)\r\n\r\n#### Usage:\r\n```\r\nfunc _draw():\r\n        draw_bidi_string(font, pos, text, base_direction, features, script, lang, color);\r\n```\r\n#### Demo project:\r\n[BidiTest.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/1274940/BidiTest.zip)\r\n\r\n### Commits 4-5: Modified
