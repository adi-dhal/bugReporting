Is there a way to add a function to the 3D Camera Node to create an array of separate 3D viewing layers to import and place the 3D objects within? Without sacrificing light and shadow detail?\n\nThis may have been an advanced suggestion to ask as a feature, but it would be useful for creating 3D Heads Up Display GUI in one 3d viewing layer and the arms/limbs holding a weapon or object in another separate layer.

Godot version:**\nOS is N/A.\nGodot 2.2 Alpha (Git)\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nIf supplying one of the stream node play functions (and probably other related nodes/functions like set_stream) a file that is invalid for it to play back, it reports on the debugger that it is ERR_FILE_UNRECOGNIZED. It does not, however, actually return this value to the application itself.\n\nIt would be nice if the set_stream/play and related functions (for example, StreamPlayer.play) could also return this and other appropriate ERR_ values so that any calling function/node could respond accordingly - for example, a music player application could remove the offending file from its playlists.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6202","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6202/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6202/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6202/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6202","id":171963085,"number":6202,"title":"Offset in PathFollow infinite increment","user":{"login":"BalamChaac","id":3739079,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3739079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalamChaac","html_url":"https://github.com/BalamChaac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalamChaac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalamChaac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalamChaac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalamChaac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalamChaac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalamChaac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalamChaac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalamChaac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalamChaac/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097162,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/discussion","name":"discussion","color":"ee77ee","default":false},{"id":279537176,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/hacktoberfest","name":"hacktoberfest","color":"00eeee","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-08-18T18:01:31Z","updated_at":"2016-12-08T18:31:03Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device -

enabled, all `do`/`undo` operations stay in separate actions.\n- `MERGE_ENDS`: When enabled, the action `do` operation is from the first action one created and the `undo` operation is from the last subsequent action with the same name.\n- `MERGE_ALL`: When  enabled, the `do`/`undo` operations in a set of subsequent actions, with the same name, are merged into one. \n\nCloses #4061, and possibly
