I saw\n\nhttp://www.godotengine.org/wp/webassembly-godot-on-the-web/\n\nwhich mentions asm.js issues. I'm one of the emscripten devs, and I'd like to help if you're interested.\n\nSpecifically I saw problems with Chrome and IE/Edge mentioned. Edge's latest prerelease version has asm.js optimizations enabled by default, and also has excellent WebGL perf, so I hope that Microsoft is no longer a problem, leaving only Chrome.\n\nWe should be able to run Godot well even on Chrome. What were the specific problems you encountered?\n\nA common issue recently have been memory limitations on Chrome. I've been doing memory optimization work specifically for that, with some significant improvements (half the memory at peak in my tests), and I could help test that on Godot, if you want.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2416","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2416/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2416/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2416/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2416","id":104657731,"number":2416,"title":"can_move_to seems not working","user":{"login":"zoiba","id":5225262,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5225262?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoiba","html_url":"https://github.com/zoiba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoiba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoiba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoiba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoiba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoiba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoiba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoiba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoiba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoiba/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279128044,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/confirmed","name":"confirmed","color":"66dd66","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2015-09-03T09:46:45Z","updated_at":"2015-12-08T20:09:47Z","closed_at":"2015-12-08T20:09:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm trying to check if a kinetic body can move to a determined position, can_move_to() should be the perfect choice for doing this but it seems not working properly.\nI've made a test case for illustrating that.

zoom (and it has nothing to do with the render settings in the project settings window or the clip values). The one thing that I know is quite consistent is that this never seems to be a problem if you have the camera pointed straight down or you have the camera looking out from near the center of the scene (coordinates being close to 0,0,0), but mainly if the camera starts going further from the origin and is looking at a shallower angle. I also notice that when I zoom, there seems to be a window where the objects are invisible, I can start with the objects being visible, then zoom out and see them go invisible and then visible again.\n![godotbug1a](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10081256/9569453/9fec5a8e-4f31-11e5-904e-78a071f35afd.jpg) ![godotbug1b](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10081256/9569456/a6e677de-4f31-11e5-98b9-85b0f9edbd8c.jpg)\n\nI am treating this as a bug because I do not think this is intentional behavior that can simply be fixed with a setting change. I hope it can be fixed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2408/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2407","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2407/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2407/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2407/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2407","id":103943475,"number":2407,"title":"Exported game conflict with engine - windows","user":{"login":"AlexHolly","id":4741886,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4741886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexHolly","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexHolly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexHolly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexHolly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexHolly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexHolly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexHolly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexHolly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexHolly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexHolly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexHolly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2015-08-30T20:14:06Z","updated_at":"2015-08-30T22:41:44Z","closed_at":"2015-08-30T22:40:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"1.
