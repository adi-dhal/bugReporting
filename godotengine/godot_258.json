I filed that as a separate issue, since gyro has application in a wider spectrum of apps - not only vr/ar.\nhttps://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4138\n\nA stereoscopic camera simply splits the device screen into two screens - one for the left and one for the right eyes. The user can then put their mobile device into a google cardboard unit (costs 5$ on ebay) and use it as a VR headset. With some of the later models with better screen users can really get an experience closer to the more expensive headsets (oculus and vive).\n\nMy guess is that this is already becoming the widest spread form of vr experience because of it's low entry price tag.

system or device:**\nArch Linux\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nIt appears that whenever I save a scene file in the editor(so far tested with TSCN and XML formats) in addition to whatever changes I make, additional changes are introduced, and this happens even if I don't make any changes myself. The changes seem to be related to sub_resources, e.g., their IDs get switched and occur all over the file. This complicates committing changes to scenes in an SCM system, making it a choice between making a messy commit or sorting what was intentional change and what wasn't each time. \nIf it's an intended feature, there should be a way to disable it, or at at least a way to diff the scene while ignoring these changes should be provided.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nSeems to occur with scenes that have multiple nodes and resources. It's enough to just open the scene and immediately save it in the editor. The scene file registers as changed after that. Tested on v.2.0.1\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\n Can be reproduced with the [platformer demo](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/tree/master/demos/2d/platformer).\nSample diffs of the occurring changes on a scene from my project and from the platformer demo:\nhttps://gist.github.com/Srogozins/f867df7c60c5bcfe3790\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4125","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4125/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4125/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4125/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4125","id":142789729,"number":4125,"title":"Android crash on scene loading with relative path","user":{"login":"DriNeo","id":12350741,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12350741?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DriNeo","html_url":"https://github.com/DriNeo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DriNeo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DriNeo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DriNeo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DriNeo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DriNeo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DriNeo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DriNeo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DriNeo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DriNeo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-03-22T21:45:05Z","updated_at":"2017-02-15T13:51:39Z","closed_at":"2017-02-15T13:51:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device:**\nAndroid 4.0.3 ;  LG P700\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nWhen some scenes are loaded by script, the Android app crashes on startup.
