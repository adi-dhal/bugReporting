The new VS C++ code generator apparently likes to schedule calls of the same function together, so now it emits that line as the equivalent of:\r\n\r\n`Variant& temp1 = d[\"radius\"];`\r\n`Variant& temp2 = d[\"height\"];`\r\n`float temp3 = temp1.operator float();`\r\n`float temp4 = temp2.operator float();`\r\n`_setup(temp4, temp3);`\r\n\r\n\"d\" is mutable, and indexing a mutable dictionaries always copies and deletes the original if it's unreferenced elsewhere, so by the time temp1 is converted, the lookup of \"height\" has already invalidated the memory location looked up from \"radius\", and the case I was seeing, its type was stomped with 0.\r\n\r\nSo, this might not be a problem in 3.0 since that functionality is gone in master, but it can affect 2.1.  It's hard to really tell how widespread it is, but searching for [\" yields a decent number of cases.\r\n\r\nThe simplest solution I think is to just make dictionaries not copy if their reference count is 1, which would prevent it from relocating its contents after the first access as long as none of the other accesses insert a key.  It should probably do anyway since right now it's doing a copy of the entire dictionary on every mutable access.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8161","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8161/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8161/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8161/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8161","id":217069011,"number":8161,"title":"Add \"On Top\" flag to Sprite3D (2.1)","user":{"login":"elasota","id":1137273,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1137273?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasota","html_url":"https://github.com/elasota","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasota/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasota/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasota/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasota/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasota/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasota/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasota/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasota/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasota/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":311852125,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/needs%20rebase","name":"needs rebase","color":"bb7777","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":279098111,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:rendering","name":"topic:rendering","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":9,"created_at":"2017-03-26T17:38:43Z","updated_at":"2017-08-24T21:26:38Z","closed_at":"2017-08-24T21:26:37Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/8161","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8161","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8161.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8161.patch"},"body":"Adds \"On Top\" flag to Sprite3D.

either.\r\n\r\nAn optional property to steal focus on show and a path to return it on hide will be good to have on the Popup node branch (or maybe deeper, like in WindowDialog) and may help to solve issues like #8149, also facilitating common key/pad menu navigation on games and other kind of programs.\r\n\r\nI know this can be done by the programmer but such a common behavior I think should be there, like the \"exclusive\" property.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n- On the example project, use up and down to enjoy keyboard navigation over the buttons.\r\n- Press enter/return over the buttons that open Popup or FileDialog\r\n- Continue enjoying keyboard navigation over the buttons while it should be somewhere else.\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThis can be quickly tested on the
