3.0 master, also 2.1.3\r\nWindows 10 64 bits\r\n\r\nI don't know wether this is fixable or not, but on Windows I always noticed a slightly better response time / better framerate when \"update always\" was checked on top-right. To the point I always checked it when taking videos. Now I see the option is going to be deprecated and default to \"update changes\", which finally convinced me to open this issue for the record.\r\n\r\nI noticed this in many situations, for example scrolling the script editor, and took a video of it to show the difference: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/10489#issuecomment-325166871\r\n\r\n~~@toger5 didn't experience this on Mac, so it might be OS-specific.~~\r\n\r\nI just tried to record a video of it in the 3D viewport but I was unable to make the difference stand out much with OBS, because on my laptop it slows down FPS just enough, which is frustrating...\r\nI retried with tweaked settings: http://zylannprods.fr/dl/godot/subtle_framerate_difference.mp4\r\n(but the most measurable example is the script editor).\r\n\r\nIt feels like the editor reacts and redraws at 40..50 fps / drops frames, instead of 60 when I set \"update changes\", which is subtle, but noticeable.\r\nEdit: it's also easily seen when resizing
