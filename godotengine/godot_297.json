follows:\n    1) onlymesh.dae-----Sphere\n    Result:  both works in godot and unity with import 3d scene \n    2)onemesh onjoint.dae-- one mesh with two joints, so one skeleton\n    Result: both works in godot and unity.\n   3)onemesh onjoint skin.dae -- one mesh, two joints, with skin\n   Result: godot import error\n  4)onemesh onjoint animation.dae -- one mesh, two joints, with skin and skeleton animation\n   Result: godot import error, unity import , but can not play skeleton animation\n\n  Also, as I saw the notes somewhere:\n        make sure that\n        -meshes are child of skeleton\n       -mesh transform (offset, rotation, scale) in regards to skeleton is zero\n\nI create samples with skeleton as mesh's parent:\n    1)onemesh onjoint parent.dae-- make skeleton as

You have BaseScene.xscn that has a script \"BaseScript.gd\".\n2. You have a scene \"ExtendedScene.xscn\" that inherit from BaseScene.xscn and have a \"ExtendedScript.gd\" script that inherit from BaseScript.gd.\n3. If in BaseScript.gd you will have any exported variable you wont be able to hold in \"ExtendedScene.xscn\" default value of this variable.\n\nVideo for quick

say we have:\n- a spatial as the world\n- a static body as the map \n- a kinematic body as the player\n\nThe player collides with the map with the method move(motion), so it doesn't get through walls and the ground. If the root node, the world, has a translation = (0,0,0), everything is fine. But if it has a translation (x,y,z), everytime the player enters in collision with the map, for instance at the landing of a jump, the player suddenly moves with the translation of its parent, the world. So, if the world has a translation (1,0,0), the move method from the kinematic body will add this (1,0,0) to the kinematic body, but only when it detects a new collision with something else. This bug doesn't happens when there was already a collision (like standing on the ground because of gravity) or when there's no collision (falling or flying).\n\nAlso if the kinematic body has multiple parents, the sum of the parents' translation is the distance the body will move. Therefore it moves according to the absolute translation of the immediat parent of the kinematic body. Adding an intermediate spatial node with translation=(0,0,0) is useless. And setting the root node's translation to (0,0,0) doesn't matter either if one parent of the kinematic body has a translation not (0,0,0).\n\nThe obvious workaround is to insure that every parent of kinematic nodes has a translation = (0,0,0). But it can be quite inconvenient, especially for mobs.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2948","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2948/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2948/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2948/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2948","id":119351629,"number":2948,"title":"tscn/tres: Can't open tileset source scene nor use exported tileset resource in tscn/tres formats","user":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279128044,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/confirmed","name":"confirmed","color":"66dd66","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/1/labels","id":1381437,"number":1,"title":"2.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":444,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-10-28T13:37:45Z","updated_at":"2017-07-28T10:44:22Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2017-07-28T10:44:22Z"},"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-11-29T10:50:11Z","updated_at":"2016-04-24T15:06:37Z","closed_at":"2015-12-12T20:11:29Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"I can't say for sure that this is related to tilesets, or if it's just that my tileset scene happens to use a feature that the tscn/tres parser does not handle properly.\n\nTo reproduce the issue, you can clone: https://github.com/akien-mga/dynadungeons\n\nThere is already a scenes/tileset.tscn file there that Godot is not able to open.
