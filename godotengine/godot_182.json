Because of this I'm unable to create an example, but it's pretty straight forward to recreate.\n\nA stranger version of this bug actually occurred in my main project, except it didn't cause Godot to crash. Instead it caused the player (Kinematic) to fall straight through the static body below it. As soon as I changed the Initial Angle value on the TextureProgress bar I was using to a valid value like 0 , the problem went away and collisions worked again.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n\nAdd a TextureProgress node to any scene, the default value in the Initial Angle box under Radial Fill will be \"-nan\".

suggestion is to implement a button which would collapse the view of all the tracks into a single track.  The purpose of this is for cutting up a strip of animation which contains multiple 'actions' e.g. a strip which has the walk cycle, attack cycle, jump cycle all in the same strip.\n\nWhen cutting up a strip now, if there are more tracks than fit within the track window, even if extended, you have to scroll down mid selection to get the tracks that weren't visible.  If the tracks could be collapsed into a single track, you would be able to select all tracks at once.\n\nLook at blender's action/ dope sheet frame tracks.

`GDScript.stepify` or `Vector2.snapped` (rounded to the closest number).\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nRunning a script with the following lines:\n\n```\n    print(\"original      :
