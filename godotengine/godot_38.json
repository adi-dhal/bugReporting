(Readability)\r\n\r\n> _rotate_left\r\n\r\n- Added a comment to explain when null should be thrown. (Readability)\r\n\r\n> _rotate_right\r\n\r\n- Moved the if statement outside the while clause. The if statement will only be true when trying to find the predecessor of the first node in the tree. Assuming we are trying to find the first node's predecessor. By removing the if statement, the while loop will break when node = _data._root. So we can do the check outside the while loop, by checking when node == _data._root, and return NULL. (Performance)\r\n\r\n> _find\r\n\r\n- When node is found, return it immediately. So the check outside the while loop doesn't need to run before returning the node. (Performance)\r\n\r\n> _lower_bound\r\n\r\n- When node is found, return it immediately. So the check outside the while loop doesn't need to run before returning the node. (Performance)\r\n\r\n- The while loop will only break when `node == _data._nil`, so we don't need to run `if (node == _data._nil)`. (Performance)\r\n\r\n> _insert\r\n\r\n- Move `r_exists = false` closer to the place where `r_exists = true`, so it's easier to compare when it is set. (Readability)\r\n\r\n> _insert_rb\r\n\r\n- Use an nparent and ngrand_parent variable to try and make the following code more readable. (Readability)\r\n\r\n- The `aux` variable was removed. `aux` is essentially parent's sibling, so instead of `aux` we use `ngrand_parent` (left or right depending on which is the sibling). (Simplify)\r\n\r\n- The function uses the new variable names, but also has to set the `nparent` and `ngrand_parent` variables whenever they change. (Readability)\r\n\r\n> _erase_fix\r\n\r\n- This version of `_erase_fix` should only run when the leaf node being removed from the tree is black and has two nil node children. So we would always know that node replacing it is `_data._nil`. Hence `node = _data._nil`. (Reliability)\r\n\r\n- We now want the sibling node as input, instead of the replacement node. If we did use the replacement node, it would be `_data._nil` from the above point. The current implementation sets `_data._nil`'s parent in `_erase` before passing it to this function; in order to access its position in the tree (through the parent). By using the sibling, we guarantee sibling is non-nil, and have access to node's parent without having to change `_data._nil`. (Reliability)\r\n\r\n- The while loop is essentially the same as the current implementation, but refactored. It is looking for a red node so it can resolve the black depth count issue. The moment it finds one, it will resolve the black depth count and exit the loop through a break. If it exits due to `node != root`, then the black tree depth of the whole tree would have been reduced by 1. (Logical)\r\n\r\n- We don't need the last `_set_color(node, BLACK)` any more as the color issue should be solved in the while loop. (Simplify)\r\n\r\n> _erase\r\n\r\n- Use `p_node->_next` instead of `_successor(p_node)`, as it should be set to the output of successor anyway. (Performance)\r\n\r\n- Remove `if (!rp)` statement as the check for null values will be in the functions that use `_erase`. (Consistency)\r\n\r\n- Remove `if (_data._root == node)` as it isn't needed as `if (rp == rp->parent->left)` does the same thing. (Reliability)\r\n\r\n- The red and black tree colors are dealt with in the `if (node->color == RED)` section. There are 3 valid leaf node types: (1) Removing a Red node with two nil children. (2) Removing a black node with one red child and one nil child. (3) Removing a black node with two nil children. If (1) No color changes are needed. If (2) we replace the removed node with the red node, and change its color to black. If (3) we run `_erase_fix` which sorts out the more complicated recoloring. (Readability)\r\n\r\n- If substituting the required node back into the tree, we just run a check on setting the child node's parent as the child could be `_data._nil`, and we don't want to change the nil node. (Reliability)\r\n\r\n> erase\r\n\r\n- Add a null check to the method as `_erase` doesn't check for null. (Reliability)\r\n\r\n> clear\r\n\r\n- Removed `_data._nil->parent = _data.nil` as nil's parent shouldn't have been changed.

patch generates VS project files for the default version of Visual Studio that is installed on the build machine. It uses SCons functions to determine what the default version of VS/VC is. This means that SCons 2.5.* will not detect a VS2017 installation and fall back to VS2015. SCons 3.0 alpha generates projects for VS2017 if it is installed. (More precisely, if VS2017 is installed in such a way that it is recognized as the default, which should typically be the case even if both VS2015 and VS2017 are available).\r\n\r\nWhereas previously the value of the `-j` flag was hardcoded to 2, the VS build now uses the same number of threads as the SCons run that generated the solution files.\r\n\r\nAnother change to the previous behavior is that the path to the batch file that sets up the VS environment is now generated when the `SConstruct` file is run; previously it queried the value of the environment variable `VCInstallDir` when building Godot. I don't think this change matters, but it might impact people who have strange VS2015 setups. \r\n\r\nI've also refactored the code a bit to avoid the extremely long and repetitive strings in the source and fixed (what I believe was) a minor bug: one of the command lines used `&` instead of `^&` in one place, and I could see no real reason for this difference.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10727/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10726","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10726/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10726/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10726/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/10726","id":253380998,"number":10726,"title":"There's no way to set stream loop on/off from inspector","user":{"login":"razvanc-r","id":1177508,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1177508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/razvanc-r","html_url":"https://github.com/razvanc-r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razvanc-r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razvanc-r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razvanc-r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razvanc-r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razvanc-r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razvanc-r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razvanc-r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razvanc-r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razvanc-r/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":572781997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:audio","name":"topic:audio","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-08-28T16:18:43Z","updated_at":"2017-08-28T16:59:47Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Operating system or device, Godot version, GPU Model and driver (if graphics related):**\r\nUbuntu 17.04 - Godot v3.0.alpha.custom_build.3ae1cff\r\n\r\nI used `.ogg` by loading the stream from disk.
