Godot only seems to support transparent textures which don't use depth buffering and are instead depth sorted. This works okay for some simple cases, but the lack of depth buffering can really bite you if you have, for example, intersecting transparent geometry, which may render inconsistently.\r\n\r\nIn OpenGL it is possible to test the alpha value of a pixel when writing to the depth buffer, and thus have working depth buffering for transparent textures, albeit this is only suited to 1-bit transparency (all pixels either fully opaque or fully transparent).\r\n\r\nGodot supporting depth-buffered transparency would be very useful to me. I wanted to make a game which used 2D pixel art sprites in a 3D environment, but having to rely on depth sorting rather than depth buffering caused all sorts of unfixable rendering

different color for each corner.\r\n\r\n## how it works:\r\n\r\nold version:\r\n~~I draw rounded rectangles by first adding circles in the corners with the right offset and the right radius. than I draw four rectangles for each edge. (need for because it supports different radius for each corner).~~\r\n\r\nI draw rounded rings by creating two arrays of certs which have a defined gap between them and fill them with polygons + set the color according to settings (if border_blend inner and outer arrays have different colors)\r\nI also use that function to draw the shadow. with outer color = transparent\r\nThe aa will be done by creating another outer ring around the border and the center which will fade to transparent too.\r\nThe infill has other indexing logic but I also generate a vertex array in the shape of a rounded ring. just one though and than fill it with triangles from right to left.\r\n\r\n## issues:\r\n - [x] empty centers are not possible with rounded corners the circles are no than inside the circle:\r\n<img width=\"1680\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-05-24 at 13 54 41\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16718859/26425705/ae471a78-408a-11e7-818d-3cea2a22b899.png\"> this could be fixed if I have some kind of masking feature, or if I draw 90 degree arc's instead of circles for style boxes without center... (second might be easiest)\r\n\r\n - [x] the history needs some cleanup\r\n- [x] There is an issue with the circle drawing. it seems like only every second (or random...) circle is drawn. It works when I just do draw 2 circles on top of each other... which I do right not.\r\n\r\n - [x] the polygon drawing is broken... so I copied code from this pr: #8425 \r\n\r\n \r\n - [x] there are still some comments which should get removed\r\n- [x] border color for rounded is still off\r\n - [x] wrong type for GDScript and Inspector (float should be color) \r\n - [x] reimplementing everything with polygons\r\n - [x] make blend and fill work with polygons\r\n - [x] shadows\r\n - [x] different border colors with polygons\r\n - [x] different border width with polygons\r\n - [x] expand margin\r\n - [x] rename: set_all_border_width -> set_border_width_all\r\n - [x] rename set_all_corner_radius -> set_corner_radius_all\r\n - [x] rename set_all_border_color -> set_border_color_all\r\n- [x] decide to only allow half_height corner radius and border or improove the limit calculation (also take the corner radius + the border into account) (needs to be done I NEED FEEDBACK WHAT BEHAVIOUR IS WANTED)\r\n- [x] antiAliasing\r\n- [x] anti_aliasing sizing (*grow(-1)*) (@n-pigeon)\r\n- [x] corner_segments as a property ( @n-pigeon )\r\n- [x] corner bug which only shows 100 * (corner_detail - 1) / corner_detail\r\n- [x] infill not fully drawn (missing last try)\r\n- [x] additional border is not supported anymore. need to use expand margin + border width. Change that in the default theme! \r\n- [x] **individual corner and border color** `CANCELD FOR FIRST VERSION`\r\n- [x] color gradient (**needed?**) `CANCELD FOR FIRST VERSION`\r\n- [x] added documentation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8899/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8898","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8898/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8898/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8898/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8898","id":231142241,"number":8898,"title":"Change
