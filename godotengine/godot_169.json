tried godot to verify some 3d transformations and found out that they were 'incorrect'.\nit seems like godot uses XYZ order for rot. matrix multiplication but the correct order is ZYX (like in blender, and glm's quaternions)\n\nim not an expert in 3d math but i read articles in internet that the correct order for euler angles is ZYX (like in quaternions) but many apps use XYZ (incorrect)\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n1. create an entity in blender, translate by 2,3,4 then rotate by 45,45,45 deg \n   compare the position with godot, try switch rotation order in blender (XYZ, YXZ - will give different position)\n2. use this code with glm\n\n```\n\n#include <iostream>\n#include <glm/vec3.hpp> // glm::vec3\n#include <glm/vec4.hpp> // glm::vec4\n#include <glm/mat4x4.hpp> //

1.0)); /// change values here to have \"XYZ\" order (wrong)\n    rm = rotate(rm, radians(45.0f), vec3(0.0, 1.0, 0.0));\n    rm = rotate(rm, radians(45.0f), vec3(1.0, 0.0, 0.0));\n    //mat4 tm = mat4();\n    mat4 tm = translate(vec3(2., 3., 4.));\n    mat4 sm = mat4();\n\n    mat4 modelMatrix = tm * rm * sm;\n        mat4 m = modelMatrix;\n\n    cout << \"model matrix:\" << endl;\n    cout << to_string(m) << endl << endl;\n\n\n\n        // Verifing it with quaternion rotation\n\n    // quaternion rm test\n\n    vec3 EulerAngles = radians(vec3(45, 45, 45)); // radians\n    quat q1 = quat(EulerAngles);\n\n    rm = mat4();\n    rm = toMat4(q1); // quat to Rm\n    m = tm * rm * sm;\n\n    cout << \"model matrix from quat:\" << endl;\n    cout << to_string(m) << endl << endl;\n\n

try to find it with `get_tree().get_root().find_node(\"node_name\")`.\n\nA lot of times that doesn't work because the target node is instanced (not owned) and the default value of `owned` if **true**. What's the rationale behind that? Wouldn't a more universal solution be to default it to **false**?\n\nIt often takes me some minutes to figure out what's happening. What's more, if a node which is formerly there as itself is later saved as its own scene and instanced, it suddenly becomes non-findable without editing the code.\n\nDoesn't Godot 3.0 constitute a

system or device - Godot version:**\nWindows 10 x64\nGodot 2.1 x64 stable\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\n Inherited scenes based on a imported model/scene with the root node set to Rigid Body on import, will not receive collision.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nImport a scene/character model and choose the custom import type set to a Rigid Body type as the root node. then create an Inherited scene based on the imported model/scene. Rig the Inherited scene with colliders and proceed to test collision.\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\nI found that a work around is to first rig the base scene with colliders then save the scene. then you can delete the colliders from the base scene which magically makes the inherited scene know what a collider is. I've tested using Rigid Body node but I assume this bug probably extends to other Physics bodies too.\nSomething else I found weird was that if you instance the base scene and the inherited scene into another scene. if both the base scene and Inherited has a collider then you remove the collider from the base scene but keep the collider on the inherited scene. the base scene looks as if it inherits the collider from the inherited scene. fun stuff once you see how these bugs are so broken.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6808/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6807","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6807/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6807/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6807/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/6807","id":182670229,"number":6807,"title":"Add

edit:_ **TL;DR:** UndoRedo should work per-scene, having it undo stuff in all open scenes is very counter-intuitive and provides a bad UX.\n\n---\n\nWhile under the effect of issue #6772 and pressing the undo shortcut more than I should, I noticed opening another scene tab is somehow an event that counts towards undo. While this could be subjected to discussion, it seems like a wrong thing to do, as one expects the undo buffer to be contextual to the currently selected scene. Not to mention spurious events can push potentially important changes from the undo stack.\n\nAs further testing, I made a number of changes in separate scenes, mashing undo proceeded to do the entire sequence in reverse instead of undoing the changes in the scene I had selected, including changing scenes. Making some memory of things, it explains some unexpected effects I've encountered during longer work sessions but I didn't quite think of it at the time.\n\nWhy this can be problematic:\nSay I have a scene \"1\" that is something like a visual effect, like a explosion.\n1) I make two changes to \"1\" and seem satisfied with the result.\n2) I open a scene \"2\" and include \"1\" in it. (at least 1-2 changes)\n3) I make a last-minute change to \"1\"\n4) I run the project, but I don't like how \"1\" looks like in action. So I decide to undo changes.\n5) I undo twice, suddenly I am back to \"2\"\n6) I keep undoing, and all changes to \"2\" are undone before I can reach \"1\" again.\n7) I have undone the changes in \"1\", but as a result I erased all changes in \"2\".\n\nThis presents a large number of small-to-grave issues during the workflow:\n1) It requires to mentally keep track of what scenes have been undone, and fix all \"unwanted\" undos (and with changes the \"redo\" buffer becomes nullified)\n2) In case the changes become too difficult to undo, it requires a copy to restore or a version control (as in git) commit to revert to. While it's good practice to have such things, it's not always readily available, specially if it's a big change or a thing requiring several small tweaks, or some change done by pure chance (it happens). Note that for changes to be shown in the main project files have to be saved, so a basic reverting stops becoming an option every time the project is run. (read: not every scene does what one wants individually)\n3) Having to restore the changes requires interrupting your workflow to restore the file.\n4) If the file was created recently and there's no backup or recent commit, well, it might be impossible to restore to a \"proper\" point and has to be remade from scratch.\n\nWhile one can argue that such potential mistakes can be avoided by being super careful, accidents/oversights/distractions happen. We are human after all. And projects can grow pretty large with a lot of files being juggled and changed all at once, or having to step away from the computer and forgetting you made change X in file Y.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6797/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6796","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6796/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6796/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6796/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/6796","id":182378214,"number":6796,"title":"Possibility
