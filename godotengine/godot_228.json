An example of this from editor_node.cpp:\n\n```\n`p->add_shortcut(ED_SHORTCUT(\"editor/save_scene_as\",TTR(\"Save Scene As..\"),KEY_MASK_SHIFT+KEY_MASK_CMD+KEY_S),FILE_SAVE_AS_SCENE);\n```\n\n`\n\nMany times, the menus, buttons, etc. are created on the fly, so call this function again on a constructor or at some place where initialization occurs, this way it can always appear in editor settings dialog. Just call it and ignore the return, as it will be cached for next time you call it.\n`\nED_SHORTCUT(\"editor/save_scene_as\",TTR(\"Save Scene As..\"),KEY_MASK_SHIFT+KEY_MASK_CMD+KEY_S)\n`\nOptionally and for simplicity you can simply get the shortcut, but it must have defined as above!\n\n```\nRef<ShortCut> ED_GET_SHORTCUT(const String& p_path);\n\nusded like:\n\nsomebutton->set_shortcut( ED_GET_SHORTCUT(\"editor/save_scene_as\") );\n```\n\nIn many places, checking for a shortcut is done manually from an unhandled input callback. Generally this is done with a switch(), so it will have to be changed to a sequence of ifs(). In such cases simply define the shortcut as in the code (two samples above ^), then check manually against an InputEvent: \n\n```\nif ( ED_IS_SHORTCUT(\"editor/save_scene_as\") ) {\n...\n}\n```\n\nI think this is all! Good luck :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5040/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":4,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5039","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5039/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5039/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5039/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5039","id":158528706,"number":5039,"title":"Add

PR simply adds a couple of methods to aid in doing in some things with screen capturing which wasn't previously possible which are fairly self-contained. The first is a renderer method for disabling buffer swapping. By turning this off, the game can retain what it last rendered while still rendering something else internally. With this, you could make it so the properties of the screenshot change without it being visible to the player. In my specific case, I use it for an ingame camera phone which has an overlay which gets removed during the screenshot phase. Once the screenshot has been successfully processed, you can then turn swap buffering back on.\n\nThe other method relates to the feeling that in the demo project, where the script simply waits two frames before getting the screen capture. Since capturing screenshots is multi-threaded, this method is not 'truly' deterministic, since although it's unlikely, it's theoretically possible that a screenshot could take longer to process. As such, I've added a simple method to check whether any screenshots are still pending, and the idea is you would continually loop and check if the screenshot has finished processing, at which point you can do something with it. You may also prefer to pause the tree, which would allow a more controlled way of handling screenshots while still being able to take advantage of multi-threading to avoid the problem of the application stalling.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5034/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5033","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5033/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5033/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5033/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5033","id":158503780,"number":5033,"title":"A proper mean to get the list of InputMap actions","user":{"login":"SuperUserNameMan","id":9801802,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/9801802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan","html_url":"https://github.com/SuperUserNameMan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279537176,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/hacktoberfest","name":"hacktoberfest","color":"00eeee","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2016-06-04T13:00:23Z","updated_at":"2016-06-04T19:37:58Z","closed_at":"2016-06-04T19:37:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Operating system or device -

Is there a way to have it return multiple indexes that share the same value?\n\nNot sure if was intentional or not just mainly curious about the behavior.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n\n```\nvar test_arr = [\"test0\",\"test1\",\"test2\",\"test2\"]\nfor i in range(test_arr.size()):\n    print(\"1st loop\")\n    print(test_arr[i])\n    for j in range(test_arr.size()):\n        print(\"2nd loop\")\n        print(test_arr[j])\n        print(test_arr.find(\"test2\"))\n```\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5020/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5019","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5019/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5019/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5019/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5019","id":158405540,"number":5019,"title":"Editor plugin crashes when removed the \"tool\" keyword","user":{"login":"vnen","id":5599796,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5599796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen","html_url":"https://github.com/vnen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":307135532,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:plugin","name":"topic:plugin","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-06-03T16:29:55Z","updated_at":"2016-06-11T23:52:25Z","closed_at":"2016-06-11T23:52:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Removing the `tool` keyword from a plugin script crashes the editor.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n- Create a new project.\n- Create a folder called `addons` inside the project.\n- Add a custom plugin to the `addons` folder.

So it's hard to tell to which method this description is about. A color would go miles in this way, so if method names were e.g. yellow, it'd be much more visible (check the bottom of the previous image, which shows a link to a function in yellow).\n- Sometimes the text gets too close of the right border. There should be a right margin and also a greater left margin. ![godot windows opt tools 64_2016-06-03_13-02-56](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5599796/15785333/2557c9a2-298d-11e6-9b09-23e93642c597.png)\n- New lines in `classes.xml` should not make paragraphs.
