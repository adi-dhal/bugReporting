It looks like in an inherited scene, Godot tries to connect the signals twice.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n1. Create a new scene, add at least one node and a script. \n2. In the \"signals\" tab, connect any node signal to a script function.\n3. Save the scene and create a new scene that inherits from it.\n4. Run the original scene -> no error.\n5. Run the inherited scene -> \"signal already connected\" error.\n\n**Link to minimal example project**:\n[signal_inherited_scene.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/411619/signal_inherited_scene.zip)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6106/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6105","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6105/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6105/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6105/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6105","id":170454457,"number":6105,"title":"Logical folders in Project List","user":{"login":"MrMaidx","id":8977194,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8977194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaidx","html_url":"https://github.com/MrMaidx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaidx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaidx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaidx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaidx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaidx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaidx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaidx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaidx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrMaidx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":390419563,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/pr%20welcome","name":"pr welcome","color":"d93f0b","default":false},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":283518733,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"007700","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":17,"created_at":"2016-08-10T16:01:13Z","updated_at":"2017-06-03T16:24:50Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hello guys,\nin a past weeks I collected a lot of demos and example projects for Godot and I have them all loaded to Project List.
