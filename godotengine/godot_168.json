16.04, Godot (git clone)\n\nHi, as the title I seems docs are missing when comes to collision Layer and Mask\nbut as for as I can understand the mask scans for collision in layer something like \n\nOBJ1Mask == OBJ2Layer\n\nso, this is my current condition\n\nconst BULLET_COLLISION_LAYER = 5\nconst FIGHTER_COLLISION_LAYER = 6\nconst ENEMY_COLLISION_LAYER  = 7\n\nconst BULLET_COLLISION_MASK  = ENEMY_COLLISION_LAYER\nconst FIGHTER_COLLISION_MASK  = ENEMY_COLLISION_LAYER\nconst ENEMY_COLLISION_MASK = FIGHTER_COLLISION_LAYER\n\nhmmm, now as per the condition Bullet should not collide with the FIGHTER, But it does\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6841/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6840","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6840/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6840/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6840/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6840","id":183252545,"number":6840,"title":"'static

address most of #6157.\n\nWhile working on this, I got a bit more scons experience and could isolate most modules (and some of the remaining drivers) in their own environment, which means that their necessary defines and include paths can now be passed without polluting the global env. It means we could drop some dirty hacks we put in several thirdparty sources to hardcode include paths so that they match our repo, etc. There is also no more risk of confusion between headers of different projects that share the same name.\n\nMost libraries that are typically available on a Linux distribution can be unbundled (i.e. you can just delete their `thirdparty/$libname` folder and build with `libname=system`). Some more work will be needed to put some order in the scons options as it's a bit messy now, but I'll do all this in a later PR. Currently only `platform/x11` has instructions to link against system libraries when `system` options are chosen, but it could be extended for other relevant platforms.\n\nTo disable a module, the syntax is now automatic: `module_$module_enable=yes|no` (see `scons --help`). We might have to document this a bit better in the official compilation docs, and also rename the current arguments I used to specify the use of builtin or system libraries for more clarity (e.g. `openssl=system` could become `system_openssl=yes` or `builtin_openssl=no`.\n\nAll in all, this was quite a lot of work and I might have made a few mistakes along the road. Therefore I'd appreciate:\n- extensive testing on all supported platforms and whenever possible also with some exotic options (e.g. disabling an important module and check that the rest of the engine still builds and runs ok).\n- code review especially of the various SCsub files.\n\nThat should be a first step towards making it **much** easier to maintain our thirdparty code, and also to get Godot packaged in Linux distributions.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6830/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":3,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6829","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6829/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6829/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6829/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/6829","id":183116310,"number":6829,"title":"Fix

the current input action system, if you press a `modifier + key` and there is no action registered for that combination no action gets pressed.\nEven if there was one which had that `key` without modifier.\n\nE.g.:\n\n```\nActionMap\n\nforward = W\nleft = A\nright = D\nshoot = Shift\n```\n\nIf at some point I'm holding `Shift` to shoot, I cannot move (because the input event won't be `W` but `Shift+W`). This forces the dev to declare ActionMap this way:\n\n```\nforward = W, Shift+W\nleft = A, Shift+A\nright = D, Shift+D\nshoot = Shift\n```\n\nWhich is annoying and hard to maintain if you have a good number of controls and are using one or two modifiers.\n\nMy proposal is to handle modifier this way:\n- Check if `Modifier+Key` is an action:\n  - If yes, press that action\n  - Else, check if there is an action which is just `Key`\n    - If yes, press that action\n\nI can start working on a PR if there is interest in this.\nAny

Standard stuff. For that, I use a Label so that I can add shadows, custom colors, etc… However, there are pieces of dialogue that would have a greater impact on the player if we could add italic and bold font styles in some words, so I consider switching to RichTextLabel.\r\n\r\nThat's the thing: I have to juggle between one another just to find out which one of them would suit me best. That's a problem.\r\n\r\nSo, I have a few suggestions.\r\n\r\nThese are about **Label**:\r\n- \"Shadow as outline\" has an integer slider setting that does _nothing_ but add or remove the outline (that's because [the code in Label grabs a boolean instead of an integer](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/scene/gui/label.cpp#L88)). An improvement to this would be to use an integer and have a thickness level of the outline\r\n- Export `visible_characters` since we only have `percent_visible` in the editor.\r\n\r\nHere are other suggestions; these are optional but highly appreciated: having shared features so that when switching from one another, there would be less broken code. Features like:\r\n- `add_text()` for Label\r\n- `set_scroll_active()`for Label\r\n- `set_text()` for RichTextLabel. Either swap `set_bbcode()`'s name or have a method that just adds raw text without checking if BBCode is on.\r\n- `percent_visible` attributes for RichTextLabel\r\n\r\nI hope this isn't asking for too much.
