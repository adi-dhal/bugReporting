After working for quite some time with it following issues appeared for me.\n1. It would be nice to move the timeline cursor beyond the animation lenght. Preferable would be a toggle button which can release the cursor or keep it within the limits. Sometimes it is nice to duplicate keyframes beyond the timeline.\n   2.Imho it would be good if we just see the node name with pos,loc,rot and not the complete path to the node. Often you cannot see which keys you are editing, because the path is so long. If then pressing on the name you could edit the whole path.\n2. There is the clear pose operator. But it is useless for a character because the default pos is at 0,0 scale is at 1,1 and rot at 0. Would be nice if we can define an anim as default pose which this function will use as reference for clearing the pose.\n3. I wish we can hide Bone Armatures. Maybe add is as a function into the skeleton menu.\n4. Coloring Bones would be awesome too.\n5. adding IK with reference bones would be great! So we can for example move the upper body and the feet will always stay at its place\n6. constraint bone width to viewport zoom. Currently the width is absolute, which can result in very fat bones when zooming out, so you the character is hardly to see.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2339","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2339/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2339/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2339/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2339","id":99279215,"number":2339,"title":"Add
