there,\n\nTwo things that I've reported on IRC already but I guess an issue is better to keep track of them and make sure they are not forgotten:\n- On the main page ( http://www.godotengine.org/wp/ ), clicking \"Recent News\" at the top of the left column brings to a 404 page. The link should point to wp/blog instead of wp/news.\n- On the download page ( http://www.godotengine.org/wp/download/ ), after the \"Latest Release\" section, there is a \"Development Release\" section that points to 1.0devel. It should probably be moved to the bottom of the column, since most people who are not looking for the latest release might look for 1.0stable and not 1.0devel.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1818","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1818/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1818/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1818/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/1818","id":73267651,"number":1818,"title":"Really
