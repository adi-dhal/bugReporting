reason for this request is that sometimes when exporting, you may end up seeing new .tex files created everywhere. The result of this is a much higher file size for the full project and a lot of duplication. I know for some cases, you may want to just have the material created with the surface itself, but considering that I always use the override material, the surface material just gets in the way and works to clutter my project file system.\n\nThe solution for that (and any other case where you want to do a complete deletion of an asset quickly and without breaking everything), would be an option to auto-delete all references to the asset in question when you get the warning prompt that comes with the _delete_ option.\n\nFor instance, in deleting an excess .tex file for instance, it would delete the references to it within all materials that use it while not deleting the materials themselves (so a diffuse texture slot for example would be reset to _null_). The project will still work when playing it and opening scene files, but the extra textures and any other old cruft can then just be cleaned out quickly and easily (with no visible impact in this case at least since said materials were overridden anyway and those materials use .tex files in a folder specifically created for them).\n\nComments?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4474/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4473","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4473/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4473/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4473/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4473","id":151773087,"number":4473,"title":"Fixed

and I had to rewrite the old code which previously worked fine using a single string, and create a whole monster which added all a bunch of blocks in which it was necessary to rewrite each directory selected call options to create the directory manually, and this shit for automation ...\nin 2.0.1 stable\n\n```\nfunc seve_file():\n    var dir = Directory.new()\n

But there is an obvious problem.\n\nTo fly this ship you would have to treat it as a RigidBody, and there is no option like that. There is an option \"Use Kinematic\", but it's really confusing. Can I move() the TileMap ? How can I detect collisions with it?\n\nThe workaround right now would be to contain the TileMap in a RigidBody and for each cell create a collision shape suitable for a tile in that cell. The fact that it's doable this way, and not via a \"TileMap\" option is not a good thing in my opinion.\n\nThe whole idea of collisions within TileMaps seems a little flawed to me. My proposition:\n1. Change \"Use Kinematic\" to \"Use Static Body\" selected by default\n2. TileSets can contain collision shapes, but don't have to contain Static Body anymore\n3. If the user deselects Use Static Body the TileMap will now have to be a child of a PhysicsBody2D (Rigid,Kinematic or Static) which will use the collision shapes\n\nSince the tilemap can be very big I can understand why this was never a feature in the first place, but since an aformentioned workaround is possible... This would also make TileSet creation a little less of a pain (no need to use static bodies).\nWhat do you think? Is this feature a good idea? Would it be hard to implement?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4453","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4453/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4453/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4453/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4453","id":151235927,"number":4453,"title":"classes.xml

if there are other objects behind object we want to select.\nIt then selects that \"behind object\" and because current nature of this tool automatically transforms it to the movement of the mouse, so there is no way to use bounding box selection in most scenes.\n\nI would suggest to separate selection from multi transform tool and make it more like ON/OFF mode for transform gizmos. It would also help if user wants, for example, only translate objects that he selects, or only select object without seeing any transform widgets on the screen that can stand in the way sometimes.\nI can elaborate that idea (visual help what I have in mind?) if that's not enough.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4447","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4447/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4447/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4447/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4447","id":150994148,"number":4447,"title":"Lock object for 3D","user":{"login":"n-pigeon","id":6152134,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6152134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-pigeon","html_url":"https://github.com/n-pigeon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-pigeon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-pigeon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-pigeon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-pigeon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-pigeon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-pigeon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-pigeon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-pigeon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n-pigeon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":283518733,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"007700","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-04-25T22:08:20Z","updated_at":"2017-09-19T12:55:38Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nIn 2D there is an option to Lock objects from selection, something like that would be useful for 3D as well.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4447/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4746","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"E0C9:572C:151C4C5:29EB3E3:59D69D9D","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=248>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=246>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"f98d42bd982a9e3d828bee0bb43fc9b3\"","status":"200 OK"}}
