thus the\nnon-ASCII characters are lost.\n\nThis fix converts the `argv` elements to UTF-8 using `String::utf8`\nbefore inserting them in the `Vector`.\n\nTested in Archlinux x86_64.\n\nPlease test this change in Windows with a non-UTF-8 encoding (e.g. ISO-8859-15), it may break Windows-only behavior because the `execute` method in `class OS_Windows` doesn't convert the arguments to UTF-8.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/117","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/117/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/117/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/117/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/117","id":27795927,"number":117,"title":"change

Create a project with a path that contains any non-ascii character (e.g. é).\n2. Close the project manager.\n3. Open the file editor_settings.xml, there will be a new `<string name=\"projects/\">` with the newly created project; notice that there is no corruption now.\n4. Open the project manager, then close it again.\n5. Open the file editor_settings.xml again, the project's entry now will contain some garbage.\n6. Open and close again the project manager.\n7. Open the file again, now there will be (more or less) double the garbage.\n\nRepeating step 6 will double the garbage in the config file.\nAs a side note, after 20 repetitions my editor_settings.xml file grow past 2MiB.\nAlso note that the project doesn't need to be opened at all to trigger the bug, just to exist in the project list.\n\nTested on Archlinux x86_64, build from

string.\nlocalize_path then is replacing backslashes with slashes and calls\nafterwards `String::simplify_path`\n\nString::simplify_path is checking wheter a string starts with:\n- res://\n- local://\n- user://\n\nIf any of those is true it removes this section.\n\nHowever, if any of the first letters of those are matching begins_with\nreturns true, which is wrong. It should only return true if the whole\nstring is matched at the beginning.\n\nThis caused the whole desaster and lead localize_path into an endless loop\nbecause out of `u` suddenly became user:// which it then tried again to\nlocalize and so on.\n\nThis fix, fixes the root of the problem which is begins_with which should\nnot return true if not the whole search string was matched.\n\nSigned-off-by: Vinzenz Feenstra evilissimo@gmail.com\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/109","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/109/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/109/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/109/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/109","id":27744911,"number":109,"title":"tools/editor/project_export: tree_vb already has a parent","user":{"login":"vinzenz","id":36638,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/36638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinzenz","html_url":"https://github.com/vinzenz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinzenz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinzenz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinzenz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinzenz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinzenz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinzenz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinzenz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinzenz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinzenz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-02-17T19:51:06Z","updated_at":"2014-07-04T21:34:33Z","closed_at":"2014-02-21T01:54:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/109","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/109","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/109.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/109.patch"},"body":"This error was printed on the console on every start of the editor.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/109/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/108","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/108/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/108/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/108/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/108","id":27744889,"number":108,"title":"Application crashes when creating script with path beginning with 'u' or 'l'","user":{"login":"AlphaSheep","id":6051586,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6051586?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlphaSheep","html_url":"https://github.com/AlphaSheep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlphaSheep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlphaSheep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlphaSheep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlphaSheep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlphaSheep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlphaSheep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlphaSheep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlphaSheep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlphaSheep/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-02-17T19:50:43Z","updated_at":"2014-02-21T07:30:02Z","closed_at":"2014-02-21T07:30:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The application crashes when entering a path beginning with 'u' or 'l' in the create script dialog.
