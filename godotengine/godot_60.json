while using Godot I've experienced a few annoyances with the import system, notably bloat in the repository due to automatically imported files. For example, I have a folder with documents for my game, and included are images. These images would never be included in the game, but instead in the documentation, and yet Godot automatically imports the images. What I suggest is allowing for a .gitignore-like system, where users can define a pattern, directory, or file they want Godot to overlook.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10075/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10074","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10074/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10074/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10074/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/10074","id":247905316,"number":10074,"title":"Removing a rigidbody and re-adding it to the scene results in errors and the rigidbody disappearing","user":{"login":"cart","id":2694663,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2694663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart","html_url":"https://github.com/cart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279128044,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/confirmed","name":"confirmed","color":"66dd66","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":370471880,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:physics","name":"topic:physics","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":13,"created_at":"2017-08-04T05:20:39Z","updated_at":"2017-08-16T01:24:26Z","closed_at":"2017-08-16T00:22:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\r\nArch Linux - 211dfa6602cff8605acfd29986dcf33f3c3176cc\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nWhenever I remove a RigidBody (with mode == RigidBody.MODE_RIGID) from a scene, then re-add it to the scene, I get the following errors (spammed repeatedly):\r\n\r\n```\r\nCondition 'p_axis.is_normalized() == false' is true\r\nCondition 'determinant() == 0' is true\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe rigidbody also disappears.\r\n\r\nThe errors are there for transform validation and I agree that they should be there, but I would expect a rigidbody removed from the tree with a valid transform to re-enter the tree with a valid transform.

IMO, it would be healthy for Godot to use standards-compliant TOML to allow for easier automation and external reach. I think these are the things still left after you take out readability (both have it) and semantics (also irrelevant).\r\n\r\nAlso, another thought I had: perhaps schemas could have their extensions prepended to the `.toml` file extension, a la `.tar.gz` or `.pkg.tar.xz` or similar. This would mean the scene schema would become `.scn.toml` rather than `.tscn` (short for \"text scene\", right?), and `.scn` alone would still unambiguously mean the binary format in use.\r\n\r\nI know Godot already supports XML, but as KidsCanCode pointed out earlier on the Discord server it's not exactly VCS-friendly (nor as easy to read)... but right now it seems to be the only option for a \"standard\" format for project metadata. Moving to standard TOML therefore kills two birds with one stone, making XML less relevant.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10068","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10068/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10068/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10068/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10068","id":247789197,"number":10068,"title":"Fix

the moment there is no way for a GDNative library to do something during frame idle time. To temporarily solve that in [godot-nim](https://pragmagic.github.io/godot-nim/master/index.html) I implemented [NimRuntime](https://github.com/pragmagic/godot-nim/blob/master/godot/nimruntime.nim) class, which is supposed to be added as an AutoLoad singleton. But this approach has drawbacks:\r\n\r\n1. It adds burden on the user of adding the class to the project.\r\n2. It doesn't work in the editor. I could also add `NimEditorRuntime` plugin, but this again has issue (1) of burdening end user.\r\n\r\nSo the library itself becomes not self-contained, since you can't just add it to the project and expect it to work.\r\nA simple solution is to forward frame() call to the library where necessary actions could be performed. It's called during idle time, so it is perfectly fit for this use case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10060/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4933","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"B135:6E60:E8E33C:23B6896:59D69A92","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=61>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=59>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"a1281d7a23f7b3e7e276f7e4f7d4b60a\"","status":"200 OK"}}
