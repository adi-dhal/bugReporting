However, I was using custom user interface inputs for a local multiplayer Idea.\n\nAlso, and additional note which strange enough is that the keyboard still works normally rather than the gamepad support, both the Steam Controller and the Xinput controllers does not work at all... Plus the controls, minus the steam controller works fine outside Big Picture Mode...\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nMake custom user input mapping that uses the joystick on the gamepad, Export your game to EXE or whatever works, open up Steam and bring in your game as a shortcut using \"Add Non-Steam Game to library, Open up Big Picture Mode, go to where you've installed the game and see if you can get the joystick to work...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4566/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4565","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4565/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4565/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4565/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4565","id":153333109,"number":4565,"title":"ImageTexture flag \"Repeat\" has no effect if \"Mipmaps\" is disabled.","user":{"login":"RayKoopa","id":9631152,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/9631152?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa","html_url":"https://github.com/RayKoopa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-05-05T21:43:56Z","updated_at":"2016-06-18T22:33:51Z","closed_at":"2016-06-18T22:25:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Operating system or device:**\nWindows 10 Pro x64\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nChoosing only the flag `Repeat` does not make an ImageTexture repeat.
