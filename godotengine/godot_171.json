between and trying to find an available number from one.\n\nThis PR makes every operation follow the same rules (separator-aware, counting from the number of the operated node) and also renames and moves the setting to become now per-project because:\n- it's the easiest way of making every operation aware of the separator setting without adding a lot of conditional code for editor/non-editor situations and to make live editing already aware without making it more complex;\n- name-number seprator pertains to the naming style chosen for a specific project.\n\nFurthermore, some duplicated

am not exactly sure if this is the right place to ask this question but let's ask:\n\nSomeone on this topic:\nhttps://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/1635\nSaid this:\n\n\"I'm not a lawyer either but here's the thing.. MIT license states \"The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\" and because there is no definition of \"software\" it can be misinterpreted. Software can be defined as a set of machine instructions (which is binary file) meaning you're legally obligated to put a MIT copyright somewhere in the executable file. So mentioning of godot is not required, but copyright notice must be included somehow (not necessarily has to be rendered to the screen). But to play it safe - just include it in the credits and be done with it.\"\n\nIs this true if it isn't true why isn't it true can you explain about it?\n\nAnd also in Godotengine.org it says:\n\"Godot is completely free and open source under the very permissive MIT license. No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. Your game is yours, down to the last line of engine code.\"\n\nI think if that thing is true this thing in Godotengine.org isn't true because I think that thing in Godotengine.org also means you are not forced to put anything in/with your game but if that thing is true I think it means you are forced to put something in/with your game.\n\nI also asked this question in the Q/A of godotengine.org too.\n\nThank you.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6745/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6744","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6744/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6744/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6744/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6744","id":181829979,"number":6744,"title":"Comments

I wont go into much detail about my game other than say it covers a very large area.\n\nThat said - I need the ability to shift the world origin on the X, Y and Z axis as needed.  Currently as it stands Unreal Engine 4 is the only engine that can do this out of the box. This feature would also need to work with the new High level networking API. \n\nWould it be possible to implement this feature?
