I find it hard to formulate their thoughts in English. If something (in the text below) is unclear or questionable, please give a leading question. I will try to describe more.\n\nI started developing the game \"first person\" and faced a problem. Godot does not support international keyboard control. That is, the control works only when the English keyboard layout. Or I did not find the opportunity to make the control does not depend on the keyboard layout.\n\nIn the window \"Projekt Settings\", tab \"Input Map\" - it is not possible to add non-Latin characters. But even if such a possibility was - it did not solve the problem. Languages very much and can't foresee everything.\n\nFor a moment hope gave:\nclass_input\n  bool is_key_pressed ( int scancode )\n\n(Table scancode: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/wiki/class_@global-scope)\n\nBut it is not the keyboard codes are, the codes of entered characters. As a result, all the same error, switching the keyboard layout leads to a complete breakdown of control in the game to Godot.\n\nThis is a very serious error for develop international games. The necessary mechanism for scanning the keyboard (key codes), not that it introduces characters.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2915/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2914","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2914/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2914/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2914/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2914","id":118915991,"number":2914,"title":"2D mesh-based sprite deformation","user":{"login":"StraToN","id":1289207,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1289207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StraToN","html_url":"https://github.com/StraToN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StraToN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StraToN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StraToN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StraToN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StraToN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StraToN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StraToN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StraToN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StraToN/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/7","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/7","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/7/labels","id":2529217,"number":7,"title":"3.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":114,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2017-05-18T13:33:56Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T12:23:57Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":35,"created_at":"2015-11-25T20:17:41Z","updated_at":"2017-09-08T16:14:39Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This would certainly be a lovely feature to add in Godot ;)\nAnd maybe not THAT difficult...
