3.0 master\r\n\r\nMinor in general,  noticed a few characters look a bit odd with the new Hack font / icons:\r\n\r\n- My main concern is indentation marks look out of place. I liked to code with them as they were fine, discrete enough and improved readability for me and made indents visible (they matter :p), but now I find them too noticeable (alternating shape, size and different thickness). I preferred the old ones, is it coming from the font though?\r\n- Minor: already noted earlier, but the zeroes look weird. I understand it's to differentiate with O and I like this, but filling the whole oval isn't common.\r\n- Minor: more personal note, but I got used to wider angled brackets. Hack ones are more tight compared to Consolas, for example.\r\n\r\nNew:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1311555/30766491-caeec610-9ff5-11e7-926b-5ed01bed2a8f.png)\r\nOld:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1311555/30766678-07ed8b22-9ff7-11e7-834b-b32662f4a5ea.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n(other than that the font looks fine so far)\r\n\r\nEdit: Github shows no images anywhere on my end, I hope you can see them...?\r\n\r\nEdit 2: At the moment I'll most likely try another font myself and stick with it.

seems a good idea to move third party libraries to another repo and prepare them as prebuild to download for all supported platforms like what Cocos2d-x project done. They have two repo, one for engine and one for dependencies. Before engine compilation, dependencies downloaded by a python script:\r\nEngine repo: https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x\r\nDependencies repo: https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x-3rd-party-libs-src\r\n\r\nAdvantages:\r\nFaster engine compilation(Only linking to prebuild libraries)\r\nLess fear and stress for core developers to add big libraries like ICU and Harfbuzz. :)\r\nSimpler source management to update libraries?!\r\n@reduz @akien-mga

out some code that I introduced that I think is the source of trouble for #11450 \r\n\r\nI haven't removed it at this point because I think we should discuss this further, so tagging @Calinou , @akien-mga and @reduz  :)\r\n\r\nRight now the OSX build makes the resource folder in the app bundle the current working folder so that if there is a datapack file in that folder, it will get loaded. That all works fine now.\r\n\r\nI originally got thrown off by the get_resource_dir method as it made sense to have this return the resources path and it would open up the datapack from there. I only found out later there was a comment in the project loading code that this had become defunct and indeed, it only attempts to load a project.godot file from this location if specified. I left the code so we could have a discussion whether we want to change how this works.\r\n\r\nWhat I didn't realise is that returning this value would cause the rest of the loading code to be skipped regardless of whether a project file was found. The result of this is that a tools build put inside of an app bundle won't load any projects!! (hence 11450)\r\nOnly when run directly things work as they should.\r\n\r\nFor now I've commented out the code so our tools build works again. Hope to catch you guys on IRC so we can decide whether to remove this all together or whether we do want to implement get_resource_dir the way I suggest and either make an exception for the tools build or remove the code that stops further loading if a project file can't be loaded from this location.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11482/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11481","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11481/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11481/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11481/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/11481","id":259674486,"number":11481,"title":"Add

2.1.3 (and 2.1.4)\r\n\r\nI'm trying to draw a sprite A on top of another sprite B, where the latter is not transparent.

However, once a clone of A (A1) is added, it does not get rendered at all - indicating that the texscreen() read texture is empty. \r\n\r\nThe node layout:\r\n![c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13801432/30713243-a15df022-9f06-11e7-8f3a-13ecf7e900ca.PNG)\r\nbg here is the \"clipping\" sprite and skeles are the sprites to be drawn on top\r\n\r\nThe result:\r\n![a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13801432/30713330-df37e272-9f06-11e7-9664-e6a982f5f6e6.PNG)\r\nOne of the skele sprites is bright everywhere except the edges - behaving as desired.
