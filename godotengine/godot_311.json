posted [here](http://www.godotengine.org/topics/12130?r=12135#message-12135) help was needed with creating a XML converter to Open Project wiki markup format.\n\nSo, here is my PR.\n\nThe script works a little different than the other there, it takes more arguments. It **requires Python 3.x**. I added the option for the developer to choose a output directory, so the directory where the script is ran don't get cluttered with text files.\n\nYou can also specify the XML, by default the script will try to open the file `class_list.xml` that is assumed to be in the same directory. Here is the output of the command `--help`:\n\n```\nusage: makedocs.py [-h] [--input XMLFP] --output-dir OUTPUTDIR\n\nGenerates documentation from a XML file to different markup languages\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  --input XMLFP         Input XML file, default: /home/jorge/godot/tools/docdump/class_list.xml\n  --output-dir OUTPUTDIR\n                        Output directory for generated files\n```\n\nI'm planning to add later a couple more of output formats, like markdown and dokuwiki (if they are required), and also _internationalization_ because `class_list.xml` will be subject of translations to several languages in the future.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2548","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2548/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2548/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2548/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/2548","id":108569228,"number":2548,"title":"Initial

Also just swapping the order of foobar and test makes it work ok.   Very difficult to debug and trace these errors down but I'll try to submit other examples as I can.  I can send a zip of this test case as a project by email if desired.\n\nI'm using 1.1 Stable under windows 7 64 bit.\n\n```\n// Uncomment the following and the shader fails to compile with error:\n//
