1.0.2h in `thirdparty/openssl`).\r\n\r\n`modules/openssl/stream_peer_openssl.cpp` should be updated to build against the new API. Ideally, it should be able to build against both 1.0.x and 1.1.0, we might be able to use conditional version checks to use the proper API. Eventually, the bundled source should also be updated so that we can continue benefiting from upstream security fixes.\r\n\r\n**Workaround:**\r\nFor the time being we should probably default to using the bundled openssl code on X11 (`builtin_openssl=yes`). Most people providing unofficial binaries don't pay attention to this, and users of distros defaulting to OpenSSL 1.1.0 can't run those binaries without installing a compat package, when provided.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8624/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8623","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8623/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8623/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8623/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/8623","id":225616509,"number":8623,"title":"Not loading resources when trying to run the project from the editor.","user":{"login":"cassio-raposa","id":2287391,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2287391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cassio-raposa","html_url":"https://github.com/cassio-raposa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cassio-raposa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cassio-raposa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cassio-raposa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cassio-raposa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cassio-raposa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cassio-raposa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cassio-raposa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cassio-raposa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cassio-raposa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":410064485,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/needs%20testing","name":"needs testing","color":"ff9900","default":false},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-05-02T07:50:17Z","updated_at":"2017-05-31T18:53:03Z","closed_at":"2017-05-31T18:53:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device -

Using the \"create new material shader\" repro steps from #8314 as an example, p_code (the code text from the shader editor) starts as a string of length zero which results in an invalid p_code[0] reference in line 3756.\r\n\r\nThis now properly extracts the shader type (you can verify this by creating a new ShaderMaterial, editing it, and typing a valid shader type declaration, such as \"shader_type spatial;\"\r\n\r\nFrom what I have gathered there are actually two bugs with similar symptoms:\r\n1. This indexing problem fixed here (which results in a segmentation fault), which is current hit every time you try to type in the shader editor.\r\n2. a segmentation fault on line 2291 of rasterizer_storage_gles3.cpp when attempting to call material->shader->uniforms.front().  This is sometimes hit right after clicking \"New Shader\" in the ShaderMaterial dropdown menu, but the failure seems to be nondeterministic.  Sometimes it fails on the first click, sometimes it takes multiple tries.  I couldn't figure it out after a cursory glance.  I'm hoping someone with a little more context can help me out.  I'm new to this code :)\r\n\r\nIf you encounter an error when validating this fix, make sure you didn't hit the second bug mentioned above (because when it does occur, it happens first) ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8621","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8621/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8621/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8621/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/8621","id":225567694,"number":8621,"title":"Rendering is broken on UWP","user":{"login":"vnen","id":5599796,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5599796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen","html_url":"https://github.com/vnen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":361780559,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:uwp","name":"platform:uwp","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279098255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:porting","name":"topic:porting","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":279098111,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:rendering","name":"topic:rendering","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-05-02T01:24:18Z","updated_at":"2017-07-12T04:05:54Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Just as a note to remind that the renderer is not working on UWP.
