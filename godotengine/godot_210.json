However, Godot does not use this convention, instead using double finger for zooming. That makes the zoom very sensitive, and quite clunkier to use when compared to other systems. This also means that panning doesn't work using just the pad, and you have to use spacebar+click to pan, which is harder.

compiling Godot with GCC 5.4.0, we get tons of `[-Wunused-variable]` and `[-Wunused-but-set-variable]` warnings for this kind of things:\n\n```\ndrivers/chibi/cp_loader_s3m.cpp: In member function 'CPLoader::Error CPLoader_S3M::load_sample(CPSample*)':\ndrivers/chibi/cp_loader_s3m.cpp:147:7: warning: unused variable 'dsk' [-Wunused-variable]\n   int dsk=file->get_byte();\n       ^\ndrivers/chibi/cp_loader_s3m.cpp:148:7: warning: unused variable 'pack' [-Wunused-variable]\n   int pack=file->get_byte();\n       ^\n```\n\nIn our various loaders in `drivers/`, we quite often use `int some_var_that_will_never_be_used = file->get_byte();` just to move further while decoding the file.\n\nIt's not a big deal, but getting rid of these warnings would be nice. What would be the good practice in such a case? Just invoke `file->get_byte(); // pack` without assigning its return value?\n\nSuggestions welcome, then I can handle the fix for all occurrences (there are quite a few).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5568/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5567","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5567/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5567/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5567/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5567","id":163956923,"number":5567,"title":"AtlasTextures
