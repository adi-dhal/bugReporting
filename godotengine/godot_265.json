Why do we need it?\n\nwith the work of @reduz and alket soon we can have an asset sharing  ( addon ) but the missing system is that this addons is all in gd script but there are so many works that can be done in modules like add Admob,IAP,OpenCV,CameraCaputre,VRsupport and so many more , this modules should be compiled and it's scary for beginners just to clone the godot repo add the module then download dependencies and compile it but think about it if the modules is compiled and can be added to engine it will be great.\n# Problems\n- first of all that this modules should be compiled with compilers that the godot was compiled\n- every version of godot can load just the modules for that version\n- our last problem how can we implement it that it will be simple and easy to use both for module developers and engine users\n\nmy solution is that we just support those release on steam and in site the stable versions and if someone wants a custom version he should download the modules code and compile it themselves, for compatibility issue the modules should have a supported version and for different platform the compiled version should exist.\n\n@akien-mga I will appreciate it if you  add feature request and discussion label to this issue

abs() is not available for Vector types. But seeing how vector maths is super common in game development and abs() is just about one of the most common operations you do on vectors it's needed.\nI'll use 3D vectors as an example but it concerns 2D vectors as well.\n\nDoing it manually is tedious, long to write, poorly readable and error prone.\nA single typo in this 'sqrt(pow(TESTVEC3D.x,2) + pow(TESTVEC3D.y,2) + pow(TESTVEC3D.z,2))' and awkward things happen that are hard to debug because it's still a legal operation, just not what you wanted. \n\nThe alternative 'TESTVEC3D.distance_to(Vector3(0,0,0))' is

Godot supports accelerometers on Android (not sure about other platforms), and combined with magnetometer data it would be possible to determine a device's orientation on a planet, provided the device is not in freefall. This can be observed in the Google Sky app and various 3D compass apps.\n\nSpecific to the Android platform, there are potential issues with calibration (as in TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD vs TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD_UNCALIBRATED) so it's up to the implementer which flag would be used and how it would work. I'm sure that as time goes on Godot will acquire more uniform sensor support across platforms. Every device that comforms to each platform specification provides sensor data in the same format for that platform, so any issues with calibration and accuracy could be expected to be the same no matter what device is used.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3921/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3920","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3920/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3920/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3920/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3920","id":138565042,"number":3920,"title":"html5:
