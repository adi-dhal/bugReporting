That is not possible, because upon conversion of a Scene into a MeshLib, navmeshes for each tile are lost.\n\nI think being able to navigate gridmap mazes is a pretty important thing to have for gridmaps as long as they exist at all, so it would be very nice to be able to attach navigation data to meshlib tiles.\n\nHere's an example of an unfortunate situation where the GridMap simply stops sufficing, in the form of a modified navmesh demo.\n\n![godot_mergemesh](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3822768/13930220/c5e22cda-efa6-11e5-9625-03db8b24b52d.png)\n[navmesh-vs-gridmap.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/182903/navmesh-vs-gridmap.zip)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4115","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4115/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4115/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4115/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4115","id":142389341,"number":4115,"title":"Syntax

Since open source engines are now very much and deal with every time, no no desire.\nIn my opinion, for the promotion of Godot need beautiful demo. And the most important living projects. And the more of them the better.\nTo increase community Godot would be a good idea to create a series of articles for example on artificial intelligence. Naturally all of the examples do on Godot. For AI do not need a smart graphics and many articles about AI would be interesting. If the engine is simply to promote the start of comparison unnecessary discussion where Godot may lose such engines to both Unity3D and Unrial4.

You can still change the size of the node with the mouse, but you can't change its position. You can also still change the child nodes' positions by editing their values. This only happens if the popup node is the base node of the scene, so if it were a child of a node you could still drag its children normally.\n\nTo reproduce, create a new scene and make the base node a Popup node.

mouse.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4097","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4097/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4097/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4097/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4097","id":142068479,"number":4097,"title":"Ability
