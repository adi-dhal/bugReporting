operators (*, /)\n- spaces around comparison operators and compound assignment operators\n- space after a comment start (#)\n- removed trailing spaces or tabs, apart from those that delimit the function indentation level (those could be removed too but since they are added automatically by the editor when typing code, keeping them for now)\n- function blocks separate by two newlines\n- comment sentences start with an upper-case letter\n\nThe scene files were resaved with the (current) 2.0 format, and some scenes that were in XML format were converted to SCN, to be consistent across

bracket completion enables the editor to add a right bracket automatically after a left bracket was typed. \n\nHow to reproduce:\n- Enable auto bracket completion in Settings/Editor

Built-in or not built-in has no impact.\n- Try to type a left bracket\n\nExpected:\n- A right bracket should appear next to the left bracket.\n\nWorkaround:\n- In Settings/Editor Settings, disable TextEditor/Auto Brace Complete, then re-enable it immediately.\n- Auto bracket completion now works.\n- Every time a new script is created, this behaviour happens.\n\nBY THE WAY, this functionality should be enabled by default.
