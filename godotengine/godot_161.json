So I'm trying to use Polygon2D and CollisionPolygon2D.\r\n\r\nIt seems that there is a lack of default shape for Polygon2D, so I needed to create a circular shape through code:\r\n```\r\nextends CollisionPolygon2D\r\n\r\nconst shape = Vector2Array()\r\nvar util = load(\"util.gd\").new()\r\n\t\r\nfunc _ready():\r\n\tfor i in range(0,360,10):\r\n\t\tshape.append(util.pol2cart(deg2rad(i), 50)+get_pos())\r\n\tprint(shape)\r\n\tset_polygon(shape)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, instead of using CollisionShape/Circle, I wanted to simply import the Polygon2D into a CollisionPolygon2D (as it would be nice thing to do later for more complex shape):\r\n``` python\r\nextends CollisionPolygon2D\r\nfunc _ready():\r\n        set_build_mode(0)\r\n\tset_polygon(get_node(\"/root/main_scene/Polygon2D\").get_polygon())\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is not working very much. Note that Godot asked me to create a shape for the CollisionPolygon2D object in the Godot 2D Editor (that is the object selected in the 2D editor, in the screenshot below) ; then my script is expected to overwrite that shape. Here the results:\r\n![2016-11-05 3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10520249/20029698/88b104fe-a34b-11e6-8748-ee0baa49bbdb.png)\r\nIt does look like that the Collision polygon has been overridden by my script (you can see the red circle on the game window, drawn by the debugger), though with an offset. \r\nHowever, when I move the red square with my keyboard (that have the square collision shape, shown in grey), the red circle is not making any collision (I can pass through it). Interestingly, if I go, with my square, near the polygon shape that I defined in the 2D Editor, I can experience collision with that polygon (I cannot pass through it).\r\n\r\nThus, it seems that there may be:\r\n- a bug in the debugger,\r\n- a problem with creating polygon by code for the CollisionPolygon2D object.\r\n\r\nAfter that I try to simply copy paste the code that creates my circular polygon for my Polygon2D object into the CollisionPolygon2D object:\r\n\r\n```\r\nextends CollisionPolygon2D\r\n\r\nvar util = load(\"util.gd\").new()\r\nconst shape = Vector2Array()\r\n\r\nfunc _ready():\r\n\tfor i in range(0,360,10):\r\n\t\tshape.append(util.pol2cart(deg2rad(i), 50)+get_pos())\r\n\tprint(shape)\r\n\tset_polygon(shape)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, that does not work at all :/ when I run the game, the debugger shows no collision polygon for the object. However, if I move my red square, I can see that there is collision with the shape defined in the 2D editor.\r\n\r\nI don't know if that is a bug or if it is me who do it wrong.\r\nBut if it is a bug, it may be quite problematic for when people want to make some prototyping with simple shape.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7039","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7039/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7039/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7039/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7039","id":187486316,"number":7039,"title":"Clean/fix

What I mean is to, somehow, be able to create your own Resource type, making it possible to create data files and edit them within the editor.\r\n\r\n**How would it work?**\r\n\r\nMy sincere apologies if it's not welcome to show how other engines do it, but I think it's interesting to exemplify. I will just not mention the framework/editor I'm talking about, but that's how one can create a Resource:\r\n\r\nhttp://image.prntscr.com/image/fc4489a3b0104102974c6b08da2dd965.png\r\n\r\nAfter compiling it, it's possible to edit the public properties (similar to export vars) of said Resource. Reminder: The Resource itself won't do any thing, it just stores data for the game to handle. The Resource's file extension could be fileName.resourceName.res.\r\n\r\nLet's say I create a Resource type called Character and I name it George... Its filename would be george.character.res. There are other ways to name it, though (or maybe leaving it as field, so the user names it however they want).\r\n\r\n**When would it be useful?**\r\n\r\nThat's a great way to make databases. One could make a --xml, json, ini or whatever-- the game would read and then would just create Resources for the game. Let's say I created a Weapon Resource, and a Character one. The Weapon Resource would contain: A string called Name, and a int called Damage. \r\n\r\nThe Character Resource would contain: A string called Name, and a ResourceRef<Weapon> called Weapon. Then I could give the weapons a name and a damage. Also give the Character a name and a weapon.\r\n\r\nThen, I could create a Sprite node that would be my character, with a ResourceRef<Character> and properly load its data. Not only set its weapon but the stats, appearence, or whatever I wanted.\r\n\r\nI hope I'm clear and if there's already a feasible way to achieve this within Godot, let me know how.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7037/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7036","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7036/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7036/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7036/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7036","id":187395114,"number":7036,"title":"Fix
