system or device - Godot version:**\nOS X El Capitain, Godot from HEAD\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nIt would be cool to open the Quick Search dialog when linking to another scene (due inheritance or instancing) instead of Open File dilog. Quick Search could have something like \"New Scene\" button in this case. \n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nRight click on any node -> Instance Child Scene -> I see Open File dialog.\n\nI think I have skills to create PR with this, but I really not sure with time to implement. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5180/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5179","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5179/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5179/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5179/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5179","id":159852265,"number":5179,"title":"Enhanced Android export","user":{"login":"RandomShaper","id":11797174,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11797174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper","html_url":"https://github.com/RandomShaper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279097562,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:android","name":"platform:android","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279098255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:porting","name":"topic:porting","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":13,"created_at":"2016-06-12T22:39:56Z","updated_at":"2016-07-23T14:28:04Z","closed_at":"2016-06-13T18:06:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/5179","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5179","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5179.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5179.patch"},"body":"Improvements on the generation of the final APK:\n- Some files on the export template are decided to be kept uncompressed by the Android packaging tool (namely, `resources.asrc`), but more could be there in the future. **Android export now respects AAPT decisions on file compression.**\n- The same AAPT tool used in standard Android development keeps certain file types (certain image and media formats) from being compressed because there is little to no benefit, or more, it can be counterproductive. **Android export now avoids compressing badly compressable files.**\n- This applies as well to Godot resource files that are already compressed (i.e., scene files). **Android export now checks the header of resource files to check whether they are already compressed.**\n\nAvoiding recompression can improve exporting performance, but more than that, avoids decompression at runtime, which is much nicer.\n\nAnd finally, the exported APK is aligned to 4-byte like the standard Android packaging process does. It's an important optimization (or could also be though of as a de-pessimization). Basically it makes that at runtime uncompressed files can be memory-mapped to lower the memory footprint and improve performance. So it's sinergystic with the former points.\n\nMore details can be found at [the official announcement when they introduced `zipalign`](http://android-developers.blogspot.com.es/2009/09/zipalign-easy-optimization.html). So **now Android export zip-aligns the output APK.**\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5178","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5178/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5178/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5178/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5178","id":159839765,"number":5178,"title":"Documented

Set up a project with a scene that is within a child `Viewport` that is configured as a Render Target.\n2. Have a node within the scene that is collecting input via `get_viewport().get_mouse_pos()` from within `_process()` or whatever\n3. Watch the errors pile up\n\n**Coda**\n\nI'm doing the above thing (getting mouse_pos from a viewport that is a rendertarget) because my \"game world\" has custom lighting and I have GUI elements overlaying the game world. And you _don't_ want those lit the same as the game world, for obvious reasons.\n\nSo I'm using a render target. I _also_ have mouse-picking of map tiles in the game world. Before I switched to using a render target, this was straightforward and I could use proper event handling on my player node via `_input()`.\n\nAfter switching to using a render target, I discovered that `_input()` events aren't being triggered on that node anymore.\n\nSo in experimenting I tried seeing if a child viewport would properly track mouse coords (and it does!), but it spews errors because of what looks like an assert in the C++ src.\n\nAny insight on this would be appreciated, especially if it involves suppressing the error or a suitable workaround.\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5169/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5168","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5168/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5168/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5168/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5168","id":159801985,"number":5168,"title":"Editor

and the editor eventually crashes with this last error:\n\n```\nVBoxContainer: 272,201\nbind toptions\n..http://godotengine.org/asset-library/api\n1 url:

first of, I apologise for opening an issue on the repo that has nothing to do with the repo - it's just my issue prevents me from using the Godot Answers site.\n\n**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\nN/A\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nSo I was just about to get involved on the Godot Answers site and answer a question, so naturally I signed up - using the \"Link your GitHub account\" option.\nWhen clicking on the link in the activation email for the Godot Answers site, I'm greeted with \"Code not correct - please click below to send a new link\"\nI've tried multiple activations and 2 different emails at different domains but it always ends up the same.\n\nI've tried searching around on the Answers site and here on GitHub for this issue but couldn't find anything. \n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nCreate new account on GodotEngine.org using \"Link GitHub account\".\nClick on link in activation email.\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\nN/A\n\nThanks for the hard work guys - I've only spent a few hours learning Godot but I like what I see so far (mostly)!\n\nI'm more than happy to provide anything you guys may need.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4770","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"C4B6:572D:134172F:2ECD736:59D69D39","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=224>;
