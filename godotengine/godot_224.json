Your built-in GUI comfortable doing editor but it does not play. And that would make even a simple game to do their own controls that is tiring. It may be worth considering the creation of a small number of standard control for the casual games.

Typically it had empty FCOLLADA element and GOOGLEEARTH double_sided set to 0.\nAs I changed the default value for double sidedness to FALSE it can collide with other exporters which maybe assume that
