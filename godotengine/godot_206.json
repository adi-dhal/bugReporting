Create a control of any type (eg. a panel)\n2. Create a nested control of any type (eg. a button)\n3. Create a theme and attach it to the button\n4. Add Class Items TooltipPanel or TooltipLabel (any or both)\n5. Modify properties so that they could be easily noticed\n6. Add a tooltip text to the button\n7. Run the scene, hover over the element, the tooltip is using default styling\n\nAlso, in the element preview area for theme editing there is no tooltip element. My suggestion - add a dedicated tooltip element or attach tooltip texts to every element previewed.\n\nEDIT: I've encountered this issue with a more complex hierarchy, so perhaps my issue laid somewhere else. My tooltip refused to change unless I changed the theme for VBoxContainer, while my tooltipped buttons were contained deeper in panels (which were styled).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5704/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5703","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5703/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5703/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5703/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5703","id":165646300,"number":5703,"title":"[RichTextLabel] incorrect position in parent","user":{"login":"radubolovan","id":16237448,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/16237448?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/radubolovan","html_url":"https://github.com/radubolovan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radubolovan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radubolovan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radubolovan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radubolovan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radubolovan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radubolovan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radubolovan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radubolovan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radubolovan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-07-14T20:02:58Z","updated_at":"2016-07-15T08:29:39Z","closed_at":"2016-07-15T08:22:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:** Windows 10 - Godot 2.1-beta\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nI have a simple scene with one Node2D object as \"root\" and I resized it to full cover the 2D area of the Camera.

for 3.0 a big compatibility breakage is expected, it will be a perfect time to review the API to rename confusing stuff, create/remove singletons, and also standardizing names across the different

do different things.\r\n- `pressed`/`released` signals from `BaseButton`, which does not really do what it sounds like. They should be renamed to `button_{down,up}` (#4625, #5262).\r\n- `CheckBox` inherits `Button`, which means it has `is_pressed()` method instead of a more natural `is_checked()`.\r\n- `Input.get_mouse_speed()` returns the speed of the _last non-null_ mouse motion, not the current one. It could be renamed to `Input.get_last_mouse_speed()` or similar.\r\n- `Tween.set_speed()` is confusing as it returns a scale, could be renamed to `set_speed_scale()` (#2060) Same with the property (#6935).\r\n\r\n## Singletons/Classes to split\r\n- `OS`, which has generic functions.\r\n  - Move to `Engine` singleton:\r\n    - `get_main_loop()`\r\n    - `is_debug_build()`\r\n    - `dump_{memory,resources}_to_file()`\r\n    - `{get,set}_iterations_per_second()`\r\n    - `{get,set}_target_fps()`\r\n    - `{get,set}_time_scale()`\r\n    - `get_engine_version()`\r\n## Functions to move\r\n- `Dictionary.parse_json()` -> `String.parse_json()`, since JSON can be dictionaries, arrays, or single values (#382, #3011, #4232).\r\n## Functions to change\r\n- `DirAccess::list_dir_begin` should return `Error` like other functions of this kind.\r\n## Functions to remove\r\n- `OS.set_video_mode()` (https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/3778#issuecomment-233447010).\r\n- `OS.get_fullscreen_mode_list()` (https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4624#issuecomment-218515473).\r\n## Properties to remove\r\n- `Expand` from `TextureFrame`.

is a duplicate of previous issues which have been closed without fully fixing the problem (#1959 #3835 #4667 #4686 #4713).\n\n**Operating system:**\nWindows 10 Pro 64bit 1511 Build 10586.420\n\n**Godot versions:**\n- 2.0.4.1 stable 32bit\n- 2.0.4.1 stable 64bit\n- 2.1-beta 20160712 32bit\n- 2.1-beta 20160712 64bit\n\n**Issue description:**\nTooltips on buttons blink on and off when mouse is not moving.\nTooltip stops blinking if mouse is moved, but only as long as the mouse pointer stays over the element that initially showed the tooltip.\nTooltip state stays unchanged, whether on or off, as long as the mouse keeps moving.\nWhen mouse stops moving, the tooltip starts flashing again.\nSometimes, when switching to another application, the tooltip stays on in the Editor.\nSometimes, tooltips just won't disappear even when the mouse pointer is over other parts of the interface.\nChanging tooltip_delay to a high value (like 10 seconds) may prevent tooltips from showing at all.\n\n![Tooltip blinking](http://i.imgur.com/RgLpW30.gif)\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tgtaQ0cLUo\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nCreate a project\nOpen project in editor\nMouse over any button with a tooltip\nLeave mouse pointer over the button\nTooltip regularly blinks on and off\nSlightly move the mouse over the button\nTooltip stops flashing\nStop moving the mouse\nTooltip starts flashing again\n\nAlt+Tab to another application\nMouse over any button with a tooltip\nJust as tooltip shows, rapidly move mouse outside of Editor window\nTooltip stays visible, without flashing\n\n**Link to minimal example project**\nBehavior shows with empty project\nDefault tooltip_delay is 0.7 sec.\n\n**Suspected culprits**\nThe software \"CleanMem Mini Monitor Free\" seems to enable this behavior on Windows 8.1 (but is not the only one).\nThe behavior seems to be related to root window handling, and/or mouse event handling.\nSuspicious code lines at https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/scene/main/viewport.cpp#L2275\n\n```\n    if (gui.tooltip == p_control)\n        gui.tooltip=NULL;\n    if (gui.tooltip == p_control) {\n        gui.tooltip=NULL;\n        _gui_cancel_tooltip();\n    }\n```\n\n(the second `if` seems to be a failed copy&paste, I'm not really sure what would be the correct way to fix it)\n\n**Notes**\nThe blinking detected on Windows 10 is slower, and has a different pattern, than that detected under Windows 8.1.\nBlinking speed seems to depend on something external to Godot.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5694","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5694/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5694/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5694/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5694","id":165571541,"number":5694,"title":"Plugins

system or device - Godot version:** All systems, Godot version 2.0.4.1 stable\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected): Position2D can be used for positioning their child nodes; however, those nodes are positioned to the center of the Position2D. Position2D is ALWAYS 20x20 pixels. Therefore, if I have a Position2D at 0,0 with its children having no offset, its children will actually be at 10,10. This can be undesirable, especially if using grid snapping to non-multiples of 10. Obviously there are workarounds, but to be able to set the size of the Position2D rect - and thus the position at which its children will actually be - would be very useful.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:** Place a Position2D node at 0,0. Turn Grid Snapping on. Add a child node of any type to the Position2D node, and set it also to 0,0. As you will see, it results in the child node being shown at 10,10.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5689","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5689/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5689/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5689/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5689","id":165541368,"number":5689,"title":"added

up and tries to reimport texture, but **sometimes** this causes infinite texture reloading loop, I have got a video: https://gfycat.com/EvenThinDiplodocus\nI have used Paint.NET to resave the image. Also I have my image stored outside of Godot project folder, I used Import window to import image as texture.

Sometimes after saving image this issue happens, not happens when just started up Godot. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5677","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5677/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5677/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5677/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5677","id":165354987,"number":5677,"title":"Removes AnimationPlayer renaming on import.","user":{"login":"SaracenOne","id":12756047,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/12756047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne","html_url":"https://github.com/SaracenOne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-07-13T15:47:02Z","updated_at":"2016-07-13T16:18:08Z","closed_at":"2016-07-13T15:49:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/5677","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5677","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5677.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5677.patch"},"body":"Fixes issue raised here #5622\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5677/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4787","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"C205:572D:133F6C7:2EC89FA:59D69CF1","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=207>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=205>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"076b5f0e5939b975c452055a86558764\"","status":"200 OK"}}
