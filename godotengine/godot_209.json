system or device - Godot version:**\nMageia 6 x64, Godot 2.0.3 and git HEAD (0e119a9).\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nThe contents of a RichTextLabel won't display at all if `bbcode/enabled` is false/unticked (which is btw the default value). It also behaves inconsistently in the editor and in running games:\n- In the editor, ticking `bbcode/enabled` will make the text appear, but unticking it won't make it disappear.\n- In the running game, it shows if ticked, and doesn't show if unticked.\n\nThe likely wanted behaviour is that `bbcode/enabled` toggles the parsing of BBCode tags, but not the display of the full text. I.e. a RichTextLabel with \"Hello [b]world[/b]\" should be displayed as \"Hello [b]world[/b]\" if `bbcode/enabled` is false, and as \"Hello **world**\" if `bbcode/enabled` is true.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n1.

Press CTRL + S.\n\nActually, it seems like the crash will occur if you just try to save `res://Basketball/Grandpa.tscn` in any capacity.\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome): \n[Crash.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/354868/Crash.zip)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5599/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5598","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5598/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5598/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5598/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5598","id":164578871,"number":5598,"title":"Fix own world option of Viewport.","user":{"login":"TheHX","id":8458222,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8458222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheHX","html_url":"https://github.com/TheHX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheHX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheHX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheHX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheHX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheHX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheHX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheHX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheHX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheHX/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-07-08T17:33:06Z","updated_at":"2016-07-08T18:45:19Z","closed_at":"2016-07-08T18:05:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/5598","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5598","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5598.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5598.patch"},"body":"It happens when the viewport has WorldEnviroment child with a valid Environment.
