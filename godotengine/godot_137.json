system or device - Godot version:** Windows 10 Pro x64 - latest Godot version as of date.\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\n\r\nThis feature (creating a file called **._sc_**)  allows godot to write the settings in the current folder which godot is executed. Windows Explorer limitations on file creation means that this error will popup:\r\n\r\n![ulj4yd0](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7162375/22760045/94a9f21a-ee33-11e6-8327-2bf301b26508.png)\r\n\r\nThis is bad UX. This means that the solution only works on Windows if a workaround is used (renaming the file via Command Line) which is not user-friendly at all.\r\n\r\nWhile a config setting would be preferred, this issue is fixed by requiring a file that works perfectly in every OS **without workarounds** (example: \"is_portable.txt\") . Another option would be to provide a download with this file previously created, so the user won't have to create anything.

on Godot 2.1.2, Windows 10 64 bits\r\n\r\nFrom this QA thread, there are issues with audio importing: https://godotengine.org/qa/12172/sound-fx-are-showing-as-empty-in-godot-project\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, a file (WAV 96000Hz) could not be imported, Godot logged this error:\r\n```\r\nERROR: ResourceFormatLoaderWAV::load: Format not supported for WAVE file (not PCM). Save WAVE files as uncompressed PCM instead.\r\n   At: scene\\io\\resource_format_wav.cpp:114\r\n```\r\nEdit: same with 48000Hz files as found by a user on Discord\r\n\r\nSo I normalized and exported from Audacity as WAV PCM, under a different name: [PistolDraw_reexport44n.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/759380/PistolDraw_reexport44n.zip)\r\nBut Godot still can't import it.\r\nWeirder, converted to OGG under another different name, still can't import it, the same error happens.\r\n\r\nWith the following settings each time;\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1311555/22717790/584cb032-ed9d-11e6-9701-db2da1e2b2e5.png)\r\n\r\nThis error is logged:\r\n```\r\nERROR: EditorSampleImportPlugin::import:

directly without import, provided that it was converted manually beforehand (which makes the importer useless).\r\n\r\nI know sound is being reworked for 3.0 as well as a part of the import system, but I don't think this was changed

coming back from GodotCon where I had a really interesting discussion with @Fabless about adding a sandbox feature in Godot. So here is a summary:\r\n\r\nGodot with GDscript acts a lot like a web browser with Javascript: a core generic engine running on the user's OS and interpreting some higher level script code.\r\n\r\nA cool feature about web browser is they enforce a sandbox pattern: no matter how bad or malicious the high level code is, it can never break you OS (well obviously as long as the sandbox doesn't have security hole !).\r\n\r\nHowever, the big difference with web is a Godot application is provided to the user with both the Godot generic engine and the GDscript code. So one can just add any malicious code to the Godot engine distributed inside his game to trivially bypass the sandbox...\r\n\r\nConsidering this, the sandbox would be a way not to protect the user from the game developer (you install it software, so you trust him), but to allow out-of-the-box modding.\r\n\r\nSo the player would be able to download 3rd party mods, put them in a `mod://` folder (this would shadow resources from `res://`) and have the guarantee that thanks to the sandbox only the game can break (just like if you download a bad chrome plugin, it can only mess with the webpages you consult - which is a lot scarier than messing with just a Godot game btw -, not with your entire OS).\r\n\r\n@Faless stated this is a dangerous pattern to trust unknown code and so modding should be a feature developers add with custom code, allowing to modders only to change configuration instead of having access to the GDscript.\r\n\r\nA quick search on the internet show that there is two way of adding mod into Unity: give full C# access (simple but dangerous way, chosen for example by [KSP](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/85372-mod-development-links-compilation-some-links-do-not-work-formatting-broken/)) or embed a lua interpreter and expose and API from there (see https://www.roguevector.com/category/mod-support/, https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/making-a-moddable-game.312490/ and https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/could-adding-modding-support-by-loading-modders-assemblies-create-risk-of-malicious-code.447879/)\r\n\r\nWhile I agree trusting unknown code is never good, being able to advertise Godot as a game engine with modding for free seems a big argument given how many indie games tends to build a community around this feature (Factorio, KSP, Minecraft etc.).\r\n\r\nIn the end, the question is the complexity to add a solid enough sandbox mode for GDscript vs. the benefit of providing powerful-but-safe-enough modding out of the box (I guess we could even provide on the Godot assets site a generic Godot app mods manager which would list the mod available and start the real game with a `--mod-path=...` option configured accordingly).\r\n\r\n@Faless thinks if available, this sandbox mode should be activated by default given most games would work pretty well with it and more security for the same price is always better ;-)\r\n\r\n\r\nImplementation\r\n==============\r\n\r\nThe idea would be to have a switch in the project configuration to enable/disable sandbox mode for the project.\r\n\r\nEnabling the sandbox mode would cause the following changes:\r\n\r\n\r\nStub OS singleton\r\n------------------------\r\nOS singleton contains dangerous methods which allow to manipulate processes\r\nsuch as:\r\n- execute\r\n- kill\r\n- shell_open\r\n- get_process_ID\r\n\r\nI think we could create a new `MethodFlags` (like `METHOD_FLAG_UNSAFE`) to easily flag those methods so implementing a check during call would be trivial.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimited load access\r\n--------------------------\r\nSandboxed mode should only allow `res://` and `user://` style of path for open.\r\nBeside, only `user://` should allow write mode.\r\nPath should be fully resolved before using it to make sure no malicious path (i.g. `user://../../secret.txt`) can go through the check.\r\n\r\n@Faless thing this could still be a trouble given a malicious program could try to write tons of dummy data into the filesystem in order to break it.\r\n\r\nWe could add rules to limit the size of the files that could be wrote, but then we will have to deal with program doing intensive small I/O to stall the HDD...\r\nThis is too cumbersome from my point of view, beside my guess is messing with the HDD this way is really visible and given the attacker cannot steal or destroy any user's information it is a minor issue.\r\n\r\nShared modules\r\n----------------------\r\nModders should not be able to provide .so modules given those just bypass the sandbox and can do anything. For the moment this is not a concern but this should be taken into account with @bojidar-bg  & @karroffel DLscript making it way to the master.\r\nA solution could be to allow DLscripts only to be loaded from `res://` (so `mod://` can't)\r\n\r\nProtect project settings !\r\n---------------------------------\r\nWe obviously have to make sure you can't temper the project settings when running it otherwise it would be trivial to disable the sandbox mode.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7753/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7752","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7752/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7752/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7752/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/7752","id":205992414,"number":7752,"title":"TabContainer's tab_changed signal runs every time you click tab","user":{"login":"ivanskodje","id":6776092,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6776092?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanskodje","html_url":"https://github.com/ivanskodje","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanskodje/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanskodje/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanskodje/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanskodje/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanskodje/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanskodje/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanskodje/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanskodje/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanskodje/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279537176,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/hacktoberfest","name":"hacktoberfest","color":"00eeee","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2017-02-07T19:39:43Z","updated_at":"2017-03-05T11:03:09Z","closed_at":"2017-03-05T11:03:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"<!--\r\nREADME: Incompatibilities and broken features in the current master branch / 3.0-alpha\r\nare known and expected due to important refactoring work, so no need to report them for now.
