This makes sense. If your game doesn't take up the whole screen when run, you always see the Output log when it's running. However, if another bottom panel—generally the animation panel, also the SampleLibrary panel that I know of, and probably others—is open when you hit play, the Output panel doesn't replace it. Unless the other open panel is the Debugger, that gets replaced by Output, which I'm assuming is the way it's supposed to work. (the way I expect it to work.) \n\nThis has been a constant annoyance to me for a long time, though I didn't think about it too much until now. I have often left the animation panel open when I press play, so then I look and don't see the output log, swear, pause the game, alt-tab to the editor, close the animation panel, open the output panel, alt-tab back to the game, and resume. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6029/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6028","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6028/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6028/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6028/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6028","id":169247043,"number":6028,"title":"Interpret comma as decimal point in editor","user":{"login":"rumangerst","id":7274739,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7274739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumangerst","html_url":"https://github.com/rumangerst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumangerst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumangerst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumangerst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumangerst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumangerst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumangerst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumangerst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumangerst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rumangerst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279537176,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/hacktoberfest","name":"hacktoberfest","color":"00eeee","default":false},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":283518733,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"007700","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-08-03T22:12:43Z","updated_at":"2017-05-19T11:30:13Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\nLinux (Manjaro) - v2.2 alpha (git custom build)\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nIf you use a German keyboard layout (and maybe other layouts), the \"decimal point\" is a comma.
