need a good plain-text resource format that is more readable, more friendly to version control systems, and doesn't change with every press of Ctrl+S even if nothing has been actually edited. \n\nOpen Data Description Language (http://www.openddl.org) syntax would be ideal for this (not using their library, if licensing is an issue, just copy the format). It looks very simple and human-readable. \n\nEverything needs to be sorted in a reproducible manner so that files only change when something has actually been changed.\n\nThe need for a new format had been mentioned by Juan in the past, but I didn't find an open issue about it in my quick search, so I opened this one.\n\nNOTE: I tried my hand at fixing the order that the current XML resource saver is writing out files. While I was able to get the changes to be less dramatic between saves, it still changed every time due to a few properties still not ordering correctly, and the external resources being a set means they can't easily be sorted like a list can (supposed to just sort itself, but that's not exactly happening in a predictable way). Maybe someone better at C++ than me can fix it in the meantime, but a better format would still be ideal in the long run, and much appreciated.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1166","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1166/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1166/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1166/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/1166","id":53950331,"number":1166,"title":"fix

discovered by Zyllan in the forums here: http://www.godotengine.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=1331\n\nFiltering still occurs when downscaling sprites though filtering is disabled.\nIn the demo project all sprites are instances from the same base sprite using the same texture, with filtering and mip maps turned off in flags and in project settings.\nAt 1X scale the static one looks fine but the rotating one filtering flickers on and off.\nAt less than 1X both are always filtered.\nAt greater than 1X both are never filtered as expected.\nIt looks like magnification filter is turned off but minification filter isn't.\nDemo project:

If you zoom right in and try and drag a curve handle, the distance it moves is a lot greater than the distance you move you mouse. This means a lot of the time the curve handle will quickly fly off and disappear from the view and you have to scroll to find it again.\n\nGreat work with Godot so far, though!
