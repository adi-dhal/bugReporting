If \"All Recognized\" is selected it will still show the \"Must use a valid extension.\" dialog.\n\nI think it might be good behavior to have this apply to something like the \"All Recognized\" as well and select the first option instead of the dialog. If you agree, let me know and I will add that functionality as well.\n\n---\n\nCommit 2:\n\nRemoved \"bin\" from the Linux export so that it will default to \"All Files\". This is due to myself and others experiencing an issue where several filemanagers such as Nautilus and LXDE will try and find a program to open the executable instead of just running it. If the build has no extension it works just fine. If the .bin extension is kept it will likely cause frustration and confusion to anyone not familiar with Linux who is trying to make a Linux port of their game. Also, while there are a few apps out there with it .bin is not a standard extension for executables in Linux. The typical thing done for almost every Linux app is to have no extension.\n\n---\n\nThanks,\nNathan\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1223/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1222","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1222/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1222/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1222/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/1222","id":54344818,"number":1222,"title":"shader

Godot Developers.\n\nFirst of all I want to thanks to all of you for creating great game engine with very permissive license. Your effort will help many developers and students with tight budget to fulfill they dream.\n\nWith current status of Godot, open source gaming will has brighter future. Unfortunately most of open source of game engine is designed with advanced user in mind with little knowledge about programming. It still cannot reach a beginner game maker.\n\nMy suggestion is to provide an easy to use game designer/editor with intuitive GUI and predefined class to ease the task of new programmer. More programmer means more user (because Godot user is game programmers).\n\nI know one game engine which do this job well. It is writen from Ruby, originally from Japan, and translated to English worldwide. It is called [RPG Maker VX Ace](http://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/programs/rpg-maker-vx-ace). Despite the RPG word in front of its name, it is capable enough to create non-RPG game with its built-in Ruby Game Scripting System (RGSS).\n\n![](http://gamesareevil.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/rpgmaker2.jpg)\n\nThe following list is example of games made with RPG Maker engine:\n1. [Aleph (RPG Adventure)](http://www.pioneervalleygames.com/)\n2. [ No Manatees Promised (Arcade)](http://rpgmaker.net/games/5102/)\n3. [Ragarokk - Bestiarium (Card Game)](http://rpgmaker.net/games/5808/)\n4. [Earth Under Attack! (Shooter)](http://rpgmaker.net/games/6561/)\n5. [Terra (VisualNovel)](http://rpgmaker.net/games/3956/)\n6. [Memories of Mana (Action RPG)](http://www.atelier-rgss.com/Project/Mana/Project_Mana_Story.html)\n7. [Myhos - The Beginning (Horror)](http://rpgmaker.net/games/6493/)\n\nI wish Godot engine become as popular as RPG Maker, because it has much more features than RPG Maker. Beginner programmer just need an easy to use interface. If it was success, Okam studio may become next GOG or Steam which publish thousands of games created by inde developers.\n\nRegards,Ryan\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1219","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1219/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1219/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1219/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/1219","id":54292740,"number":1219,"title":"set_shader_param autocompletes incorrectly","user":{"login":"romulox-x","id":7547356,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7547356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/romulox-x","html_url":"https://github.com/romulox-x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romulox-x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romulox-x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romulox-x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romulox-x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romulox-x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romulox-x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romulox-x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romulox-x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romulox-x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-01-14T07:39:09Z","updated_at":"2015-01-16T01:02:48Z","closed_at":"2015-01-16T01:02:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"get_material_override().set_shader_param suggests \"shader_param/variableName\", with no quotes.  the correct suggestion is \"variableName\", with the quotes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1218","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1218/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1218/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1218/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/1218","id":54292065,"number":1218,"title":"Option to startup Godot in fullscreen","user":{"login":"mamarilmanson","id":3820189,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3820189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mamarilmanson","html_url":"https://github.com/mamarilmanson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mamarilmanson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mamarilmanson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mamarilmanson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mamarilmanson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mamarilmanson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mamarilmanson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mamarilmanson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mamarilmanson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mamarilmanson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2015-01-14T07:26:52Z","updated_at":"2015-11-07T19:49:52Z","closed_at":"2015-11-07T19:49:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I sometimes find it frustrating that everytime I open the editor it just covers more or less 3/4 of my screen...
