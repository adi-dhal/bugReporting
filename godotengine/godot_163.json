Is there a way to tell the Object Database to bind that particular enum to another object (structs/base types do no allow)? Right now punto had them registering on the base type `int` like `int.IP_TYPE_IPV6`, `int.IP_TYPE_ANY`, and so on, which I think it's a bit confusing.\n\nEDIT: Also closes #4651 \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6981/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6980","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6980/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6980/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6980/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6980","id":186147172,"number":6980,"title":"Coding standards: Python files","user":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279097162,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/discussion","name":"discussion","color":"ee77ee","default":false},{"id":283518839,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"ffbbff","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":14,"created_at":"2016-10-30T16:45:36Z","updated_at":"2016-11-03T15:13:05Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"As a monolithic issue (#3916) does not make it easy to discuss specific points, let's split some topics in their own issue (always referencing the main one) so that we can progress forwards.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe have various Python files in the source, mostly related to the buildsystem or some helper scripts.\r\n\r\nI'd propose to follow the Python standard for those, PEP 8: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\r\nThe main disruptive change of PEP 8 for us would be that it enforces space indentation (:innocent:), while we currently have a stronger tendency to use tabs (though it's not done consistently and we have a lot of mixed situations).\r\n\r\nSince most auto-formatting tools enforce spaces, I'd propose to use that convention too for our Python files (not C++ of course, where we should stick to our _de facto_ tabs standard).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we can decide to use PEP 8 and tabs for indentation, we just need to tweak the PEP 8 checking tools to disable some warnings and errors related to indentation.

`.list_dir_begin( )` returns false and show an error in this case. But, the paths and directories was good so I commented the \"return\" in the \"if\". Even if `.list_dir_begin( )` returns false, the `.get_next( )` method returns the file & dirs in the targeted directory.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:** I used this code :\n\n```\nfunc _ready():\n\n    var

system or device - Godot version:**\nWindows 10, Godot Alpha 2.2 (October 29th- 30th)\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nAfter building latest Godot and running it, the UI seems to be broken. \n\nThe issue appears right away in the Project Manager: vertical slider of the project list is located in the middle of the list container, even though it should be aligned to the side.\n\nNext, scene tree simply doesn't work. The slider is aligned ok, however when I do scrolling the content doesn't scroll, just the scrollbar. When I select item, it is being selected in the 2d editor, however there is no indication in the scene tree. \nAlso two buttons overlap in the scene tree panel-> button with the plus icon and with a script icon.\n\nInspector is broken as well- the same as with the scene tree: there is no indication that something is being selected, some icons seems to be using hi-dpi and some low-dpi icon sets, however the scrolling is working.\n\nOther panels(Node, File System) are simply just messed up, everything is overlapping and it's impossible to make sense of anything there. \n\nAlso, after opening the project, the editor freezes for some time and when it gets back responsive, I noticed there are lots of error messages in the console; here are a couple of them:\nfailed method: TextureProgress:_update_callback target ID: 1640\n\n> failed method: TextureProgress:_update_callback target ID: 1640\n> TOTAL BYTES: 1048572\n> NULL count: 8\n> CALL : 87206\n> CALL _update_callback:

_update_minimum_size: 18\n> ERROR: MessageQueue::push_call: Condition ' (buffer_end+room_needed) >= buffer_size ' is true. returned: ERR_OUT_OF_MEMORY\n\nBasically it's the same error on and on just for the different nodes. \n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nSimply build the latest Godot alpha v2.2 and run it\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6974/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6973","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6973/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6973/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6973/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6973","id":186131165,"number":6973,"title":"Travis:

there's no option in GitHub to not show erroring jobs as broken, contrarily to Travis itself which makes a distinction between errors (!) and failures (x)).\n\nWe could also try moving the android
