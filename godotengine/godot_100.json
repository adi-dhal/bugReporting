advantage of the current UI changes being done for 3.0, I was thinking that we could also improve the menu buttons on the top.\r\n\r\n**Currently, the top-left is occupied by**\r\n- Scene\r\n- Tools\r\n- Export\r\n\r\nTools only have one item, making it actually kind of like a button.\r\nExport is a button, not a menu.\r\n\r\n**On the top-right:**\r\n- volume bar?\r\n- settings\r\n- weird icons that nobody understands what they are for :p\r\n\r\nI thought in 2 different proposals for a change:\r\n\r\n1. Collapse the top-left buttons into just one, maybe call it \"Project\"?. This means the scene menu will have 2 more items, and we get rid of tools and export, which are seldom used anyway.\r\n\r\n2. Since the space is not being used for anything else, make a more functional menu \"bar\", and split some items into different menus to make things easier to find. I'd also bring the Settings menu on the right, to join the left side. Project settings could be inside it, together with Editor Settings\r\n\r\nWDYT?
