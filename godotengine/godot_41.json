_enter_tree():\r\n\tconnect(\"item_rect_changed\", self, \"on_item_rect_changed\")\r\n\t\r\nfunc on_item_rect_changed():\r\n\tget_node(\"../circle\").set_position(transform *

changes in vertices do not seem to generate any signals. The least I would expect is to get a `item_rect_changed`. This is what this PR implements.\r\n\r\nObviously this is not an optimal solution, since changes to vertices do not actually imply item rect changes. So would introducing a new signal type \"vertices_changes\" be the better alternative?\r\n\r\n**EDIT** This PR no longer uses `item_rect_changed`, it now uses dedicated signal(s) and thus solves this last problem. ***END EDIT***\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10655/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10654","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10654/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10654/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10654/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/10654","id":253099645,"number":10654,"title":"Script editor crashing when performing autocomplete","user":{"login":"Calinou","id":180032,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/180032?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou","html_url":"https://github.com/Calinou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Calinou/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-08-26T15:06:31Z","updated_at":"2017-08-27T07:31:03Z","closed_at":"2017-08-27T00:05:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"**Operating system or device, Godot version, GPU Model and driver (if graphics related):** Windows 10, Godot Git https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/dd7145b778ea4884fd52f5efaf79dc55375c8465 compiled with MSVC 2017\r\n\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nThe script editor always crashes when performing autocomplete, which is usually done by editing characters in a script.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:** In the example project (see below), edit the `autoload/console.gd` script at line 55.
