After trying and somewhat failing to achieve some editor-customizations with the EditorPlugin and tools scripts (mainly with [tilemaps ](https://godotengine.org/qa/17659/tool-mode-possible-notified-tilemap-cell-was-changed-editor)) I dabbled a little with Unity and had a look at its very nice editor extensibility. You can look at the official [API](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/SceneManagement.EditorSceneManager.html) and some presentations of [cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNVT7hynBYw) and [useful](https://youtu.be/s1o0gZwJS-4) extensions some gamedevs wrote on youtube to get an idea of its possibilities.\r\n\r\nI want to ask if it is possible to expose more of the API of the editor to achieve similar things in Godot. Some examples of what would be cool to access from GDScript:\r\n- Inspector for custom formatting and input of node properties (i.e. float-ranges, arrays of strings as \r\n  comma separated string, drop-downs for Enums and custom types, etc.)\r\n- Main viewport for easier drawing of gizmos and debugstuff from a plugin and manipulation of position\r\n  and orientation of the camera. I know you can get the viewport from the EditorPlugin but drawing did \r\n  not really work for me due to me having coordinate system issues. Drawing from a tool node on the \r\n  other hand worked without a flaw. \r\n- TileMapEditor plugin for receiving events of cell filling for doing things like autotiling or doing custom \r\n  patterns\r\n- ScriptEditor for custom refactoring, code generation and annotation tools\r\n- AnimationPlayerEditor plugin for various visualizations and annotations\r\n- Opening, closing, saving and editing of scenes in background or loading multiple scenes in and out of \r\n  the current scene\r\n- Selection and deselection of nodes that also notifies corresponding plugins (like closing/opening \r\n  the TileMapEditor when a TileMap node is deselected/selected **from code**)\r\netc.\r\n\r\nI think this would be a huge benefit for the community, as the most important thing for productive gamedev is to have really good tools that are tailored to the game you are making or an easy way to build those on top of almost perfect tools.\r\n
