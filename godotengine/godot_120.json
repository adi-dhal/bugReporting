that the DLScript module is in master it would be nice to have a way to pass generic pointers between DLScripts or a DLScript and a module.\r\n\r\nThis new Variant field is not intended to be used in

It's only possible in C++/DLScript, so when using it in a script there's no danger of using it in unintended ways.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nI also added a function to the C API that lets you retrieve the

system or device - Godot version:**\r\nGodot 2.1 branch\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nI'm using a render target as a diffuse texture for a fixed material assigned in GDScript. Once the scene gets saved with this setup a sub_resource rendertargettexture entry gets added to the tscn but it is empty. After this the tscn file won't load until your remove the entry.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n1) create a new scene\r\n2) add some stuff so you have something to render\r\n3) add a viewport and set it as a render target\r\n4) add a camera for the viewport\r\n5) create a quad in your scene, create a new fixed material for it\r\n6) add a script to your scene, add tool at the start so code gets run and add the following line of code to _ready():\r\nget_node(\"Quad\").get_material_override().set_texture(FixedMaterial.PARAM_DIFFUSE, get_node(\"Viewport\").get_render_target_texture())\r\n7) reload the scene so the render targets output texture gets set to our quads material. The quad should now show a result.\r\n\r\nOnce the scene gets saved in this new state you end up with a broken tscn. I'm guessing the problem is that the rendertargettexture isn't setup and not linked to the viewport. Possibly I'm forgetting a step to make this work correctly..\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8258/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8257","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8257/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8257/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8257/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/8257","id":219212531,"number":8257,"title":"Tween function for single axis position/translation","user":{"login":"eon-s","id":10215987,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10215987?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eon-s","html_url":"https://github.com/eon-s","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eon-s/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eon-s/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eon-s/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eon-s/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eon-s/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eon-s/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eon-s/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eon-s/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eon-s/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-04-04T10:55:47Z","updated_at":"2017-05-20T16:11:53Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Godot 3 got better property access, making possible to move a node with something as simple as `translation.z += some_float`.\r\n\r\nBut Tween still does not have access to a single axis, it can only interpolate full translations or positions limiting the use of interpolation to full translation; if Tween is able to interpolate a single axis, it will allow more complex animations.\r\n\r\nI don't mind general vector item interpolation but only single axis position/translation for nodes, because these are the most used and may have their own complexity if involves transform.\r\n\r\nps: this could be a new method, like `interpolate_axis`, no need to alter the regular property access.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8257/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4873","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"CBC3:572D:133451C:2EAE18A:59D69B8D","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=121>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=119>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"595c70bbfc6a4c9f606c6b2f2d58a1c7\"","status":"200 OK"}}
