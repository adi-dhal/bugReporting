Few days ago I changed all my fonts into DynamicFont. It was working great. \n\nNow, when I import, the project imports fine for the first time, but fonts are not visible.\nThe paths to the fonts(in UI) are gone and size reset to 16. Colour of the fonts is changed to black, even if the font colour square shows (is checked) the proper colour I set for the font in previous version of Godot.\n\nAfter selecting the font again and changing colour, the font shows again. - it's size looks wrong, but can be changed.\n\nHowever, when I save the project in such state (with some of the fonts recreated and some not), or without recreating the fonts at all, but just opening the project and saving, it will not open again. It shows in the project manager, it starts to load, but after a while quits, leaving no error messages.\nThe last line I see in the terminal is:\n\n> bind toptions\n> LOCAL PATH: res://main_scene.scn from res://main_scene.scn\n\nI will try to reimport from backup and recreate all fonts, to see if that helps, so I will report back with the results.\n\n**REPORTING BACK:**\nUnfortunately repairing all the fonts and saving the project did not change anything.\nThe project does not open.\n### TEST PROJECT\n\n[check.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/297461/check.zip)\n\nTo recreate the bug one needs to:\n1.     scan projects directory form project manager\n2.     open the project from project manager\n3.     when project opens, save it right after it opens - do not correcting invisible fonts, or correct only one of the two labels.\n4.     quite project to project manager or quit Godot completely\n5.     repeat the process to open the project again - it fails to load.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5011/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5010","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5010/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5010/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5010/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5010","id":158267063,"number":5010,"title":"Global Font setting in Editor Settings broken.","user":{"login":"freemanfromgodotengine","id":11817561,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/11817561?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/freemanfromgodotengine","html_url":"https://github.com/freemanfromgodotengine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freemanfromgodotengine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freemanfromgodotengine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freemanfromgodotengine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freemanfromgodotengine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freemanfromgodotengine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freemanfromgodotengine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freemanfromgodotengine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freemanfromgodotengine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freemanfromgodotengine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-06-03T00:15:54Z","updated_at":"2016-06-12T00:16:46Z","closed_at":"2016-06-12T00:16:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Linux 64-bit, but I got a confirmation from OSX as well.
