It does apply to TRIANGLES though.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n1.  Create a scene laid out like so: \n\n```\n[Node]\n  \\- Camera\n  \\- Light Source\n  \\- MeshInstance\n```\n\nAdd a script to the MeshInstance for generating a mesh via surface tool.

Why not add a function like the following:\n- **retrieve_bpm_from_music** - automatic analysis of the audio to give the approximate value of BPM.\n- **get_volume** - getting the audio volume in the current frame.\n- **get_rms** - getting more \"soft\" audio volume value in the current frame\n- **and other...**\n## What is this for?\n\nFor example, I need to animate the mouth of the character based on a sample of his voice. The RMS value would help me to do this automatically through scripts. Or make a graphic equalizer which would have demonstrated the noise level around the character. In an extreme case, it opens up at least some space for creation of rhythm games and games based on music files.\n\nI know that usually respond to such requests, \"write your own plug-in\", but:\n- I do not know how to write plug-ins;\n- My friend, who understands the C language, says that writing such a plugin is problematic;\n- Such basic things should be in engine by defalt, such as a Construct Classic or Unity (which paid, non-optimized and hard-to-learn, meh!);\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6871/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6870","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6870/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6870/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6870/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6870","id":183992625,"number":6870,"title":"fragment shader : DISCARD does not work as expected","user":{"login":"SuperUserNameMan","id":9801802,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/9801802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan","html_url":"https://github.com/SuperUserNameMan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279098111,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:rendering","name":"topic:rendering","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-10-19T15:18:41Z","updated_at":"2017-09-05T18:25:14Z","closed_at":"2017-09-05T18:25:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Operating system or device -

For example, it allows to implement 3D outlines easily (draw mesh a second time, but extrude along normals, reverse normals and put it on an opaque pass), perform fur shading by duplicating layers of geometry in parts needing that, or implementing other cool effects that cannot be done in another way.\nIn Godot, shaders don't go beyond being shaders in the strict term of it. They cannot tell how many passes it has to be rendered properly. Because of that, the node must be duplicated (and then processed twice), or a script has to be added, a self-contained material is not enough. Could such capability be considered in the future?\n\nGeometry generation:\nGoing a bit further, possibly different area. I know it's possible today to generate geometry from shaders, and so not being forced to do it on the CPU, client-side towards the graphic card. For example, send a low-poly terrain on the graphic card, and subdivide it dynamically on the GPU (is tesselation the right word?). I know this is a fairly advanced topic and might not be supported by some graphic cards, but would it be possible to use it in Godot in the future?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6868/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6867","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6867/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6867/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6867/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6867","id":183903312,"number":6867,"title":"feature

Let's say I'm doing this with tween by starting two tweens (one of them is starting with delay)\nhere is the code:\n\n```\nfunc tweenToAndReturn(inTargetPos):\n    var modelCurrentPos = object.get_translation();\n    tween.interpolate_property(object, \"transform/translation\", modelCurrentPos, inTargetPos,0.3, Tween.TRANS_QUAD, Tween.EASE_IN);\n    tween.interpolate_property(object, \"transform/translation\", inTargetPos, modelCurrentPos,0.3, Tween.TRANS_QUAD, Tween.EASE_OUT,0.3);\n    tween.start();\n```\n\nHere is how it works before #6613  (or with #6613 but also with  #6863) \n![tween-sequence-1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6129594/19494768/e112192c-9580-11e6-8440-58daab39f53d.gif)\n\nHere is how it works with #6613\n![tween-sequence-2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6129594/19494799/05cdd7ba-9581-11e6-8007-21a09722184a.gif)\n\nI'm not sure what's happening exactly, but first thought is that delay parameter of `interpolate_property` is for some reason ignored in #6613 (or this interpolation is already killed at the time it need to start)\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n1. Check sample project without  #6613 testCube will be able to return to it's initial position\n2. Apply #6613 testCube won't be able to return to it's initial position\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very

it is pretty long to make a Vector3 out of a Vector2:\n\n``` gdscript\nVector3(vec2.x, vec2.y, 0)\n```\n\nSame goes for vice-versa:\n\n``` gdscript\nVector2(vec3.x, vec3.y)\n```\n\nNow, imagine that the said Vector3/Vector2 has a very long name.. It would quickly become unmanageble, right? :smile: \n\n---\n\nThat's why, I would like to propose (after a quick discussion with @karroffel and @reduz) a few utility constructors, similar to the shading language (which should be non-implicit, to minimize bugs):\n\n``` gdscript\nfunc Vector3(Vector2 xy, float z = 0):\nfunc Vector3(float x = 0, Vector2 yz):\nfunc Vector2(Vector3 xy):\n```\n\nNow, the only few issues with this is that you can't:\n1. Make `Vector3(v2.y, v2.x, 0)`, for example\n2. Make `Vector2(v3.z, v3.x)`, which might need swizzling to work properly.\n\nAnyway, what do you think of the proposed constructors? And also, do you think swizzling (`v3.xz`) is useful enough to include in GDScript?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6861/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6860","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6860/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6860/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6860/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6860","id":183633927,"number":6860,"title":"Incorrect positioning of fields on Mac Retina","user":{"login":"BastiaanOlij","id":1945449,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1945449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij","html_url":"https://github.com/BastiaanOlij","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":283518733,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"007700","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-10-18T09:27:12Z","updated_at":"2017-02-19T08:40:42Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\nMac OS X 11.6, Retina Mac Book Pro running at highest scale setting (though other scale settings have same behaviour)\nGodot 2.1 and 2.1.1 RC\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nObject seem wrongly positioned or too large, for instance the preview button for the selected camera:\n![Preview camera](http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l136/Mux213/th_Preview%20hidden.png)\nhttp://s95.photobucket.com/user/Mux213/media/Preview%20hidden.png.html\n\nPopup for entering coordinates/rotations has text overlapping:\n![Popup](http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l136/Mux213/th_Coordinate%20popups.png)\nhttp://s95.photobucket.com/user/Mux213/media/Coordinate%20popups.png.html\n\nSaw some more in other places but most likely all the same cause.

is a breaking change idea/suggestion/request:\n\nPathFollow is a great tool but it requires to cut branches and reparenting poor children just to follow a path for awhile.\n\nI was messing around in GDScript and nodes trying some approaches to see how could it be more flexible and got 2 ideas:\n- One is that PathFollow can have a list of follower nodes from the scene and each member assigned an offset too.\n\n![pathfollowers](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10215987/19450001/1cf1090c-947e-11e6-90e7-c1f6917de8ea.gif)\n\nThat way, a single pathfollow can move N nodes without altering the scene tree, allowing add and remove easily from following a path, even push nodes in a trail.\n- The other idea that was thinking is make the PathFollow a parasite.\n\n![brainslug](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10215987/19450172/c131be58-947e-11e6-804e-390a0c2a9f38.png)\n\nIf a pathfollow is added as child of a node and assigned to a path in the scene (like a ParticleAttractor to an Emitter), it will move the parent along the path, this way could be more flexible than the other but harder to make a trail of nodes.\n- Another not so breaking option could be that depending on who is the parent of PathFollow it could behave as now ( _or as the first idea which is a breaking one_ ) or with the second mode (if parent is not a path).\n\nps: I'm still bad with plugins so don't know if can be just done with that while keeping a simple/transparent way to use (the second idea sounds

In many games, a subtle change of speed in the music can change the feel of the game. For example, someone making a Tetris game might want to speed up the music slightly when the block fall speed increases, or a platformer may want to increase speed when time starts running low, or a boss battle might want its music sped up when its health is down. Currently these effects can be emulated by actually creating different audio streams at different speeds, but this seems like a somewhat less than optimal solution (it takes time and adds more files to the project).\n\nI wasn't sure if this was planned already, but I hadn't seen anything saying it was.

What do you think of them? Any ideas you'd like to add / modify to this?\n### Results in a separate object\n\nPreviously, the results would be stored as a mutable variable in the expression object. I don't think it's a good principle to have a constant function `ex.find()` to affect the state of `ex`. I originally did this because that was how it was done and I was worried about backwards compatibility. What I propose is to instead return a separate object called RegExMatch, similar to [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html):\n\nCurrent:\n\n```\nvar ex = RegEx.new()\nex.compile(\"Name: (\\\\w+)\")\nif ex.find(\"ID: 003\\nName: John Doe\"):\n    print(ex.get_capture(1))\n    print(ex.get_capture_start(1))\n```\n\nNew (Proposed):\n\n```\nvar ex = RegEx.new()\nex.compile(\"Name: (\\\\w+)\")\nvar match = ex.match(\"ID: 003\\nName: John Doe\")\nif match != null:\n    print(match.get_group(1))\n    print(match.get_pos(1))\n```\n### RegEx as a resource file\n\nOne annoyance I've had making use of the RegEx class is writing escapes because I have to escape the string before I can escape the expression, e.g. \"\\w\" -> \\w or worse \"\\\\\" -> \\. Furthermore, the lack of access to constructors in the script means if you want to use them as a class member, it has to be compiled separately:\n\n```\nvar re_string = RegEx.new()\nvar re_comments = RegEx.new()\n# Some code\nfunc _init():\n    re_string.compile(\"\\\"([^\\\"]|\\\\\\\\.)*\\\"\")\n    re_comments.compile(\"#.*\")\n# Some more code\nfunc _input(delta):\n    # Actually use re_string and re_comments\n    pass\n```\n\nOne way to fix all this is to make it a resource class instead, where you can edit it in the properties window, save it as a file, and load it separately, like:\n\n```\nvar re_string = load(\"res://regex/string.tres\")\nfunc _input(event):\n    # With resource caching, it should only be loaded once\n    var re_string2 = load(\"res://regex/string.tres\")\n    # The old method should still work\n    var re_comments = RegEx.new()\n    re_comments.compile(\"#.*\")\n```\n### Other ideas\n\nBy integrating more closely with Godot, it should now be possible to add:\n- Substitution\n- Named groups\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6853/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6852","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6852/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6852/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6852/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6852","id":183400567,"number":6852,"title":"Documentation for group methods needed","user":{"login":"rgrams","id":11370192,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11370192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgrams","html_url":"https://github.com/rgrams","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgrams/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgrams/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgrams/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgrams/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgrams/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgrams/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgrams/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgrams/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgrams/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":283518839,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"ffbbff","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-10-17T12:17:56Z","updated_at":"2016-10-18T13:54:38Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:** All (docs)\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nSome important details about methods pertaining to groups are missing from the docs.
