added support to the Python script responsible for scanning and exposing the data of the native GLSL into headers to be able to use the #include directive. Since this is a precompiler routine, there are no concerns over driver compatibility, and these additions should also provide protection from recursion or double inclusion. The reason I wanted to add this is thought that if the builtin shaders are going to grow in complexity in the future, it may be an idea to refactor into sets of more managable submodules. Currently, the ubershaders used are quite difficult to follow since composed almost entirely of #ifdefs. In future, I would also like to add similar functionality to user shaders too\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4505/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4504","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4504/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4504/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4504/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4504","id":152197653,"number":4504,"title":"Prompt for unsaved scene changes checks incorrect scene","user":{"login":"RayKoopa","id":9631152,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/9631152?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa","html_url":"https://github.com/RayKoopa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279128044,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/confirmed","name":"confirmed","color":"66dd66","default":false},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-05-01T12:49:31Z","updated_at":"2016-05-03T05:33:11Z","closed_at":"2016-05-03T05:33:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Operating system or device:**\nWindows 10 Pro x64\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nThe check to ask for closing the scene in case of unsaved changes checks the currently displayed scene, not the scene which tab is about to be closed.\n\nThis creates two issues:\n- The current scene has unsaved changes; closing tabs of saved scenes creates a misleading prompt: \"Please Confirm...: Close scene?

This issue only seems to occur with BoxShape colliders; things like SphereShapes and CapsuleShapes do not seem to suffer from the same issue when scaled up.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4491/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4490","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4490/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4490/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4490/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4490","id":151973126,"number":4490,"title":"C++11 support for linux build - needed to compile creature2d module","user":{"login":"blurymind","id":6495061,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6495061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blurymind","html_url":"https://github.com/blurymind","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blurymind/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blurymind/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blurymind/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blurymind/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blurymind/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blurymind/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blurymind/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blurymind/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blurymind/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":28,"created_at":"2016-04-29T21:32:01Z","updated_at":"2016-07-18T08:23:43Z","closed_at":"2016-05-01T15:08:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I've been trying to build godot with support for creature2d.

various XML tags in the classes.xml template produced by doctool don't have the same expectations regarding the need for indentation.\n\nFor example `<description>` expects no additional indentation level:\n\n```\n<description>\nReturn the label used for built-in text.\n</description>\n```\n\nWhile `<constant>` expects an indentation:\n\n```\n<constant name=\"NO_INDEX_ARRAY\" value=\"-1\">\n    Default value used for index_array_len when no indices are present.\n</constant>\n<constant name=\"ARRAY_WEIGHTS_SIZE\" value=\"4\">\n    Amount of weights/bone indices per vertex (always 4).\n</constant>\n```\n\nMost IDEs seem to increment the indentation level after `<description>`, or at least 90% of the documentation writers add one, which always gets reverted when running doctool again, producing needlessly verbose diffs.\n\nWe need to settle on one convention, implement it in doctool and enforce it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4482","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4482/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4482/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4482/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4482","id":151819419,"number":4482,"title":"Add

using complex 3D setups you basically need to know what part of collision your shape represents. For example, your character can walk, lay on sofa, sit on chair. All these poses (and transitions!) require different collision setups to avoid unwanted behavior. Another example is multi-character animations, where we want to selectively disable collision bodies. Or, entering a car.\n\nTo select a body to disable or move you need to identify it. You can loop through bodies in collision object, but you can't identify which is which. Ref<Shape> do not know about names.\none can set names for shapes in GDScript, but not in C++ for some reason.
