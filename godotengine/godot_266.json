Afaik it's the only platform that doesn't have this feature (apart from \"experimental\" stuff like haiku/blackberry).\n\nI plan on working on this as soon as I get my hands on a mac, but if anyone else wants to step in before this happens, here's what you'd need to do:\n- learn how osx handles gamepad input\n- figure out how SDL2 generates the gamepad GUIDs and how it orders the buttons/axes\n- Call `InputDefault::joy_connection_changed()` on device (dis-)connection and provide it with the device id(starting at 0), name and guid\n- recieve gamepad events and send them to the engine using `InputDefault::joy_button`, `joy_axis` and `joy_hat` with the numbering SDL uses (joy_hat takes a bitmask as argument, e.g `InputDefault::HAT_MASK_LEFT | InputDefault::HAT_MASK_DOWN`)\n\nIt would be a good idea to read the events in a seperate thread, queue them and send them to the engine once per frame (right before or after it handles keyboard input). You won't have to worry about checking for duplicate events, InputDefault does that for you.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3881/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3880","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3880/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3880/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3880/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3880","id":137292362,"number":3880,"title":"use

Worse if the scene is then closed (but the script generated was modified and saved) it becomes impossible to reattach the orphaned script because the create script wizard sees the file already exists,\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n\ncreate new scene\nadd a root node (I used a Node2D)\nsave the scene\nuse script wizard to create script for the node\nedit script content then save the script (not the scene) in the script editor\n\n[at this point the scene is still \"dirty\" as it has an unsaved script relationship that will be lost if the scene is closed at this point.  however Godot editor is not aware of this and thus not indicating it to the user with a \\* nor warning the user when the scene (or godot editor) is subsequently closed. if the designer gets interrupted AFK while the scene is in this state there is a good probability the scene will be closed and the unsaved script relationship lost.  Furthermore it will become impossible to reattach the scene when the user reloads the scene (and finds it no longer links the script) since the wizard complains that the file already exists.]\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\n\nThe reproduction is simple enough I doubt a project is needed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3878","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3878/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3878/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3878/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/3878","id":137225693,"number":3878,"title":"Incorrect saving of files.","user":{"login":"Timofffee","id":5556081,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5556081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Timofffee","html_url":"https://github.com/Timofffee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Timofffee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Timofffee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Timofffee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Timofffee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Timofffee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Timofffee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Timofffee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Timofffee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Timofffee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-02-29T11:23:36Z","updated_at":"2016-06-24T14:15:57Z","closed_at":"2016-06-24T14:11:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":" **Operating system or device:** Windows 8 / ArchLinux\n\n**Issue description**: \nIn assembled form, the draft can't save variables to a file.
