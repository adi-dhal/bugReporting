an image resource from the FileSystem panel onto a node in the Scene panel should create a Sprite node whose texture is the dragged file, where its position is 0, 0 relative to its parent.\r\n\r\nMy reasoning is thus:\r\n1. This behavior is intuitive, and having more ways to do the same thing accommodates more users.\r\n2. It doesn't override any existing behavior.\r\n3. To my knowledge, the fastest existing way to create a Sprite child node at 0, 0 with the desired texture (which IMO is the most common desire for Sprites) is to use the manual insert child node menu, selecting Sprite, and choosing the texture property manually; or to drag the texture resource to the editor while its desired parent is selected, and then manually changing the position to 0, 0 in the Inspector panel.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10684/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10683","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10683/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10683/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10683/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10683","id":253146471,"number":10683,"title":"Fix
