system or device - Godot version:**\r\n- Windows 10, Godot Steam (2.1?)\r\n- Haven't tested version 3.0\r\n\r\n**Issue description:** I am moving a KinematicBody2D towards another collision body. The collision body has a complex and dense polygon shape inside. When you use KinematicBody2D::move near a dense number of polygon vertices, the KinematicBody2D does not register a collision _but_ it get's immediately shoved outside of the other body.\r\n\r\n<!-- What happened, and what was expected. -->\r\n**Expected:** KinematicBody2D will move (from within another polygon2d) and if pushed back register a collision.\r\n**Actual:** KinematicBody2D gets wildly thrown somewhere and does not register a collision.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n_Probably better to just skip to the project._\r\n1.  Create a kinematic character you will move around \r\n2.  Create a collision body (_any_) and give it a collision polygon which has as many polygon fragments as you can fit in\r\n3. Add code to move around for your character\r\n4. If there was a collision in your move, revert it, temporarily ignore and move again (yes through the obstacle )\r\n5. If there was not a collision, compare the distance travelled to the vector used for move. If it is vastly different, you've found the glitch.\r\n\r\n_Notes:_ This happens in areas I believe with vertices that 2 or 3 or more polygons connect to in a shape.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**[gd_bug_example.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/1226287/gd_bug_example.zip)\r\n\r\nThis project will demonstrate it best.

Basically I have a scene that creates 12 SceneTrees and initiate the same given PackedScene in it. These 12 simulations are iterated by the main scene using the MainLoop's iteration function.\r\n\r\nI do that in order to be able to speed up or slow down at will the simulations. Sadly, it seems that the physics aren't affected by this. For example, if I speed every 8 times, things handled by my scripts will be sped up 8 times, but an object falling due to gravity is going to move the exact same way instead of moving 8 time faster.\r\n\r\nI could micro manage this by increase by 8 the gravity. But this feels bad.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to do what I want to do? Am I using MainLoop properly?

Run the scene using any method (F5, F6 or Ctrl+Shift+F5, there's no difference).\r\n\r\nThe game window appears but you can see that the Inspector pane in the Godot editor becomes empty even with a
