Below it are several other UI controls. The PopupPanel is displayed with show() and is exclusive. (The bug also occurs with popup() and non-exclusive popups.) When the OptionButton is clicked, it displays its item list. Clicks on the item list above the PopupPanel's other UI controls are delivered to those controls instead of the OptionButton's item list. Expected behavior is that the OptionButton's item list will receive the clicks, since it is the top item.\r\n\r\nThis issue appears to be a general issue with any stacked popup. In a more complicated project, I have a windowdialog which displays above another windowdialog. Clicks to the top windowdialog are delivered preferentially to any clickable UI control in the bottom windowdialog, rather than to the top windowdialog as would be expected.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n 1. Create a popup of some kind.\r\n 2. To the first popup, add another popup.\r\n 3. To the first popup, add some additional UI controls.\r\n 4. Display the first popup, then display the second popup.\r\n 5. Observe that clicks on the second popup, when they occur above the first popup's controls, are delivered to the first popup's controls instead of the second popup.\r\n\r\n**Demo project:**\r\nThis project contains a minimal demo of the issue.
