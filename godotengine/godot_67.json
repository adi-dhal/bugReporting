If for something that's a lot less popular it's very slow. In my own project search speed for some scenes is bearable, but others take dozens of seconds (to the point that it looks very similar how 'some' search is performed on this video, at the same time project have a lot less files, but a lot greater variety of names).\r\n\r\nI don't have idea that's the reason of that but I'm suspecting it's the way how fuzzy search is working. As far as I noticed it's doing fuzzy search on full file path not only on a name, this also can be  confusing on a bigger projects since quite often after typing something the results are not so helpful as they could be: \r\n![coin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6129594/28615144-5cf86894-71f8-11e7-9556-ec66876e1d6a.gif)\r\n\r\nI don't know how to solve this issue, but maybe for the begging we could start with an option to do fuzzy search only on filenames? \r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n1.
