You'll notice that with `self.`, the time to execute the scene dramatically increases. It might not even be performance issue but just some bug related to the nested for loops because it takes a while to initialize and start the scene, not really to execute the script now that I think about it.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nMake for loops (maybe only for nested for loops?!) and access a variable with `self.`.\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\nI've uploaded a project file demonstrating the issue with comment in `map.gd` script where it makes the difference.\n[godot_debug.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/332930/godot_debug.zip)\n\nIt's a pity cause I really like using `self.` because it's more explicit and I'm an adept of the philosophy of code readability (over conciseness).

\"Input.set_mouse_mode(Input.MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED)\"\nthe problem is when I add a new feature i get issues in the code just like every other human and when issues happen the editor pops up which is the problem, the mouse is still captured i can't type anything and can't use the editor's shortcuts to stop debugging or even close the window with \"Alt+F4\" the Ubuntu shortcut\n\n**My Wish**\nAdd some feature that returns the mouse mode to un-captured, or saves the system's state before debugging the game and redo it when there are issues because the only solution that I can do is RESTART the computer which is why my development is

the iterative approach currently used by the standard fmod() function.\nAlso fixes infinite looping that happens when the mirroring value is negative. *\n\n*: Negative mirroring can make things look better in the editor when your 2D game scrolls \"backwards\". For instance, if your level scrolls from bottom to top and you have placed a parallax layer so its bottom edge matches the bottom edge of the initial viewport, by setting a negative Y mirroring, the mirror piece will be placed above, on level space instead of outside. Not very important and achievable perhaps by transforms but at least we get rid of the infinite loop in case someone tries.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5391/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5390","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5390/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5390/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5390/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5390","id":162190082,"number":5390,"title":"Fix

system or device - Godot version:**\nAny OS - Godot 2.X\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\n\nI'm trying to get the best performance out of a scene of mine that plays a video and adds subtitles (thanks to a custom GDScript I wrote).  \nThe video is played via a VideoStreamTheora and handled by a VideoPlayer Node.\n\nNow, my scene constantly checks if the video is still playing so that it can move on when it stops. I've been looking around in godot's code and I can't find out the source of the `is_playing()` since it points to a `playback->is_playing()` (I think it checks for a bool value?), but anyways, I believe a signal would lay off a little bit — if not more — stress out of CPU (on a side note, I see that Theora drops many frames).\n\nSo, I looked at the signals singleton but found out (remembered, actually) that \"finished\" is already a signal that exists for animation, so I'm not sure if the signal can conflict with the video if we were to point both towards it. If this is the case, it's best to make a signal entirely for streaming.  \nIf this is not feasible, what can be an alternative?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5377/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4777","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"DB00:572C:1517C3A:29E21F7:59D69D1C","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=217>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=215>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"67de505e09eed571a3ae6efbe3b8f6a4\"","status":"200 OK"}}
