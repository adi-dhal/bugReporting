mentioned in 3db3668 and listed in #5248, we currently bundled external libraries / third party code in various locations: `core/`, `drivers/`, `modules/`, `platform/`, `scene/`, `servers/` (code snippets that we arguably \"upstreamed\") `tools/`.\n\nThis is messy and makes it very hard to keep track of the current versions we're using, whether we patched them, whether we can safely update them to the latest upstream version or if the engine will blow up, etc.\n\nThis also makes it practically impossible for us to be packaged for major Linux distros like Fedora or Debian which have very strong requirements on the stuff they package. If they need to write 15 patches to unbundle our libraries and use the system ones, they'll likely just give up.\n\nSanitising all this would also make it clearer what is covered by our MIT license and copyright and what is not. Many of the permissive licenses of those libraries (especially BSD-like) _require_ use to credit and mention the upstream project and license when using the source in binary form... which we obviously don't do so far, and Godot users even less.\n\n---\n\nMy proposal would be to move all external libraries to a `thirdparty`, `external` or `libs` folder (cast your votes :)). Those libraries would be unmodified upstream versions as far as possible (if modified, this would have to be properly documented for each library).\n\nThe Godot-specific code for which these libraries are needed should be left out of this folder and kept in the relevant locations, e.g. `drivers/`. To give an example, `drivers/openssl` contains Godot-specific code to make use of OpenSSL features, whether builtin or shared, so this is good (apart from the cURL snippet ;)). `drivers/builtin_openssl2` contains the pristine upstream source code + our SCsub to build it, and should be moved to `thirdparty/openssl`.\n\nIdeally, one should be able to build Godot after `rm -rf thirdparty` provided that all development headers are installed on the system and that no `=builtin` option was passed to the buildsystem.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6157/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4803","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"D6BB:572D:133D83B:2EC4188:59D69CAE","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=191>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=189>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"95f1179a4a7f2c844c4db1c76a03dcb7\"","status":"200 OK"}}
