simple idea, one set of sprites, and in order to generate an sd version of your game all you do is reduce the sprites by 2(half) export the new set and be happy.

However **resizing them once you export them in an atlas**, that does work, but it does that in a way that leaves questions... \n\nYou can see the black borders in the picture(the orig tex were 32x32 btw), I'm guessing it has to do with the way atlasses are handled.

cant tell the quality in a numerical fashion, unlike in any other instance where the slider shows up, across the editor.\nIt could follow the same approach done all over, of having a number and arrows with it, or in this case, simply a tools when you hover over with the current value would do.\n\nPersonally i'd prefer the std way to be used, for the sake of cohesiveness.\n\nAlso, what in the world
