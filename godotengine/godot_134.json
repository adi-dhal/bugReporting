new property (factor) with each mouse button event. this factor is 1 by default and any action taken with the scroll even will be multiplied with the factor.\r\nWith the macOS trackpads I now can sent hundreds of scroll events and the scrolling is smooth.\r\n#7559 solves the issue of fast scrolling by waiting for enough events that a total scroll offset of one is reached and than sends the event.

changes modify the build process for `platform=javascript` so that no manual zipping is necessary, the output is a `godot.opt(.debug)(.webassembly).zip` file that must only be renamed to either `javascript_release.zip` or `javascript_debug.zip`.\r\n\r\nAlso correctly sets the unique suffix for WebAssembly build files, so it's possible to switch between building asm.js and WebAssembly without completely rebuilding every time.\r\n\r\nAlso fix building WebAssembly and asm.js on Windows\r\nActually building and running 3.0 web builds is not yet working though, see

been playing around with the new Multiplayer API and I noticed there is a huge security/logic issue.\r\n\r\nEach node can be in either Master or Slave mode.\r\nIf the node is set to **slave** it will **accept RPC** from other nodes.\r\nThe problem is that there is **no way of knowing which peer called** that remote procedure.\r\n\r\nI think there are two ways to deal with this problem:\r\n\r\n1. Let the user handle it in his own networking function\r\n   @reduz suggested adding something like `SceneTree::get_rpc_id()` to get the called ID.\r\n   This will require the user to check that value in every RPC and it's state outisde RPCs\r\n   might become confusing\r\n\r\n2. Have the user specify which network peer actually owns a node. The idea is: \r\n   - Add new functions `set_owner_network_id(id)` and `get_owner_network_id()` to configure which client ID\r\n     is allowed to call RPC on that node.\r\n   - The engine will discard received RPC automaticaly if the caller ID is different from the one configured locally to own that node.\r\n     - Optionally, as suggested by @reduz could report a `client_misbehave` signal\r\n     - Optionally, expose client kicking to GDScript (supported by ENet, both nicely and forcefully). Probably dedicated feature/PR.\r\n   - Additionally I think we could get rid of the `master`/`slave` GDScript keyword and just keep `remote` and `sync`.\r\n   - Nodes should inherit owner like the current master/slave mode (which could be removed).\r\n   - `is_network_master` will then bascially be a check if the remote owner ID is the same as the current network ID.\r\n   - The node is owned by the local peer unless specified otherwise.\r\n     - Optionally we could automatically intherit `1` (ID of the server) if no override is set and the SceneTree network peer is a client peer.\r\n       (bascially, clients will be \"slave of the server\" unless otherwise specified).\r\n\r\nOption 1 is fastest and easier to implement, but I feel like it's a bit hacky. An will require more effort from users.\r\n\r\nOption 2 is a bit more complex and will require more work on the engine. But I feel the structure would be more robust and save a lot of time to game developers.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\n\r\nI've setup a small repo with a simple client/server architecture using the Multiplayer API.\r\nI plan to setup a small test set to check for regressions / behavior complaince in the future: inheritance, cheating attempt, correct delivery client<->server, and client<->client (will still go through the server, but not call on it).\r\nYou can [check it out here](https://github.com/Faless/gd-multiplayer-test).\r\nFor now only the impersonation test is shown.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7853/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7852","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7852/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7852/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7852/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7852","id":208885283,"number":7852,"title":"Cache DynamicFont resource for Android (2.1)","user":{"login":"volzhs","id":8281454,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8281454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/volzhs","html_url":"https://github.com/volzhs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volzhs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volzhs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volzhs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volzhs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volzhs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volzhs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volzhs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volzhs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volzhs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279097562,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:android","name":"platform:android","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-02-20T13:50:29Z","updated_at":"2017-03-18T15:15:16Z","closed_at":"2017-02-27T22:35:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/7852","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7852","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7852.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7852.patch"},"body":"Tested with 16.5MB otf font file\r\n* NotoSansCJKkr-Medium.otf -
