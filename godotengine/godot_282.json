you have an instanced scene, and want to change values in any SpinBox within the inspector by clicking the arrows, the \"revert\" button appears at every 2nd click on an arrow and by that causes an annoying resizing of the SpinBox. 1st click = revert appears, 2nd click = disappears, 3rd = appears, ....\n\nThe problem here is, that by resizing the SpinBox, the arrow buttons move around every time you click them. So you can't make a simple _klick, klick, klick_ to add +3 quickly, you always have to move around the mouse to find that arrow key again.
