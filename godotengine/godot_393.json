there,\n\nI found that the Surface Pro's touch screen is not detected by Godot, even when using Emulate Touch Screen in the prefs.  TouchScreenButtons do not seem to receive touches.\n\nOn Windows 8, if emulate touch screen is active and you're on a system where multitouch is supported, it'd be nice for Godot to switch and allow the touch screen buttons to work correctly.  However, if emulate touch screen is off, Windows 8 should react as would a regular desktop system.\n\nAs an aside, it would also be nice if Surface Pro swipes, pinches, and two-finger pans worked in the editor.  Swiping would scroll lists (which it tries to do currently, but when you release it changes the selected item; scrolling in the code editor with a finger does not work and would be preferable to trying to select), two-fingers would pan viewports, and pinches could be used for zooms.  Perhaps a double-tap with a finger in the game viewport could also return to default zoom.\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/90/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/89","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/89/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/89/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/89/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/89","id":27650801,"number":89,"title":"Fix

I extracted Godot from the ZIP file downloaded from the website.\n2. I placed the Godot application in my Applications directory.\n3. I launched Godot and it opened perfectly fine, as expected.\n4. I closed Godot.\n5. I reopened Godot and was given the error \"Godot quit unexpectedly\".\n6. I attempted to select \"Reopen\" on the error message window and continued to get the same error message and was unable to open Godot.\n\nAttempted Solutions:\n1. I moved the Godot application to my trash bin and emptied my trash.\n2. I re-extracted the application from the original ZIP file.\n3. I moved the application to my Application directory (same location as first attempt).\n4. I reopened the Godot application and the application opened without any issues.\n5. I closed the application again.\n6. I reopened the application and got the same error message as before, and was unable to open Godot.\n7. I repeated the earlier steps and it works just the same. The first time I open the application, it works just fine, but as soon as I attempt to reopen the application after closing it, it fails.\n\nMy computer specs:\nApple iMac (2007)\nMac OS X

Some sort of special editor displaying all the widgets does come up. But it's not at all obvious what to do with it. I can click on the Theme menu and get some sort of Add dialog for specific parts of specific elements.\n\nSo let's say I want to change the entire GUI in my application to use a certain font. Everything should use this font. But it seems like you can only theme things on a per-class basis. So I decided, okay, let's start with the label. I add the label, it gives me the style options I'm used to. I set the font... and nothing happens. The label in the view looks exactly the same. I later discover you have to navigate away from the theme and go back for the change to appear. That's not good.\n\nOkay... well, what I was really interested in is changing the fonts on buttons since that's impossible to do in the regular gui building view. So I add every item for the button class. ...there is no way to change the font. What?! That's exactly like the regular gui building view!\n\nNot only that, but it does not seem that there is any way to apply this theme in the gui editor. It can be done programmatically using Control.set_theme... but that's no good because then you're basically going blind at that point; you don't know what your gui will look like with the theme until you run it.\n\nSo how exactly am I supposed to set the font, or heck, _anything_, on a gui-wide basis and design around it?\"\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/76/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/75","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/75/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/75/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/75/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/75","id":27610629,"number":75,"title":"Typo error in \"scene/gui/rich_text_label.cpp\"","user":{"login":"headkase","id":169941,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/169941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/headkase","html_url":"https://github.com/headkase","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/headkase/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/headkase/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/headkase/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/headkase/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/headkase/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/headkase/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/headkase/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/headkase/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/headkase/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-02-14T17:17:04Z","updated_at":"2014-02-14T19:54:38Z","closed_at":"2014-02-14T19:54:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have a typo bug to report.

Don't expect anything big soon, though. Skimming through the code there a lot of questions piling up in the vain of: Why re-invent the standard library (I started to tackle that, as you can see)? Why so much code duplication (and is there a goal to properly factor out copy&pasted code)? Why so little comments? Is there a possibility that the documentation system (I haven't really spent time with it) might be converted to something more standard (e.g. doxygen)? What's with the slightly odd coding style? What's with the tests (e.g. 'bin/godot -test gui' just opens a window, but I don't see automated tests running)? Where's the git (or whatever you used previously) history?\n\nThe forum seems to aim primarily at game devs, and not so much engine hackers. That's fine, but it leaves the impression that the engine is still something of an in-house, throw-over-the-wall-kind-of project.\n\nI'd _love_ to see documentation outlining answers to these kinds of questions (and more) and guidelines for hacking the engine. Also, I think a mailing list would be great.\n\nThanks for the open-sourcing of the engine!
