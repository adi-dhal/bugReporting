change the FPS of an animated script and when I typed in 10 instead of 5 and hit play it didn't change anything.

Now I believe if there is no save button some where that I can press then I expect my setting to be applied right after I type in the value. Having to press Enter wasn't really obvious to me, I thought it was a bug and kept trying to fix it. especially that the value I entered **does not change back** when I leave the screen or click away

Rigidbody2D objects sometimes just spawn in a distance of their actual coords. Also I've noticed that the distance depends on physics_fps value. With high physics fps the distance between a Rigidbody2D appearing on a scene and it's actual coords is larger.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nI tried to reproduce it myself, but the bug appears rarely. I've usually spotted it only with physics_fps value set to 200 and Rigidbody2Ds' gravity scale set to 10.\r\n\r\n**Godot version:** Linux x86_64, Godot 2.1.1 stable","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7301/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7300","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7300/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7300/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7300/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/7300","id":195505469,"number":7300,"title":"Mac (Fat format) export from Windows crashes (error -10825) on startup in Mac","user":{"login":"IBwWG","id":16719964,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/16719964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IBwWG","html_url":"https://github.com/IBwWG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IBwWG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IBwWG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IBwWG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IBwWG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IBwWG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IBwWG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IBwWG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IBwWG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IBwWG/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097162,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/discussion","name":"discussion","color":"ee77ee","default":false},{"id":279097780,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:osx","name":"platform:osx","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":279098255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:porting","name":"topic:porting","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-12-14T11:21:43Z","updated_at":"2016-12-14T16:37:31Z","closed_at":"2016-12-14T15:04:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\r\nexported from win7x64 godot 2.1.1\r\ntrying to launch via itch.io app on Mac OS X 10.10.5\r\n\r\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\r\nOn launch, an error popup says exit code 1.

You would have to copy paste 5-10 lines of code in GDScript, as well as keep track of var names of each texture, my_texture1, my_texture2 and so on. ![](http://i.imgur.com/spb5b0q.png)\r\n\r\nHere is my idea of future implementation:\r\n`export (Array, Texture) var my_texture_array`\r\n\r\nIf we could improve export to take in two arguments, one that tells it that we want to create an export of type Array, and the other to define the type, we would make it a lot more user-friendly and intuitive.\r\n\r\nI am not saying it is not possible to create an array of Textures in the editor. Currently, if you were to write for example:\r\n`export var my_array = Array()`\r\nyou would get an Array in the editor. \r\n...\r\nExcept it is very encumbersome.\r\nYou would have to first set the size of the array (and that is fine, but can also be improved by adding a + button), \r\nThen you would have to set the type; browsing through a long list of types. That can take a minute if you don't know exactly where in the list it is. \r\n\r\nSo if I were to select for example \"Object\", I get a long list I have to look through in order to find \"Texture\". \r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/ockxTi7.png)\r\nI would have to select ImageTexture, since Texture is not on the list. Did not know that, so I probably spend a lot more time trying to find it.\r\nAfter all that, I can select the little arrow on the right in order to open ImageTexture in the inspector. This allows me to load ONE image. Now I have to repeat the same process for every. single. texture.\r\n\r\nSo my thought by adding an \r\n`export(Array, Texture) var my_textures` \r\noption to GDScript, we would not have to select any \"Type\", navigate a long long list, select it and open it up, and only to repeat this nonsense. \r\n\r\nIt would just be there, ready and waiting for you.
