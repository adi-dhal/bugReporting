now, there are some test applications and unit tests in the Godot tools application.  For example:\n\n```\n./godot-tools -test string\n```\n\nThis is great but you have to run each test individually.  In addition, there are tests not even listed in the tools application under the help.  Some of the unit tests are broken and some are more general demo applications.  I think it would be nice to have a separate application built that only runs the unit tests and can run all of them with one call.  This would provide an easier way to write tests and possibly identify problems with Godot's growing codebase.\n\nThere are a wide variety of C++ libraries that handle unit tests.  Some of the more popular ones are:\n- Boost unit tests\n- [cppunit](https://wiki.freedesktop.org/www/Software/cppunit/)\n- [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest)\n- and more...\n\nThe benefit of using a library like this is that they're widely used and can be very powerful.  The downside, is that it's yet another dependency that needs to be installed by developers.\n\nMy proposal would be to use a unit testing library that is a header only.  This would mean it could be included in the Godot source code in the `drivers` folder.  I've been playing with [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch) ([Youtube demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2LcIp56i-8)), a library that has these features and seems to be stable and maintained.  It's licensed under the Boost Software License.\n\nSo, what do people think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2641/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2640","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2640/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2640/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2640/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/2640","id":112283874,"number":2640,"title":"projects in the editor_settings.xml that are no longer found on disk will be removed","user":{"login":"firefly2442","id":531175,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/531175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/firefly2442","html_url":"https://github.com/firefly2442","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/firefly2442/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/firefly2442/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/firefly2442/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/firefly2442/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/firefly2442/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/firefly2442/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/firefly2442/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/firefly2442/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/firefly2442/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-10-20T04:17:45Z","updated_at":"2015-11-19T05:10:55Z","closed_at":"2015-11-18T22:14:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/2640","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/2640","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/2640.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/2640.patch"},"body":"I was getting these errors in the console:\n\n```\nERROR: _load_recent_projects: Condition ' err!=OK ' is true.

in current head(6637a865187422b5b8303231dd43a38a5f5abd51) as well as 1.1\nThe worst crashes are those which don't give any output in developer console, and gdb dont help either since for some errors all he is telling is like \"Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault. 0x000000000044aeb8 in ?? ()\"\n\nAnyway I reproduced one of these errors and it turns out in it's core it's very easy to reproduce:\n1. Just call get_parent().remove_child(self);\n\nSome output in devconsole on why game crashes would be nice. Especially that in real projects it usually will not to be so obvious since it can crash in calls similar to this one (\"root/global\").generateNextLvl(). \n\n**Also not sure if the project should crash in the first place, since I can imagine scenario when some objects might want to remove itself from the tree... Should I edit title/description to take this into account instead of no error in console?**\n\nSome more observations:\nThe crash ocours not in the moment of removing itself from the tree, but when exiting from function call. I mean if generateNextLvl() have 300 lines it don't matter when we remove caller from the tree, crash will always occur when exiting from this function (after line 300 in this case). \n\nSample simple project (really not sure if needed but just in case):\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/168251/godot/some/issues/SelfDeleteCrashWithoutError.7z\n\n**EDIT:**\nBacktrace from the crash from button
