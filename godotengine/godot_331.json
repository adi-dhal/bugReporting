Timer loops a countdown of 10 seconds:\n\nwith:\n\n> child.get_parent().remove_child(child)\n> destination_node.add_child(child)\n> https://gfycat.com/AmpleTotalChanticleer\n\nAs you can see, when the node parent changes, the animation receives the notification exit_tree() and stop the animation, and if autoplay of an animation is on, when the ready notification is received, resets the animation too.\n\nwith:\n\n> child.reparent(destination_node)\n> https://gfycat.com/SmartDeadDoctorfish\n\nWith the reparent, the state from the traveler doesn't change\n\nThe objetive of the reparent method is to move a node from one parent to another, without the loss of state on node or his childrens or the need of patch each children with gdscripts aimed only to change this behaviour, all implemented in a non-destructive way (add_child/remove_child, enter_tree/exit_tree, ready, works as always if you don't reparent)\n\nthe signature of reparent is:\nnode_to_change_parent.reparent(destination_node)\n\nReparent ignores only ready event and give the tools for know when the node is reparenting and take actions on event enter_tree/exit_tree from each type of node, so reparent vs remove_child/add_child method:\n- The reparent only ignores the ready event\n- Now exist a new method for query called \"is_reparenting()\", this one should be queried on enter_tree or exit_tree for skip/change behaviour on problematic nodes who loses his state on reparent.\n- Two new notifications,NOTIFICATION_REPARENTING and NOTIFICATION_REPARENTED, those are called when the reparenting process start and ends, its like an exit/enter tree. This events set the bool of is_reparenting to true and false on node.cpp\n\nFor now we modified/check this node as an example with the enter_tree /exit_tree on reparenting behaviour using the is_reparenting() flag:\nAnimation Player\n\nAlso the demo from video for testing reparenting is added to demos/misc/reparent_tester with many features for debbuging issues and test if some another nodes lose state on reparent or if you want to see the issue on action change this lines:\n![qu20zol 1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12376042/7718312/82597700-fe7c-11e4-9542-4c25b4978ffa.png)\nuncomment the two remove_child/add_child and comment reparent lines on main.gd and viceversa for move with reparent\n\nWe need some Help with the check and implement the behaviour of conserve state on another nodes with the demo, but the core for reparent is finished.\n\nThe behaviour of loss of state described here was a big issue on my shmup, which abuses of move bullets from a local node attached on the ships, to a global one. This with the aim of the burst of bullets follow the coordinates from the ship and when is finished moves to a global node, so the bullets doesn't follow the ship coordinates anymore. Without reparent the animations from the laser show the spawn animation again on mid air, same with timers or other strange behaviour.\nOn the next video is the shmup using reparent for local to global, where all is fixed, look at the behaviour of the laser:\nhttps://gfycat.com/AnchoredMistyCoati\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1948","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1948/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1948/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1948/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/1948","id":78283587,"number":1948,"title":"Dreaming

put here some my ideas of how can 1.2 be (the ideas can be stupid in some way)\n- add icon to .exe (i think time is come)\n- open godot in fullscreen automaticly (or read last session position)\n- tabs to fast scene to scene jumping (i know its in todo-list already)\n- working in code and scene editor (or code and code) in one time (good for wide screens)\n- when typing a path to a node it can be userfull to choose from a visual tree in popup window(for animation callFunc lines at first)\n- reorder nodes just by mouse\n- when creating new node itis toggle (do parent/do child(default)) of selected node\n- hided and scripted icons of nodes will be in static vertical lines to better read\n- in 3d fly mode with mouse look and wasd move\n- preview game in scene editor not in new window, or save window pos\n\nI hope it
