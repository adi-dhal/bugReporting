Java is much more popular than C#, according to [this site](http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe_index?page=index) and job postings, and there are many game developers (especially on Android) who use Java.\n\nAdditionally, many of the features that C# offers compared to Java are not much important if the purpose is scripting, as most scripting in games is imperative and (at worst) object-oriented (and many of the advantages C# offers are related to functional programming, which Java 8 supports decently anyway). Just take a look at your average Unity script, even a more complex one like [this](http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/MeleeWeaponTrail): there's not much there that can't be done in Java straight away!\n\nThe JVM also offers a good amount of other languages - Kotlin, for examples, which has many features like nullable types, pattern matching and operator overloading. There's also Ceylon, which is in many ways a better C# (and compiles directly to JavaScript). Supporting those would not require any more work than adding a JAR dependency. Java also has a larger amount of libraries.\n\nAnd if performance is the main concern and a runtime like the CLR and JVM is too heavy, those can be done away with and C++ could be used directly via LLVM, so that a JIT can be used, avoiding expensive recompilations. This solution is best kept along with GDScript, so that novices (or people who don't need extra performance) can use that instead (and avoid segfaults). The latest standard of C++ has very clean syntax, so I don't think verbosity should be a problem. \n\nC++ is the solution I would like the best, because it would bring the fastest performance (zero overhead, can't be said for any other language), it would not need any extensive changes (as Godot can already be used from C++, and is written in C++ itself), it would have the more consistent support across platforms and it would make it possible to use Godot for very large projects (such as AAA games - there's a reason most studios use Unreal and not Unity). Additionally, keeping GDScript would let those people who don't need extra performance an easier way to write scripts than Java or C# (both very verbose languages) would be.\n\n**tl;dr:** I think C++ (or worse, Java 8) makes a better choice than C# for scripting in Godot.\n\nAny opinions?\n\nEdit: I see the \"feature proposal\" tag (which is correct) but I want to make it clear that **I'm not proposing C# support in Godot**, I'm merely reporting and commenting on some of the things I've heard around.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5081/reactions","total_count":23,"+1":11,"-1":10,"laugh":2,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5080","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5080/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5080/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5080/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5080","id":158852321,"number":5080,"title":"ignore

If this PR gets merged, I can update the docs.\n\n**Overall note: All this proposal is based on the assumption that the Android build is only used for generating the export templates as reliably as possible. Moreover, I believe that makes the Android build handier. If in some future tools-enabled Android builds were needed because of a widespread desire of using Godot under Android netbooks or so, some things would need to be changed.**\n## Android/build component versions\n- Upgrade Android plugin for Gradle to 2.1.0\n- Downgrade NDK platform to 14 to match minSdkVersion.\n## Smarter build and packaging of the Godot export template\n### SCons phase\n\nWhen the SCons phase of the Android build is done the generated .so file is moved to the directory relevant for the Gradle phase to pick it for the combination of arch and build type (release or debug). For instance, `platform/android/java/libs/debug/armeabi-v7a`.\n\nMoving is performed instead of copying or symlinking to avoid polluting the `bin` directory with intermediate files, because the final binaries for Android are the APKs. The only scenario (and is a theoretical one) in which the .`so` would be kept at `bin` is that of building for an arch unknown to Android. And in that case, the SCons script would print a warning message.\n\nNotes:\n- ARMv7 both with or without NEON will be copied to the same `armeabi-v7a` dir (the newest wins).\n- Both _debug_ and _debug_release_ targets will get copied to the same `debug` dir (the newest wins). Release is unambiguous.\n### Gradle phase\n\nBecause of all that is done at the SCons level, Gradle will be able to generate both debug and release APKs containing libraries for x86, ARMv6 and/or ARMv7. In the case of the debug APK it can contain the handy release_debug or a full debug build if needed.\n\nFurthermore, Gradle will generate the export template APKs with their correct naming (`android_debug.apk` and `android_release.apk`) and at the correct location at the top-level `bin` directory.\n\nAlso the Gradle script disables explicitly singing and zip-aligning of the APKs to save time since those operations must be done at export time then the final game APK is generated.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5077/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":1}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4767","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"C51B:572B:CFF610:1B790CA:59D69D46","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=227>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=225>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"a2da1c7131da7943d6b731f597fc7628\"","status":"200 OK"}}
