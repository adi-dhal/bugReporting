In our game we use couple of hacks to bypass that limitation but they create another problems and are generally troublesome. \nWhy I think there should be this possibility? Because it's easier to do hierarchical objects structure thanks to this, (just like in object oriented programming, but with scenes). **Maybe I will give real life example here.**\n\nLet's say we will have enemies in our game, quite a lot of them most of them very similar to each other. We could create one scene \"BaseEnemy\" write a script there, add a lot of inner nodes that are needed for this code to work and setup nice amount of export variables (thanks to them we will be able to modify individual enemies behaviour):\n![baseenemy](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6129594/9976058/4cb2e910-5ed5-11e5-9918-d482628fa555.png)\n_A base enemy scene_\n\nThen for each concrete enemy we cloud just simply load BaseEnemy as root node, setup exported values of Enemy and decorate it with additional specific nodes that are needed like model asset, or additional weapon. \n![concreteenemy](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6129594/9976059/516670c6-5ed5-11e5-9250-903b202b4499.png)\n_A concrete enemy scene_\n\nNow when we need to change some shared node/logic of our enemy in some way, we don't need to update 10 files separately, we only need to update that single \"BaseEnemy.xscn\" one :) \n\nI think that this simple feature would make life of at least some of us a lot easier :) What do you think? \n(Off course I mean \"simple\" from user side, not sure if this feature would not force another scene format change, but hey! They have changed already between current and 1.1 so it could be good time for this

trying to use the CanvasItem.draw\\* methods to render a mask into a render target viewport. I need to draw textures on the mask using different transforms for each texture. draw_set_transform() says:\n\n_Set a custom transform for drawing. Anything drawn afterwards will be transformed by this._\n\nI interpret that to mean anything drawn _before_ draw_set_transform() would not have the transform applied (or would use whatever was last passed to a draw_set_transform() call).  However the behavior I see in 1.1stable is that everything in the _draw() call is rendered using the transform. My draw method code:\n\n```\nfunc _draw():\n    draw_circle(Vector2(100,100), 30, Color(1, 0, 0))\n    # BUG??? this causes the circle to be transformed as well.  Uncommenting the last line\n    # causes no transformation to the texture or circle.\n    draw_set_transform(Vector2(50,10), 0, Vector2(1,1))\n    draw_texture(texture, Vector2(10,10))\n#   draw_set_transform(Vector2(10,50), 0, Vector2(1,1)) \n```\n\nBoth the circle and the texture are drawn with the draw_set_transform() applied. Similarly, if I uncomment the last line, neither the circle or texture are placed using the first draw_set_transform() applied. It behaves as though whatever was last passed to draw_set_transform() is used for all the draw_\\* calls.\n\nWith both transform calls commented out (the drawn texture is the Documentation text box):\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4614207/9944446/5e4075ac-5d55-11e5-80d4-bc59fed684b0.png)\n\nWith just the first transform call uncommented:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4614207/9944459/790ba51e-5d55-11e5-814b-117f3a2b08fc.png)\n\nWith both calls uncommented:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4614207/9944472/898d86aa-5d55-11e5-97da-9984604ac8a8.png)\n\nIs this expected behavior???    If so the doc should be clarified.  Is there any other way to _individually_ orient the textures I want to draw with draw_texture?  \n\nI can send a small project that replicates the problem but here is most of it:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4614207/9944504/b520eaf0-5d55-11e5-839b-a532e112f052.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2487/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2486","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2486/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2486/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2486/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2486","id":106949832,"number":2486,"title":"Building

Now script imports all bones being useful or not,\nwhich leads to messed-up bone system if complicated rigs are used with many mechanism bones\n(quite common case with Blender if Rigify is used or
