However, with all new fancy stuff like Virtual Reality headsets and 4K monitors etc. I was thinking that one problem encountered is the display quality of text. Then I remembered a project that I found 2 years ago, GLyphy: https://github.com/behdad/glyphy\r\n\r\nSee this video if you want to know more about how GLyphy works:\r\nhttp://vimeo.com/behdad/glyphy\r\n\r\nMost other projects sample the SDF into a texture. This has all the usual problems that sampling has. Ie. it distorts the outline and is low quality. GLyphy instead represents the SDF using actual vectors submitted to the GPU. This results in very high quality rendering, though at a much higher runtime cost.\r\n\r\nI do not see why godot should remove the bitmap based font system (it has less runtime costs and works well) but a vector based SDF (GLyphy) could complement this for projects that need better display quality of text.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7805","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7805/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7805/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7805/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7805","id":207410302,"number":7805,"title":"Various fixes for TabContainer. also Fix issue #7752 ... v3","user":{"login":"RebelliousX","id":1888186,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1888186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX","html_url":"https://github.com/RebelliousX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false},{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-02-14T03:45:57Z","updated_at":"2017-03-01T17:39:12Z","closed_at":"2017-03-01T17:35:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/7805","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7805","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7805.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7805.patch"},"body":"- Renamed `tab_changed` signal to `tab_selected`.

is an ongoing idea that I am building on, and I believe this have the potential to simplify collision layers and masks - for intermediate and beginners alike. \r\n\r\nWhile I was working on a tutorial explaining Collision Layers and Masks thoroughly, I realize that a lot of the work consists of having to manage and setting up the individual collision layers and masks.\r\n\r\nWhile I realize we have a \"Groups\" tab that allows us to set groups, it does not directly affect collision layers and masks without going into gdscript of each object and managing collisions from there. \r\nYou could argue that you could check which group \"I am on\" and set layers and masks from code - and I am sure that would work, but that is not simple or effective - at least not compared to this possible solution.\r\n\r\nFor example, when working with layers and masks I usually plan ahead of what types of objects will be in which layers and interact with which masks. This is an example of my note:\r\n\r\n**Collision Layers | Masks**\r\n1 - Static Objects (immovable objects, floor, roof, etc.) <-> 2, 3, 4\r\n2 - Friendly Rigid Bodies (crates, player, etc.) <-> 1, 2, 3, 5\r\n3 - Enemy Rigid Bodies <-> 1, 2, 4\r\n4 - Player Bullets  <-> 1, 3\r\n5 - Enemy Bullets <-> 1, 2\r\n\r\nI realize that keeping this consistent can be incredibly awkward. Having to go back to my list every time I create new objects. \r\nAfter all, for **every**, **single**, **object** I make; I would have to go into the inspector and manually set individual layers and masks.\r\n\r\nSo this idea hit me; Why not create a \"Collision Group\" system, that allows us to setup individual collision groups for those masks and layers? \r\n\r\nImagine having an simple drop down menu in place of Collision Layers and Masks that allows you to set a new Group or choose an existing group. \r\nWhen creating a new group, you set a name for it and select which layer it is on and what it with collide with (masks). \r\n**Some of the best advantages with this,** is that if you later decide that all static objects should also collide with objects on layer 6, you just edit the group instead of doing inside every single object and manually adding 6 to them.\r\n\r\nGroup name: \"Static Objects\" <---- This is what you set on new objects that are static\r\nLayer: 1\r\nMask: 2,3,4\r\n\r\nGroup name: \"Friendly Rigid Bodies\" <---- Easy setup of friendly rigidbodies such as player, crates, etc.\r\nLayer: 2\r\nMask: 1,2,3,5\r\n\r\n_Lastly I should add_; you should not be forced to setup a group - you should still be able to just directly set layers and masks without defining a group.\r\n\r\nThoughts? Feelings? Any flaws that I have not foreseen about this?

far as I understand, level of detail (LoD) in Godot is currently achieved by using an existing feature named `draw range` in GeometryInstance, and having multiple instances of the same object at different ranges.\r\n\r\nThis is fine for local objects, but it becomes nasty when it comes to lodding a terrain, or a forest (anything not \"local\" or numerous).\r\nHeightmaps or voxel geometry for example require to be split in chunks, and splits are bigger or smaller depending on their LoD level. In addition to that, their boundaries have to be recalculated with different geometry everytime the LoD is changing, and this for every viewport in the same World. It's still involves turning meshes on and off, somehow, but relying only on just `draw range` is impossible, it would need some more custom logic.\r\n\r\nAdvanced lodding techniques involve collapsing vertices gradually, which is also completely different from `draw range`. And in case Godot won't support this natively, there should be room in the API to be able to implement it as a module.\r\n\r\nSo the proposal here is as the title says: it would be great if 3.0 had the API possibility of having custom lodding that is not only based on a fixed draw range algorithm (could also be related to https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6375 which is about hysteresis)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7786/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7785","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7785/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7785/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7785/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7785","id":207021357,"number":7785,"title":"Various fixes for TabContainer. also Fix issue #7752 ... v2.1","user":{"login":"RebelliousX","id":1888186,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1888186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX","html_url":"https://github.com/RebelliousX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false},{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-02-12T01:26:24Z","updated_at":"2017-03-02T22:54:24Z","closed_at":"2017-03-02T22:37:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/7785","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7785","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7785.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7785.patch"},"body":"- Renamed `tab_changed` signal to `tab_selected`.

It also adds a few methods to the camera object to set the correct values for stereo projection.\r\n\r\nThe frustum is set at unit depth, not at the near plane, so you can change the near and far plane without having to adjust the frustum.

I know a few people who are currently doing HMD development still in Godot 2 and as i'm about to fix 7121 for Godot 3 I figured submitting this on the 2.1 branch could be appreciated (not to mention I'm still using it for my OpenVR project :))\r\n\r\nAll this PR does is introduce a new camera mode called FRUSTUM which allows you to set a left/right/top/bottom frustum from which the projection matrix is calculated. It also adds a few methods to the camera object to set the correct values for stereo projection.\r\n\r\nThe frustum is set at unit depth, not at the near plane, so you can change the near and far plane without having to adjust the frustum. Also the frustum will be adjusted to the aspect ratio of the viewport by Godot itself so do not adjust the top/bottom of the frustum by aspect ratio, instead set up the frustum assuming a square screen.
