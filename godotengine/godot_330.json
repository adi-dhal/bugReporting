However, if you provide the contact index as the parameter, the game crashes.\nI made a minimal example showing this crash here: https://github.com/Zamaroht/crash_example\n\nAfter speaking with romulox_x on IRC, he found out that the parameter this method actually takes is the number returned by get_contact_collider_shape(). However, by using that number the game doesn't crash, but it doesn't return anything.\n\nSince get_collider_metadata() returns the tile position of a Tilemap in KinematicBody2D, I'd expect get_contact_collider_shape_metadata() to return this same data.\n\nIs it actually a bug or am I missing something?

So it would be nice to hear some advices or ways of improvement of this patch.\nTo do this task I made a copy of existing gradient editor from shader graph editor and do some modifications to it (I decided to try replace original one with modified version later). \nSo what was done:\n-new resource for color ramp  + editor\n-backward compatibility. Old coloring for particles 2d will be converted to color ramp (or to new color property if only one color phase was used before).\n-undo/redo support.\n![colorramp](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10543859/7789160/db0fa4f0-025f-11e5-9d3d-472ba1bc2898.png)\n![particlecolorramp](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10543859/7789161/e08fb51e-025f-11e5-92f2-c8c9ec00f376.gif)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1973/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1972","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1972/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1972/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1972/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/1972","id":80231758,"number":1972,"title":"Setting build vs properties in scons.","user":{"login":"PeaceSells50","id":12586944,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/12586944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeaceSells50","html_url":"https://github.com/PeaceSells50","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeaceSells50/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeaceSells50/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeaceSells50/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeaceSells50/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeaceSells50/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeaceSells50/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeaceSells50/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeaceSells50/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeaceSells50/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-05-24T18:25:37Z","updated_at":"2015-06-23T03:01:28Z","closed_at":"2015-06-23T03:01:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/1972","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/1972","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/1972.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/1972.patch"},"body":"This sets up the nmake build properties in visual studio.
