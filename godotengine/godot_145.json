On the client that calls the RPC function, the RPC function gets called and has a valid pointer to the objects. On the other client, I get null pointers.\r\n\r\nI have debugged the instance_id for these objects and noticed they are different on the two clients. I assume this instance id is meant to be the same on both clients in order for a correct reference to be obtained. These objects I am referencing are just objects in the level.\r\n\r\nI've printed out the instances id's of all game objects to debug this and notice that there is an issue as soon as my level has loaded.\r\n\r\nif you diff these two files:\r\n[log.txt](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/706509/log.txt)\r\n[log_nix.txt](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/706510/log_nix.txt)\r\n\r\non file is the client (log_nix.txt) the other is the server log (log.txt)\r\n\r\nyou will see the id's go out of sync at:\r\n\r\nLinux: World - ID: 950\r\nWindows: World - ID: 952\r\n\r\nI suspect this is the problem.\r\n\r\nIf a client does not connect, my windows machine ID is around 948, so when the client connects this is when the id's are going out of sync. I suspect the server makes some game objects that are discarded at this point.\r\nEven if this is the case, a typical game might make different objects throwing instance id's out of sync even before the client connects.\r\n\r\nThere looks like there needs to be a special synchronization of instance id's.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7535/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7534","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7534/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7534/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7534/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7534","id":200859346,"number":7534,"title":".gitignore: Added VC++ cache database and temporary storage folder when debugging","user":{"login":"RayKoopa","id":9631152,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/9631152?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa","html_url":"https://github.com/RayKoopa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":205417413,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:windows","name":"platform:windows","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279098009,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:buildsystem","name":"topic:buildsystem","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-01-15T09:52:27Z","updated_at":"2017-01-15T09:58:13Z","closed_at":"2017-01-15T09:58:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/7534","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7534","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7534.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7534.patch"},"body":"I added a cache file and directory steadily occuring for me when using VS2015:\r\n\r\n- `*.VC.opendb`: Gets created when the solution is opened and has the format `$(SolutionName).VC.opendb`.

I unfortunately do not have access to Android.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, it would be good to create one or two demo projects both to include in the Godot demos and to test this functionality to ensure it works consistently.\r\n\r\nI do have an early prototype using this functionality to control the camera for a little Cardboard VR game but there are a few other simple concepts that would be good to demo such as maybe a compass or the basis or an AR type game (I hope to look into capturing camera input soon).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7531/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7530","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7530/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7530/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7530/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/7530","id":200840157,"number":7530,"title":"A repeating Timer accumulates a precision error over time.","user":{"login":"CowThing","id":11450875,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11450875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CowThing","html_url":"https://github.com/CowThing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CowThing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CowThing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CowThing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CowThing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CowThing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CowThing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CowThing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CowThing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CowThing/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279537176,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/hacktoberfest","name":"hacktoberfest","color":"00eeee","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-01-15T00:56:09Z","updated_at":"2017-04-03T22:22:52Z","closed_at":"2017-04-03T22:22:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\r\nWindows 10 64bit - Godot 2.2 alpha\r\n\r\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\r\nA repeating Timer will take longer than expected to execute x number of times.

is a helper method to join paths. It's similar to Python's `os.path.join`. However, unlike the latter, `plus_file` can add a root to the path if the first string is empty, e.g:\r\n\r\n``` GDScript\r\n# Python\r\nos.path.join(\"\", \"file\") # Returns \"file\"\r\n# GDScript\r\n\"\".plus_file(\"file\") # Returns \"/file\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis shouldn't be the correct behaviour. It forces you to add lot of `if str.empty()` conditions to avoid bugs when working with relative paths.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that. Now the user has to explicitly specify if he wants an absolute path:\r\n\r\n``` GDScript\r\n# Python\r\nos.path.join(\"\", \"file\") # Returns \"file\"\r\nos.path.join(os.sep, \"file\") # Returns \"/file\"\r\n# GDScript\r\n\"\".plus_file(\"file\") # Returns \"file\"\r\n\"/\".plus_file(\"file\") # Returns \"/file\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso this PR fixes possible duplicated separators:\r\n\r\n``` GDScript\r\n\"whatever\".plus_file(\"/usr\").plus_file(\"bin\")\r\n# Before\r\n\"whatever//usr/bin\"\r\n# After\r\n\"whatever/usr/bin\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is still a difference with `os.path.join` here though:\r\n\r\n``` GDScript\r\nos.path.join(\"whatever\", \"/usr\", \"bin\") # Returns \"/usr/bin\"\r\n\"whatever\".plus_file(\"/usr\").plus_file(\"bin\") # Returns \"whatever/usr/bin\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I don't really agree with `os.path.join` here anyway and we don't have to use exactly the same, so...\r\n\r\nWDYT?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7525/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7524","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7524/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7524/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7524/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7524","id":200812543,"number":7524,"title":"Directory:

It could be renamed to Input.get_last_mouse_speed() or similar.\r\n- [x] Tween.set_speed() is confusing as it returns a scale, could be renamed to set_speed_scale() (#2060) Same with the property (#6935).\r\n- [x] OS.get_ticks_msec() => should be named get_time_msec(), the name makes it hard to find it (it was for me) because no one would search for tick to get the current ms-precise time. (@Zylann)\r\n- [x] Why File.get/store_***(content) instead of File.read/write_***(content) as any other I/O API? (@Zylann)\r\n- [x] Vector2::get_aspect should probably become Vector2::aspect, since none of the other methods in the class have the get_ prefix. (@bojidar-bg)\r\n- [x] set_send_address should be set_destination_address. When I first saw this function I thought I will be able to set packet origin IP/Port (so I can later listen on that port - I'm trying to do UDP hole punching). Sadly it's something different. (@Marqin)\r\n- [x] rotation setters and getters must be standarized:, currently there are many variations like: set_rot, set_rotation, set_rotation_deg, set_rotationd, set_rotd (@djrm)\r\n- [x] In String we have `get_base_dir()` `get_file()`. Why not the same with `basename() -> get_basename()` `extension() -> get_extension()` (@AlexHolly)\r\n- [x] set_enable_monitoring( bool enable ) to set_monitoring( bool enable ) (@jtaart)\r\n- [x] Rename `rang_range` to `randi_range` and add `randf_range`, to match `randi` and `randf` (#6235)\r\n\r\n## Functions to change\r\n\r\n- [x] DirAccess::list_dir_begin should return Error like other functions of this kind.\r\n- [x] SceneTree.call_group() (and notify_group()) requires flags as the first argument, which pretty much just results in many zeros in the code, I'd suggest an alternative call_group_flags() or something to mitigate this, and remove the flags argument from call_group(). (@WalasPrime)\r\n\r\n## Functions to remove\r\n\r\n- [x] OS.set_video_mode() (https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/3778#issuecomment-233447010).\r\n- [x] OS.get_fullscreen_mode_list() (https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4624#issuecomment-218515473).\r\n\r\n## Properties to remove\r\n\r\n- [x] Expand from TextureFrame. The Strech Mode property is much more flexible and can do some things that already override the Expand settings.\r\n\r\n## Bug\r\n\r\n- [x] Many nodes override inherited methods, which makes the said methods uncallable from GDScript.\r\nHere is a small list: Viewport::get_viewport, CanvasItem::get_viewport, EditorPlugin::get_name (@bojidar-bg)\r\n\r\n## Refactoring\r\n\r\n- [x] Add proper support for static methods like `File.file_exists()` instead of `File.new().file_exists()`\r\n\r\n## Things to move\r\n\r\n#### Constants in global scope that could be namespaced\r\n\r\nSome constants have redundant naming, for example in VisibilityEnabler2D, all identifiers have the ENABLER_ prefix, but it seem useless since they already are scoped in the class.\r\nOn the opposite side, there are a lot of consts that are outside of any class, and it can be confusing. For example, the first time I looked for button codes I was trying to get them from Input, or InputEvent, to no avail. So I eventually used the raw numbers, to finally find they are in global scope like KEY_A or BUTTON_LEFT.

When you have an Area2D and another Area2D or a PhysicsBody overlapping and set that they report collisions to each other, and you remove the Area2D from the tree (with `remove_child()`), you get errors like \r\n\r\n> ERROR: _body_inout: Condition ' !body_in && !E ' is true ...\r\nor\r\n> ERROR: _body_inout: Condition ' !area_in && !E ' is true ...\r\n\r\n`call_deferred(\"remove_child\", child)` does NOT work here. It seems that they try to report another collider leaving the area although they are already removed from the scene. \r\nThe only ways for me to fix that were to use `set_monitoring_enabled()` in `_enter_tree` and `_exit_tree` or set them to different layers/masks (which is not a solution, they have to collide for gameplay reasons).\r\nI already made a fix for that, using the monitoring solution from above (which I will make a pull request for as soon as the second problem is solved).\r\n\r\n2. When having multiple overlapping  Area2Ds (and optionally PhysicsBodies) as children of one parent node in the scene, removing this parent node from the scene with `remove_child()` without freeing it and readding it after that will cause errors:\r\n\r\n> Condition ' !E ' is true\r\nand in some cases also \r\n\r\n> Signal enter/exit_tree already connected to given method _area_enter_tree in that object.\r\n\r\nAll of those are thrown in area_2d.cpp when re-adding the Area2ds to the scene. So for some reason the connections aren't removed when removing the parent node is removed. But I'm still trying to figure out what causes the first error. And what is even weirder, if you make the Area2D's not overlap anymore after the errors have been thrown and you redo the whole thing, more errors are thrown although they should not be reporting collisiosn to each other anymore. \r\n`call_deferred()` doesn't work here either.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to fix this right now, if anyone has any hints regarding that, that would be helpful.\r\nNone of those problems occur if you just `queue_free() ` them and reinstance them, but I like to keep my player object and my levels (that are just instanced children of a parent world node whichs has the UI and stuff) instanced when switching them, so they are in the same state as before when they get reloaded into the world. \r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n1. bug: Make two or more Area2Ds, let them overlap. Remove one of them using remove_child()\r\n2. bug: Make two or more Area2Ds as children of a parent node, let them overlap. Remove and re-add the parent node with a script (this will likely also cause the 1. bug)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7507/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4848","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"8EDC:01FB:116FC97:24FC5CC:59D69BF6","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=146>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=144>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"cd7c6d8afa897c408d0a16b4e30182dd\"","status":"200 OK"}}
