The Sprite nodes in front of it were not displayed.\n\nHere's a more recent example:\n\nThe level has a tilemap, some sprites and a Polygon2D as the cave background. This is my level on editor:\n![1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6296184/12219055/3873eed8-b711-11e5-9783-af5ef83d665d.png)\n\nAnd this is the level running on desktop:\n![2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6296184/12219057/4a246478-b711-11e5-804c-0579d91e1255.png)\n\nThen, I run the game on my ST21a and this is the result:\n![3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6296184/12219059/5b9ca24c-b711-11e5-8c49-aead97b67a67.png)\n\nAs you can see the tiles are pixelated. At first I tried disabling the mipmaping and see if that helped, but no. Then I remembered the issue I'm describing with the Polygon2D node. So I removed the node from the scene tree and this is the result:\n![4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6296184/12219066/b755e2e2-b711-11e5-9300-716afb04cdbc.png)\n\nAs you can see now the mipmap is working right and all the sprites are displayed correctly.\n\nThe device info:\n![datos](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6296184/12219097/5b8976b6-b713-11e5-8722-7ac1f3e8b76d.png)\n\nOn more recent devices the game looks fine. I don't know what might be causing this bugs. Maybe there's a memory/texture pointers limit that's being overflowed? \nHere's also a hint: the issue is fixed if the polygon is assigned with a texture.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3298/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3297","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3297/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3297/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3297/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3297","id":125787129,"number":3297,"title":"comment

However I didn't find any META-INF.\n\nIn fact, this problem is probably caused by a bunch of export.cpp errors.\nWhenever I try to export to Android, the program outputs these:\n- platform/android/export/export.cpp:854 - Screen res name in a resource, should be plaintext\n  [4 times]\n\nand then\n- platform/android/export/export.cpp:799 - Application name in a resource, should be plaintext (but you can ignore this).\n- platform/android/export/export.cpp:810 - Activity name in a resource, should be plaintext (but you can ignore this)\n\nI tried it on a almost plain project of mine and on the \"Area 2D input events\" demo project.\n\nSo, am I missing somthing?\nI'm using Ubuntu Studio 14.04, tried both Godot 1.1 and the last Alpha of 2.0 (the errors are the same)\nUsing

If they're left as `Vector2`s when we do calculations on them, like adding/subtracting to get adjacent cells, the floating-point math [could introduce small error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point#Accuracy_problems), and using the `Vector2` variable in certain ways will create bugs:\n- As keys in a Dictionary, since the hashes will be different and `==` will return false\n- Cast back to `int`s for the other TileMap functions, since the fractional part gets truncated, not rounded (example in GDScript: `int(1.9999999)` returns 1, not 2.)\n\nI'm avoiding the issue by converting the coordinates to Arrays `[int(vector.x), int(vector.y)]` before using them in my pathfinding/line-of-sight functions or the Dictionary where I keep extra map info. But it'd be more convenient and efficient to have an integer vector struct that works like `Vector2`, so I made a branch implementing the existing `Point2i` type from [math_2d.h](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/core/math/math_2d.h#L369) into GDScript, Variant, the resource formats, and those TileMap functions: https://github.com/sheepandshepherd/godot/tree/point2i\nAnd a scene testing that the new type, operators, saving/loading, etc all work correctly: https://github.com/sheepandshepherd/godot-point2i-test\n\nAre these integer vector types something we'd want to add to Godot? If so, I can finish adding Point2iArray and Point3i types, then make a pull request. Or otherwise, I don't mind just sticking with IntArrays, which are a simpler solution to the problem; might not warrant adding new types to GDScript.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3286/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3285","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3285/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3285/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3285/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/3285","id":125726547,"number":3285,"title":"android template compile error with module","user":{"login":"volzhs","id":8281454,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8281454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/volzhs","html_url":"https://github.com/volzhs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volzhs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volzhs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volzhs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volzhs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volzhs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volzhs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volzhs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volzhs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volzhs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097562,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:android","name":"platform:android","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279098009,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:buildsystem","name":"topic:buildsystem","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-01-09T01:06:27Z","updated_at":"2016-01-11T10:45:17Z","closed_at":"2016-01-09T17:04:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I tried to compile with android module (https://github.com/punto-/godot_modules/tree/master/admob)\n\nerror logs\n\n```\nGodot Android!!!!!
