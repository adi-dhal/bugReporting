Nvidia TwinView and other\ndrivers use the Xinerama protocol so this should be compatible with\nmost multi-screen setups.\n\nThis forces fullscreen to always go to screen 0.

I am familiar with Godot from first week of its birth (spring 2014). \nLooking at a demo I started replenishing gradually the project models. Everything went rather well. \nOh well! prehistory will be enough!\nHere to you directly list:\n\n**To add:**\n1. The script of your car can gather fighter speeds, but for some reason can't go back. At me (for my purposes) everything was solved very simply. I wouldn't want that other people got on so low-quality demo. If you not against, I can make the new version of a demo of the car.\n\n**Bugs:**\n1. Where without bugs. We will begin with the most ancient and long ago moss-grown. Tremesh collider still doesn't work. To what it is connected I don't know. If I would know at the time of prerelease 1.0stable that this bug lives still, I not simply would write here, but also on mail and to personal messages in facebook. For example my route perfectly works with a similar collision, but it is impossible to use it on the car.\n2. One more old bug (itself I came across it and even I wrote about it is mute at a forum). Convex collider very strongly loads system if to deliver it child to the car. In case of collisions my notebook starts being buggy very strongly. Also I ask to correct. Of course I don't give a demo, but I think you and you will be able to check it.\n\n**To correct:**\n1. I stayed some months on Unity3D and returned back to Godot only because I was enticed by physics of the car. Today I stayed the whole day behind the project and the working prototype of behavior of the car tried to make. I almost managed it. The first that to me was evident it twitching of a wheel (as in the same Unity), but also sharp response of the car to all these actions isn't simple.\n2. And again physics of the car. It not especially hinders, but the realism and ideas of friction kills at all. If to go on the car along a wall, the car sharp breakthrough turns approximately on 10-15 degrees to the opposite side from a wall. I Predlogat also to reconsider this slice of a code of physics.\n3. Third point and... (what?) Of course I will speak again about a car physics nedodelannost. In settings of a wheel there are ticks which are responsible for characteristics of a wheel (turn and pull). My car falls to the ground and jumps up on back wheels (it normally. settings such) but if to click gas, the machine will go., It seems, anything surprising as the machine concerns back wheels of the earth. All problem that on back wheels the tick \"pull\" isn't necessary... Having a little thought I came to a conclusion that the car receives force not on wheels, and on a cabin. I would like to see impact of physics on wheels.\n4. \"Fig. One more point. Likely again about car physics!\". Absolutely truly! Again point about dirty linen! It could be carried in the section \"Add\", but it is rather a defect which can't be corrected without correction of point 3. The essence of this \"bug feature\" is that the car, crashing into a hindrance doesn't go any more and wheels aren't twisted soovetstvenno. Everything is seemingly normal, on as opportunities \"To burn down tires\", \"to start with a place, reserving a trace\"? all this can be made, but what sense if the wheel isn't twisted?\n\n**Inference:**\nI bring the apologies for inexact names. The text is translated by means of the site as I very badly know English.\nIt would be desirable to hear your judgement and a sentence concerning a car demo.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1488","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1488/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1488/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1488/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/1488","id":60251121,"number":1488,"title":"pass giving ; or <NewLine> required errors at end of file","user":{"login":"WatIsDeze","id":10252874,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10252874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WatIsDeze","html_url":"https://github.com/WatIsDeze","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WatIsDeze/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WatIsDeze/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WatIsDeze/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WatIsDeze/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WatIsDeze/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WatIsDeze/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WatIsDeze/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WatIsDeze/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WatIsDeze/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2015-03-08T10:39:18Z","updated_at":"2015-04-26T23:29:51Z","closed_at":"2015-04-26T23:29:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When putting the following code in a script, at the end of a file without an empty newline give the following parser error:\n\nerror(line, 1)Expected ';' or <NewLine>.\n\n```\nfunc _do_something():\n    pass\n```\n\nReplacing the pass with a return, or adding a new line after pass solved the problem.
