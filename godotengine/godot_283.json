change trims the web export page.\n## Changes\n- Minimum size is canvas size, so no scrollbars as long as the game fits, e.g. for `iframe`\n- Controls as overlay, hidden until hover\n  - Can be disabled completely\n- Status display as overlay\n  - Hides on click (for emergency, in case status freezes...)\n- Output only visible in debug export\n  - Visibility can be toggled per controls\n- Godot default theme style\n- Should be HTML/XML polyglot (but hard to verify)\n- Separate Emscripten interface `Module` logic from page `Presentation` logic\n- Add export options to customize page:\n  - Page title (`<title>`)\n  - `<head>` include\n  - Fonts (`font-family`)\n  - CSS include\n  - Controls visibility\n- Prevent exception when clicking fullscreen button before fully loaded\n- Fix canvas being smaller than game\n- Fix iframed page not regaining focus on click\n## Demonstration\n\n![web-export-options](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6996191/12439577/46cc9182-bf32-11e5-9130-41a3a71c63fa.png)\n_These settings are also used for the following demonstrations._\n- Debug export:\n  https://googledrive.com/host/0B1lsc05JnCtrSUtiT25pRVdTR1k\n- Release export, controls disabled, in `iframe`:\n  https://googledrive.com/host/0B1lsc05JnCtrVXdCNWh4TTRXaVE\n\nCloses #2774\n## To do later:\n- Implement canvas resize\n  - Substract output height when visible\n- Implement fullscreen button properly\n- Implement cursor lock toggle\n- Less ridiculous vertical centering for status display\n- Handle `webglcontextlost` event\n- Style checkboxes — Hacky, would have to include \"check\" texture\n- Spinner? — Seems annoying to me, maybe a loading bar when `setStatus` cooperates\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3391/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3390","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3390/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3390/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3390/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3390","id":127561926,"number":3390,"title":"duplicate
