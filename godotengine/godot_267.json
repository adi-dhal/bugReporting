is a feature request for RichTextLabel. Currently, RichTextLabel only offers to set/get the number of visible characters, but it does not offer how many lines are visible. As far as I see, this is not possible to calculate in GDScript when the font is a not a fixed-width one.\n### Context:\n\nThe way RichTextLabel handles long texts (scrollbars) is useful when building desktop-like GUIs, but many games (Visual Novels, JRPGs) don't work that way.\n\nI'm trying to implement a text box for dialogue. Typically, a a text box has a fixed width and fixed number of lines visible, so a long text that doesn't fit into the text box is broken into parts (each part contains only enough characters to fill the textbox), and the next part is not shown until the user presses a button.\n\nI essentially need to implement something along the lines of [this](https://github.com/henriquelalves/GodotTIE), but I need to use RichTextLabel for italics and bold, and the font isn't a fixed width one.

(optional) You can play with live editing and moving camera around.\n\nManual way:\n1. Prepare gridmap setup (mesh library + big gridmap lvl)\n2. Add camera and omni light (the best setup would be ideal topdown so you could exactly see light boundaries and what's rendered on the screen)\n3. Note normal number of draw calls.\n4.
