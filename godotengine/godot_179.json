However, in the example linked below, I'm using move_and_slide() and I'm also manually clamping the velocity values, and this problem still persists.\n\nThe problem happens more frequently with more objects, but I've had it happen in my own game project with as little as 5-6 objects, and it will drag the framerate down to single digits when it happens.\n\nIf there's enough objects, like in the example, once the problem occurs it doesn't seem to go away. If you have fewer objects (say less than 20), then the problem takes longer to appear but also goes away after a few seconds, as seen in the graph below.  \n\nHere's what the profile graph looks like:\n\n![profile1](https://i.imgur.com/CBDSyXZ.png)\n\nand as you can see, when the usage spikes the fixed process count goes from 33 to 264 (when I had 33 objects)\n\n![profile2](https://i.imgur.com/cUpgfgP.png)\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nDownload the example linked below, run the profiler and then run the scene. The more objects there are, the quicker the problem appears.

So you can actually tell that the viewport scale is equal to the number of pixels a \"game pixel\" takes on screen.\n\nI could investigate of a way to do this as a plugin, but I wonder if this can actually make it in the engine.\n\nWDYT?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6506/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6505","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6505/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6505/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6505/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6505","id":177241358,"number":6505,"title":"Duplicate Search menu in script editor","user":{"login":"gau-veldt","id":1862162,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1862162?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gau-veldt","html_url":"https://github.com/gau-veldt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gau-veldt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gau-veldt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gau-veldt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gau-veldt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gau-veldt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gau-veldt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gau-veldt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gau-veldt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gau-veldt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279537176,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/hacktoberfest","name":"hacktoberfest","color":"00eeee","default":false},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/6","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/6/labels","id":1807486,"number":6,"title":"2.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":263,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-06-03T16:13:32Z","updated_at":"2017-09-18T11:53:44Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2017-09-18T11:53:44Z"},"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-09-15T17:46:44Z","updated_at":"2016-10-30T15:34:12Z","closed_at":"2016-10-30T15:34:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\nx11 Godot 2.2a dc6eefdbf2b3f9362dbb571e9fb2f3df60760c04\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nI get a bug where there's two search menus?!?!?\n(see the screenshot).

compiling instructions than for compiling with Visual\nStudio, except that Visual Studio is no more required.\n\nKNOWN ISSUES :\n- `methods.detect_visual_c_compiler_version()` will emit a warning message\n  on computers where the `VSINSTALLDIR` environement variable is not present.\n  But it should compile just fine and still automatically detects the 32 or\n  64 bits according to the compiler you picked.\n\nTODO :\n~~\\- try to make the `msvc_is_detected()` function available in all\nscript from global or import, so that it is not required to update it\nseveral time in each scripts where

I don't want the `game` object to know about a `control` `overlay` node, but I want the `overlay` node to know when `game` emits the `game_over` signal. The only way to do it now is to get `overlay` inside `game` and do `connect(\"game_over\", overlay, \"_on_game_over\")`. It would be really helpful if we could do something like this inside of the `overlay` node: `connect(game, \"game_over\", self, \"_on_game_over\"). In essence saying that`overlay`should observe the`game_over`signal from`game`object and trigger`_on_game_over`.

Things like Observable wrappers just seek to atomize data in a way that can create liabilities down the road (like multiple data structures holding references to the same observable by accident, instead of a single \"owner\" with everyone else observing/subscripting to the data).\n\n---\n\nAdditionally, with this pattern, you'll see it extended to collection types to fire an event when properties are added/removed to a collection (it should be noted that Array, Dictionary et al don't fire signals when their contents are modified and this is something you'd want to restrict to Nodes in the scene, anyways).\n\nAlso, once you have Observable collections, you can start modelling applications as handling streams of data over time, i.e. what's traditionally construed as \"reactive programming\". Just look at what's possible w/ RxPy (https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxPY)! I won't argue for/against-this as it's pretty advanced and something that requires a lot of discipline. There would be a lot of discovery to determine how it'd best fit into Godot (which is already very event driven, so these patterns would mostly be another approach to the same ideas/paradigms).\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\nI know everyone is busy with lots of other great features and fixes for the community. This is not a high priority change, but I feel like it would be high value.\n\nThis is something that would greatly facilitate and make clear to members of the community how applications can be structured to allow data to propagating freely to interested consumers. The observer pattern allows data-owners to focus on their own logic, as opposed to worrying about implementation details of other entities interested in their contents.\n\nThanks for your time!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6491/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6490","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6490/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6490/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6490/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/6490","id":177025885,"number":6490,"title":"Add WebM support","user":{"login":"zaps166","id":6239090,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6239090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaps166","html_url":"https://github.com/zaps166","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaps166/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaps166/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaps166/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaps166/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaps166/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaps166/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaps166/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaps166/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaps166/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":370471795,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:drivers","name":"topic:drivers","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":65,"created_at":"2016-09-14T21:26:35Z","updated_at":"2016-11-15T12:47:39Z","closed_at":"2016-10-30T17:12:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/6490","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/6490","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/6490.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/6490.patch"},"body":"This PR adds WebM support for Godot: WebM (simplified MKV) container, VP8 and VP9 video codecs.

system or device - Godot version:**\n\nUbuntu 16.04\nI'm not sure if it effects any other OS, as I only have a Linux machine.\n\nEdit: I was able to get a hold of a machine running window 7.\n\nMaster\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\n\nJoystick release events seems to not happen occasionally resulting in input events while the joystick has been released. \n\nEdit: Additionally once it has gotten stuck, moving the Joystick in any other direction like the opposite direction to the direction it is stuck on does not cancel out the effect. For example If it gets stuck in the right direction, moving the joystick left does not stop the right movement, and the character will continue to move right after releasing. Only moving in the effected direction cancels the effect.\n\nI made sure it was not a bad gamepad on my end by testing two wired 360, and 5 wireless 360 game pads, and they all experience the same behaviour where direction input remains after completely releasing the joystick. \n\nI bisected the commit where it starts. https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/8c886b9d7a22bfacf25a5f3303c25c099abf55f9\n\nPrevious commits do not have the issue.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n\nMap a joystick to any of the demo games. I used the 2d platformer demo, and mapped left and right movement to the joystick. It dosen't happen every time, but if you move the joystick left then quickly move right and release the joystick the moment it hits completely to the right the character will continue to move as if the joystick hasn't been released. It usually takes me two of three times before it happens. Moving the joystick in a 360 movement then releasing also causes as well.\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6488/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6487","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6487/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6487/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6487/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6487","id":176948882,"number":6487,"title":"GDscript is slowed down by new lines and comments","user":{"login":"SuperUserNameMan","id":9801802,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/9801802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan","html_url":"https://github.com/SuperUserNameMan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279098082,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:gdscript","name":"topic:gdscript","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-09-14T16:03:32Z","updated_at":"2016-10-22T10:45:46Z","closed_at":"2016-10-22T10:45:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Operating system or device -
