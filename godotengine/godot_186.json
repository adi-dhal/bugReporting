The KinematicBody2D can be moved with the arrow keys and prints \"ENTER\" and \"EXIT\" to the console when it enters or exits the Area2D, respectively. The KinematicBody2D also contains an AnimationPlayer, with a 3 seconds long animation consisting of nothing but a single key at the beginning of a track that animates the extents of the KinematicBody2D's collision shape, it doesn't actually change the extents, just sets them to the same numbers that they already had. This animation does not play automatically or loop, you can make it play once by pressing the Z key.\n\nHow it behaves:\nIf you move inside the area, it will print \"ENTER\" normally, then if you press Z while inside it will print \"EXIT\", then 3 seconds later print \"ENTER\". If you are outside and press Z before entering, it will only print \"ENTER\" after the 3 seconds are over. The KinematicBody2D is effectively invisible to the Area2D while the animation is playing.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nSee sample project.\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\n[AnimatingCollisionShape.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/438225/AnimatingCollisionShape.zip)\n\nI apologize in advance if I messed up and this is not a

edit.*\r\n\r\n**Godot version:**\r\n2.1.3, current master\r\n\r\nWhen upgrade assets / reinstalling a new version, the editor will by default deselect all files with the same filename as in the previously installed version. This is non-optimal in the case of a plugin that users typically wouldn't edit, and for which they'd which the new files to overwrite the old ones (and actually the orphaned old files to be removed).\r\n\r\nLong story short, we need better handling of asset versions, with the ability for the project and the assetlib to keep track of installed versions, and to replace them by newer version. Files with user-side modifications that would be overwritten during an upgrade should be backed up.\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThat makes no sense when asset is from category tools (possible also other category).\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10463138/17902246/d5d65ce4-6966-11e6-8e61-1873e2b02500.png)\r\n\r\nI added it first on this repro https://github.com/godotengine/asset-library/issues/52\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6277/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4807","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"BF1A:572D:133CD58:2EC2B42:59D69C9D","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=187>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=185>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"e373ed404bf6f9deab52e5aae6172c05\"","status":"200 OK"}}
