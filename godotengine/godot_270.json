Maybe it's not a priority as 2.3 is kind of old now, but it supports the NDK and most of the phones from them have the same hardware as now so I don't really see any reason for them to be incapable of running Godot.)\n\nHas anyone else tested Godot on a 2.3 device?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3784/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3783","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3783/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3783/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3783/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3783","id":135019499,"number":3783,"title":"Added a setting in editor defining scene tabs close button policy.

enabled\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n- Create 3d scene\n- add staticBody with cube collider\n- activate \"Visible Collision Shapes\"\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16718859/13184726/c873b42c-d73d-11e5-9bfc-fc57d4e61ae3.png)\n- attach a script like this one:\n\n``` python\nextends StaticBody\nvar

UI, despite being nice, could use space better, so I've made a couple of mockups to give an idea where environment could be better. Nothing ambitious, just little changes to make space for what matters the most (Viewport area and sidebar).\n\n![untitled](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10696955/13177626/018fc2f2-d723-11e5-9952-ea8d615bfa44.png)\nThis one has all the elements on top bar (which, to be honest, could hold even Play Project group to give more space for scene tabs). It adds to mouse movement between animation player and animation button but looks pretty clean. \n![untitled1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10696955/13178109/e1b11cee-d725-11e5-8bee-9b0c52090166.png)\nIn this mockup Animation, Output and Debugger elements are left on bottom, which adds to mouse movements to them, but makes bottom bar popping up a bit more intuitive. Scroll bar is moved a little bit. \n\nAlso, I'd like to talk about right click and drag-n-drop friendly nodes in scene tree. Right click is just not used in Godot for some reason. Presenting all the buttons right away is nice and all, but there's a hardware button that can give so much more. \n- Some of the options (Delete, Reparent, Node connections, Node groups, Replace by another type, Duplicate) can be placed in contextual menu on right click. \n- Reparenting should be possible with dragging nodes inside the tree. \n- Right click on resources in the FileSystem tab should open up a menu with rename or move, delete, view owners. \n- By dragging and dropping files in folders people should be able to move resources.\n- Right click on element inside the scene should open up a contextual menu that shows node type, name and script bound to the node (with quick option to jump to script).\n\nThis way it's possible to reduce the overall amount of all the buttons (or give more ways to get to a feature for a user). \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3778","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3778/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3778/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3778/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/3778","id":134867579,"number":3778,"title":"OS.set_video_mode() not working on Android","user":{"login":"czlowiekimadlo","id":649405,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/649405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/czlowiekimadlo","html_url":"https://github.com/czlowiekimadlo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czlowiekimadlo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czlowiekimadlo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czlowiekimadlo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czlowiekimadlo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czlowiekimadlo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czlowiekimadlo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czlowiekimadlo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czlowiekimadlo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czlowiekimadlo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097562,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:android","name":"platform:android","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":14,"created_at":"2016-02-19T13:43:34Z","updated_at":"2017-01-14T13:56:23Z","closed_at":"2017-01-14T13:56:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device:**\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S with Android 5.0.1\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nChanging video modes in runtime is not working on Android devices.
