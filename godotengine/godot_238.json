So I created a simple node and tried this:\n`get_tree().set_edited_scene_root(node)\n`\nA few days ago, this caused the editor to crash. With a more recent build (compiled from master), it doesn't crash anymore. The node doesn't seem to appear at first, but as soon as the screen gets updated (e.g. by clicking on the \"add node\" button and going back), the root node does appear, but the editor ignores it and behaves as if there was no root node.  The Console shows this error:\n\n> ERROR: get_path: Condition ' !is_inside_tree() ' is true. returned: NodePath()\n\nIs this actually a bug, or am I using this function completely wrong? There seems to be no documentation about it.\n\nHere's a minimal example project.

edit:_ Apparently the editor parses `engine.cfg` and reuses most of it unless there are some checks to avoid it. It should be fixed all at once, hence we'll merge related issues with this one.\n\n---\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nThe editor is using input map actions from the project's settings. Therefore, modifying input presets (`ui_*`) affects the editor too. This can break usability in many situations, like removing <kbd>ENTER</kbd> from the `ui_accept` (pressing <kbd>ENTER</kbd> when focusing a button will not longer press the button).\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nActually, being able to remove keys from input presets may be a bug. [This comment](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4315#issuecomment-209876046) explains how to do it:\n\n> It looks like if you add another key to that action, then you can remove the other keys and it will be saved.\n> · neikeq\n\nThe solution may be to forbid modifying input presets, but it stills seems weird that the editor is using the project's input map.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4739/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":2,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4738","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4738/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4738/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4738/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4738","id":156099291,"number":4738,"title":"get_item_rect() needs improvements!!","user":{"login":"RebelliousX","id":1888186,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1888186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX","html_url":"https://github.com/RebelliousX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RebelliousX/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":279537176,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/hacktoberfest","name":"hacktoberfest","color":"00eeee","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-05-21T12:16:28Z","updated_at":"2016-06-15T10:00:03Z","closed_at":"2016-06-14T00:37:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**[PROLOGUE] - ranting, sorry!**\nDue to the unpredictable behavior of KinematicBody2D #1472 which I am trying to create pixel-perfect game. I am forced to use Area2D instead. I managed to make Area2D as a \"solid\" object with \"slide\" effect, following this article about [swept AABB](http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/technical/game-programming/swept-aabb-collision-detection-and-response-r3084). Which regrettably, makes me forfeit the use of collision detection of Godot and implement my own, including **\"snap to grid smooth movement\"** which Godot Engine **doesn't have**, but most other engines (Unity, GameMaker..etc) have it supported, but that is for another issue. (it is solvable using script, but it is better to have it supported in the engine for grid games).\n\nAll of that worked fine since I worked with 64x64 pixels images in my testing project. But when I tried to work with other sizes, issues began.\n\n**[ISSUE]**\nWhen I call `get_item_rect()` function, I expected to get a `Rect2` that has the position of the item and the **`size` of all of its children enclosed and expanded in the Rect2 structure (fit all children)**. But I only get the size of 64x64. Also, using `get_item_rect()` for a rectangular with extents of 64x64 `CollisionShape2D` (for a 128x128 sprite) I get a 134x134 for its size **:/**\n\nMaybe the following picture can get my idea better (excuse my 30 seconds scribble using mspaint)\n![untitled](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1888186/15448294/0f1b853a-1f23-11e6-8e26-cb18c513e5a1.png)\n\n**[EPILOGUE]**\nI think Godot can easily implement this, since it already has \"expand() or grow()\" in Rect2 class. Besides, it will make it easier to be noticed in the editor to see the expanded rectangle with all its children.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4738/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4737","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4737/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4737/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4737/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4737","id":156099136,"number":4737,"title":"Changes to open dir in native explorer RMB option","user":{"login":"Geequlim","id":6964556,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6964556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geequlim","html_url":"https://github.com/Geequlim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geequlim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geequlim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geequlim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geequlim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geequlim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geequlim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geequlim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geequlim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geequlim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-05-21T12:13:00Z","updated_at":"2016-05-21T12:17:52Z","closed_at":"2016-05-21T12:17:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/4737","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4737","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4737.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4737.patch"},"body":"Rename 'Show In System' to 'Show In File Manager'\nReplace path from DirAccess::get_full_path to Globals::globalize_path\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4737/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4736","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4736/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4736/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4736/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4736","id":156096806,"number":4736,"title":"Binary to TSCN/TRES converter","user":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":283518733,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"007700","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-05-21T11:18:16Z","updated_at":"2017-08-08T12:45:58Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"I've converted a few projects from XML or binary formats to the new TSCN/TRES formats of Godot 2.0.

we update build gradle to use `compileSdkVersion 23`,\n`org.apache.http` package causes error. (issue #4711)\n\nWe need to use `useLibrary 'org.apache.http.legacy'` to solve this problem.\nTo use `useLibrary`, we need to use latest gradle also.\n\nAnd now, we faced another problem with `APK Expansion` java sources.\n\n```\n/platform/android/java/src/com/google/android/vending/expansion/downloader/impl/DownloadNotification.java\n137 :             mCurrentNotification.setLatestEventInfo(mContext, mCurrentTitle, mCurrentText, mContentIntent); // causes error\n```\n\nSo, some of APK Expansion java sources are updated by referencing commits from https://github.com/danikula/Google-Play-Expansion-File\nAnd dropped V3CustomNotification.java which was for android 3.0, since godot supports android 14 (4.0) above officially.\n\nUnfortunately,

editor of the engine is implemented in C ++.

Yet if you do based on the script editor you can reduce this time.\n2 The complexity of development. C ++ harder than Godot script.\n3 Weak customization. What would make changes in the editor will have to rebuild the engine. If he was on the script editor can be directly changed by itself in the process of project development.\nOf course all this is not an indicator that would drop everything and remake editor c ++ on Godot script. Still, it may be worthwhile to move in this direction. Especially since there are examples. For example, \"Kakos creator\" and \"urno\" exactly what do. perhaps someone else.\nIt turned out as it is messy.
