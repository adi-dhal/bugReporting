Of course one might say that there are cars loaded scripts. You can use them. But they are made as a node. And get them out of difficult subclasses. It is necessary to transmit the node. Either create a helper class instance. There's a lot that can be said. But what do you think about the fact that to do in Unity, hang on the node class rather than the entire file?\nPS.

10 - Godot 2.0.3\n\n(This issue seems to be specific to Windows operating systems. It did not show up on iOS or on Android.)\n\n**Situation**\n\nI have a project with 3 nodes:\n1. Sprite\n2. Node2D\n3. Area2D (with a child shape, etc.)\n\nBoth Node2D and Area2D have a script that moves the Sprite to a different position when the mouse is clicked. Node2D does this with _input(ev) and Area2D does this with _input_event(...).\n\n**What I expected**\n\nIf I click somewhere not on Area2D's shape, the Sprite will move directly to the position specified by Node2D. If I click on Area2D's shape, the Sprite will move directly to the position specified by Area2D. This is because events are handled by _input(ev) before _input_event(...). So the Sprite would first go Node2D's specified position, and then go to Area2D's specified position, and then finally be drawn to the screen.\n\n**What happened**\n\nWhen I click on Area2D's shape, sometimes the Sprite is drawn at Node2D's specified position for a few frames, and then moves to Area2D's specified position. This seems like an error because the mouse click event is clearly being handled by Node2D, then a screen draw occurs before the event is handled by Area2D. I thought that an event should propagate through all nodes before a screen draw happens.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n\nIn a project, add 2 nodes, one of them a CollisionObject2D. Give one an _input(ev) function and the other an _input_event(...) function. Have them both alter a sprite in a similar way, like changing its location. To really see the issue clearly, add a time-intensive loop right before the CollisionObject2D node modifies the sprite, such as an unnecessary nested for loop.\n\nExample project demonstrating this issue: [Godot Demo.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/270561/Godot.Demo.zip)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4696","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4696/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4696/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4696/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4696","id":155375038,"number":4696,"title":"Improve the user:// path","user":{"login":"nunodonato","id":1642015,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1642015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunodonato","html_url":"https://github.com/nunodonato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunodonato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunodonato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunodonato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunodonato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunodonato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunodonato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunodonato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunodonato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunodonato/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-05-17T22:14:40Z","updated_at":"2016-05-17T22:19:22Z","closed_at":"2016-05-17T22:19:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:** all\n\n**Issue description**: Two things\n1 - the user path where files are saved should be the same as all other apps in that OS. for Linux, this is usually ~/.local/share/whatever.
