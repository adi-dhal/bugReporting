Issue\r\nOk I'm taking a look at the Visual Scripting to make some videos about it. Something I found very problematic is that you can't use an instance to make a simple call without having to instance it before, and there is no way to do.\r\n\r\nThat's how I would do it in GDScript\r\n```GDScript\r\nextends Node\r\nfunc _ready():\r\n    var t = Tween.new()\r\n    print(t)\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, I couldn't find a way to do this using Visual Script.\r\n\r\n# Solution (?)\r\nSince the CallInstance node already has everything available to do an instance call, I think it would be good to let it create an instance by default using the `Base Type` and passing this object in the `pass` output. \r\n\r\nE.g. this setup would be the same as the above example\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10171059/29093451-465093ba-7c60-11e7-8c9c-8b367fa4b19e.png)\r\n\r\nThe problem is that currently the `instance` input of this node is always null if another node doesn't pass a object output to it. And there is no way to set a value to it in the Inspector, so...as I said, I can't think of a way to have this working.\r\n\r\n# Real Life problems\r\nThis totally screw the workflow of a team of a programmer and a designer since the designer can't call a function from a GDScript created by the programmer... neither can we extend a Visual Scripting using class inheritance and making it inherits the GDScript created by the programmer, neither can we just make an instance call using the GDScript as `Base Script` of the CallInstance node. So thi won't work.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10171059/29093749-4fb8e5a0-7c61-11e7-8a2f-9f4166181671.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10171059/29093759-5784b368-7c61-11e7-9e83-4b47a64d5e26.png)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10178/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10177","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10177/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10177/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10177/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10177","id":248835779,"number":10177,"title":"Fix freeze on close of game using 2D physics introduced by #9832","user":{"login":"bojidar-bg","id":5276727,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5276727?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg","html_url":"https://github.com/bojidar-bg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":370471880,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:physics","name":"topic:physics","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-08-08T20:25:37Z","updated_at":"2017-08-11T08:37:52Z","closed_at":"2017-08-11T08:37:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/10177","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10177","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10177.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10177.patch"},"body":"Additionally, port the fix to 3D physics, just in case.\r\n\r\nNot completely sure why the code was written that way, though I can confirm that freezes go away with my patch.

system or device - Godot version:**\r\n\r\nWin10 current Godot3 build\r\n\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nISSUE1 - The default world environment that is loaded into each new scene (default_env.tres) has the ambient_light_sky_contribution = 0.0 value. This means that any meshes that are added to the scene with high roughness values will be seen as black. This value should be default at 1. I am fairly sure that this changed not too long ago!\r\n\r\nThis is particularly problematic when using separate scenes for objects that will be instanced into a master scene. In these separate scenes, you currently have to add a new environment just to setup a material, then hide it when it is instanced into a master scene\r\n\r\nThis is currently what we get:\r\n\r\n![default_env](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7741669/29054427-7e039c16-7c39-11e7-8922-9f8e3e04aad2.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis what it should be:\r\n\r\n![fixed_env](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7741669/29054435-8ad6f7ee-7c39-11e7-9e3a-c7946fc98f56.jpg)\r\n\r\nISSUE2: The default metallic value for a spatial material is currently 0.1. Most materials will be either a metal (1) or dielectric (0), so having 0.1 is confusing for someone new to the engine, as they may think it is a good default value. \r\n\r\nThe default should be either 0 or 1. The advantage of having it at 0 is that materials are more likely to be non-metallic (dielectric) than metallic, so may serve as a better starting point. Also having both metallic and roughness at default 0 gives a pleasing result for a material, as seen below:\r\n\r\n![material0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7741669/29054785-a7197704-7c3b-11e7-84d7-197d44649d0c.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe advantage to having it at 1 as default is that when adding maps, this value needs to be changed to 1 anyway. However the same would apply to the roughness value and if both of these were at a default of 1, then the default material shows as all black and is not a good starting point, as seen below:\r\n\r\n![material1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7741669/29054796-b4170d90-7c3b-11e7-8281-bc57d1e7c525.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\n<!-- Optional but very welcome.

Wouldn't that make Godot a LOT more powerful for acquiring and comparing groups of nodes? In fact, it's probably the ONLY engine that could do this effectively.\r\n\r\nExample syntax off the top of my head:\r\n(note, these would all return a specialized Array type where attempts to get/set a property or execute a method NOT associated with the custom Array type would instead attempt to do that on the first item of the array)\r\n\r\n- $(self): executes relative to the current script\r\n- $(node_reference): executes relative to the given node\r\n- $(\"#name\"): equivalent to `get_node(\"name\")`\r\n- $(\"Button\"): captures into an array all nodes derived from the Button type\r\n- $(\"CustomButton\"): First searches for a built-in type by the name CustomButton. After that fails, it searches through local / member variables of the current script for something called \"CustomButton\". If that fails, it throws an error. If it succeeds, then it preloads the value of that variable looking for a script resource (.gd, .vs, .cs, .gdns). If it finds it, then it will capture into an array all nodes derived from the CustomButton type\r\n- $(\"HBoxContainer Label\"): captures all Label-derived nodes that are descendants of an HBoxContainer.\r\n- $(\"HBoxContainer > Label\"): captures all Label-derived nodes that are immediate children of an HBoxContainer.\r\n- $(\"Node:cool\"): captures all Node-derived nodes that have property \"cool\" set to true. If the property doesn't exist, or if it does exist, but is false, then it returns false. Otherwise true.\r\n- $(\"Enemy~do_cool\"): captures all Enemy-derived custom nodes that have a method do_cool.\r\n- $(\"Node[prop=value]\"): captures all Node-derived nodes with property \"prop\" that has value \"value\".\r\n- $(\"Node.group_name\"): captures all Node-derived nodes in the group \"group_name\".\r\n- $(\"?#MyNode\"): captures all nodes with the name \"MyNode\" *relative to the local scene root*.\r\n- $(\"!Label\"): captures all Label-derived nodes *relative to the global scene root*. (obviously, things like \"#name\" wouldn't work for instanced nodes in this scenario)\r\n- $(\"!\"): equivalent to get_tree().get_root()\r\n\r\nI do get that this functionality may not be desired as part of the main GDScript module and possibly preferred as a plugin. If that is the case, then it would be nice if the engine made allowances for plugins to define global variables / functions, so that something like this could be done with G(...) or what-have-you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10155/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10154","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10154/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10154/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10154/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/10154","id":248519034,"number":10154,"title":"Optionally limit exported ints/floats to positive/negative","user":{"login":"MutantOctopus","id":14201600,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/14201600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MutantOctopus","html_url":"https://github.com/MutantOctopus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MutantOctopus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MutantOctopus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MutantOctopus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MutantOctopus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MutantOctopus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MutantOctopus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MutantOctopus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MutantOctopus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MutantOctopus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279537176,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/hacktoberfest","name":"hacktoberfest","color":"00eeee","default":false},{"id":279098082,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:gdscript","name":"topic:gdscript","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2017-08-07T20:16:59Z","updated_at":"2017-09-26T07:02:27Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"This is just a minor QoL improvement - it'd be nice to have an export hint for `int` and `float` types that allows you to specify whether you'll only allow positive/negative values (including 0).
