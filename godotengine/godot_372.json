it is stated in http://devmaster.net/devdb/engines/godot godot engine supports 2D pathfinding and I think if devs read that, at some extent they count on it.\n\nWhen you put hands on it, you see a different picture:\n\n1) It no where documented have to use it. \n2) The only info that I could find is in this forum thread http://www.godotengine.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=625&start=10 where the conclusion is that it doesn't work at all (THATS THE ISSUE).\n3) Anyway the concept with pathway alpha maps seems wrong. Every time I put some static object (for ex. a house) on my map, I have to redraw the alpha some-have, and it's not dynamic at all (for ex. if the house moves at run-time). \n\nSo are there any plans to implement a collider based Pathfinding. One that takes in account collisions and tries to get around them?
