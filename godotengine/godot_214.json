system or device - Godot version:**\n\nTested on official 2.0.3stable win64, and on custom 2.1alpha compiled by @calinou few days ago. \nRunning under Windows 8.1 64.\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\n\n`I'M HAVING TROUBLE EXPLAINING THIS ISSUE CLEARLY AND SIMPLY`\n_so please, in case my description appears confusing, follow the step by step guide below to reproduce the issue and read the minimal example project script to have a better understanding of what i'm talking about._\n\nBefore running the project, you have a USB Xinput controller (like XBOX360 gamepad) and a USB DirectInput controller (like Thrustmaster dual analog 3) that are connected at the same time.\n\nWhen you run the project, the Xinput controller will have device number 0, and the DirectInput controller will have device number 1.\n\nStill at runtime, if you unplug the DirectInput controller, the signal callback `joy_connection_changed` will receive a device number 0 instead of 1, and `Input.is_joy_known(0)` will return false instead of true, and `Input.is_joy_know(1)` will return true instead of false.\n\nWhen you connect theDirectInput controler again, `joy_connection_changed` will receive a device number 1 (which is correct), but `Input.is_joy_known(0)` will still return false instead of true.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nUsing the minimal example project, follow this step by step guide.\n\n1) BEFORE RUNNING THE PROJECT, plug an USB Xinput controller (like Xbox 360 controller) and a DirectInput USB controller (like a Thrustmaster dual analog 3).\n\n2) run the example project.\n\n3) you should read :\n- \"joy 0 : XInput Gamepad\"\n- \"joy 1 : Thrustmaster Dual Analog 3.2\"\n- \"joy 2 :\" should be grayed\n- \"joy 3 :\" should be grayed\n\n4) press your controllers buttons to verify their device number as returned to _Input(event).\n- XInput controller device number should be 0.\n- DirectInput controller should be 1.\n\n5) unplug the DirectInput controller.\n\n6) You'll notice that \"joy 0 : XInput Gamepad\" will vanish instead of \"joy1\", and that the signal callback joy_connection_changed() will receive device_id 0 instead of 1.\n\n7) press your Xinput controller buttons to verify its device number. \nIt still should be 0.\n\n8) plug the DirectInput controller back, and notice that this time the signal callback joy_connection_changed() will receive device_id 1.\n\n9) unplug and replug the DirectInput controller and see that the device_id is 0 when unplugging, and 1 when replugging.\n\n**Link to minimal

now it can be quite confusing when the script editor is opened and there's no obvious way to tell which script is being edited. I know that the sidepanel shows the opened scripts and colors them depending on usage(?), but it quickly becomes a headache to find the opened file when there are like 20 opened files and all are red.\n\nThat's why I suggest to show the focused script name in the window/application title, when the \"script view\" is active. Currently it only shows the scene name, but imo it would be better if it distinguishes between the active view (\"2D/3D/Script\") and adjusts the title accordingly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5450/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5449","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5449/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5449/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5449/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5449","id":162433672,"number":5449,"title":"Add

not an issue, but just a suggestion. The hierarchy in both Add Node and Classes dialogs are fine, but they have some problems of readability like some items having icons, and others not. The fact that some items don't have icons makes the alignment in the hierarchy pretty messy. Example:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19820741/16365667/86b6a44a-3bdd-11e6-994e-ffd52f20d8bf.png)\n\nI suggest four alternatives to this:\n\n1: Removing icons (not a good idea, but at least it's said).\n2: Put the icons in the right side of the words (making the words be aligned).\n3: Making the items that don't have icons inherit one from the last parent that haves a icon (making the icons be aligned).\n4: Adding a reference guideline in each level of hierarchy, making easier to read, like this:\n\n![example_grid_reference](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19820741/16365660/581f44ca-3bdd-11e6-830b-c2d9b8f59208.png)\n\nAlso, when the same dialogs are open, the tree is expanded by default, and sometimes is convenient to search category through category. Since there's a lot of items to scroll, and collapse one by one would be inefficient, a button to toggle expand/collapse all items in hierarchy (including the inner items) would be awesome.\n\nI hope you consider this possibilities, that will surely make the interface cleaner.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5442/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5441","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5441/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5441/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5441/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5441","id":162353005,"number":5441,"title":"[Feature Request] CanvasLayerTexture || CanvasItemMaskedTexture","user":{"login":"MarianoGnu","id":1776044,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1776044?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarianoGnu","html_url":"https://github.com/MarianoGnu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarianoGnu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarianoGnu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarianoGnu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarianoGnu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarianoGnu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarianoGnu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarianoGnu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarianoGnu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarianoGnu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279097162,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/discussion","name":"discussion","color":"ee77ee","default":false},{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":279098111,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:rendering","name":"topic:rendering","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/7","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/7","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/7/labels","id":2529217,"number":7,"title":"3.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":114,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2017-05-18T13:33:56Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T12:23:57Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-06-26T23:12:43Z","updated_at":"2017-08-05T12:48:04Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"When working with 2D Shaders sometimes you need a sample ob objects in the screen, but not all of them, for example when working with reflections: not all object will be reflectible.\nRight now the only way to do the work is using different viewports for every layer and use a ViewportSprite to render them on screen, this is an unconfortable workflow, since the user has to take into acount of game resolution, scrolling and everything itself, and also make sure your objects belongs to the same viewport.\n\nSome solutions i have thought of are:\n- Use a CanvasLayer to get a rendered texture\n- Have a CanvasItemMask property on viewports, this would allow to have many viewports share the same world and render specific masks. Another option would be to use a CanvasLayer mask, but since CanvasLayers are indexed instead of masked, i can't think in a way to have a proper way to define the layers other than an IntArray with would not be so straightforward.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5440","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5440/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5440/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5440/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5440","id":162352694,"number":5440,"title":"[RPMLint] A lot of warings when compiling code on openSUSE","user":{"login":"susnux","id":1855448,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1855448?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/susnux","html_url":"https://github.com/susnux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susnux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susnux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susnux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susnux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susnux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susnux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susnux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susnux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susnux/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279537176,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/hacktoberfest","name":"hacktoberfest","color":"00eeee","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-06-26T23:05:15Z","updated_at":"2017-05-18T11:04:21Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Compiling Godot 2.0.3 on openSUSE Tumbleweed (gcc6).\n\nI get following warnings when comping godot:\n\n1 - Undefined behavior of statements:\n\n```\nI: Program causes undefined operation\n   (likely same variable used twice and post/pre incremented in the same expression).\n   e.g. x = x++; Split it in two operations.\nW: godot sequence-point scene/animation/tween_interpolaters.cpp:260, 265, 271, 288, 293, 299, 367, 373, 375\nW: godot sequence-point scene/gui/line_edit.cpp:455, 459\n```\n\nAn example is:\n\n```\nreturn c * (t /= d) * t * t + b;\n```\n\nWhat I think should result in:\n\n```\nreturn c * (t / d) ^ 3 + b;\n```\n\nBut I think it is also possible the compiler interprets it as:\n\n```\nreturn c * t * t * (t / d) + b;\n```\n\n2 - strict-aliasing warnings:\n\n```\n I: Program is likely to break with new gcc.
