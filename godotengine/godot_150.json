Godot version:**\r\nGodot 2.1.1, Fedora 25\r\n\r\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\r\nI am trying to make cars customizable and have the chassis/wheels be swappable, so I tried to load tires into a scene and get it to work however it appears like you cannot load vehicle wheels from a different scene and have the physics still apply\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nYou could manually make a scene that has a vehicle wheel, and a graphical mesh if you want something visible; load it into a separate scene containing a vehicle and attach it as a child. You could also import my project into Godot and see the issue for yourself.\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\r\nhttps://notabug.org/bkeys/DMUX","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7381/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7380","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7380/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7380/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7380/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/7380","id":197767640,"number":7380,"title":"Loading .xm files into EventPlayer via file dialogue crashes Editor","user":{"login":"spookdogg","id":16293514,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/16293514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spookdogg","html_url":"https://github.com/spookdogg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spookdogg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spookdogg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spookdogg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spookdogg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spookdogg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spookdogg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spookdogg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spookdogg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spookdogg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-12-27T22:42:38Z","updated_at":"2017-01-02T13:13:21Z","closed_at":"2016-12-28T11:56:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device -

Godot is the best thing ever that happened for me as someone who is trying to make 2D games for the first time. At first I didn't liked GDscript, but after using it for few days I'm starting to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nMy biggest problem with GDscripting is the lack of useful information/details in the web documentation.\r\n\r\nWhen I search for .scale() I wish the website documentation could give me more information than this:\r\n> void scale ( Vector2 ratio )\r\n> Apply the ‘ratio’ scale to the 2D node, according to its current scale value.\r\n\r\nMaybe for you guys this is informative enough, but for me it isn't, and I also don't see the difference between scale() and set_scale().\r\n\r\nI'd love to read other people's opinion/experience/examples about certain function/topics/tutorials. For now I'm just following Youtube tutorials till I eventually find a video where someone shows how to properly use Scale() function.\r\n\r\nI've read that you guys don't like \"solutions\" from users. But this is a idea for a feature request.\r\n\r\nI really wish to see comment section for each API/function in Godot, something similar as PHP's documentation, A \"guestbook\" where people can share their experience and example codes with a simple comment. Integrate it with an upvotes and downvotes system, just like PHP's documentation to get most useful comments at top, and least useful stays bottom.\r\n\r\nThat way it's very easier and less scarier for people to contribute and talk about certain functions of Godot scripting API. Instead of going through Youtube video tutorials and spamming Reddit with questions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7359","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7359/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7359/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7359/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/7359","id":197407482,"number":7359,"title":"Getting a triangle based collision shape to go around a mesh","user":{"login":"bkeys","id":12195202,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12195202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkeys","html_url":"https://github.com/bkeys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkeys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkeys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkeys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkeys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkeys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkeys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkeys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkeys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkeys/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-12-23T17:55:50Z","updated_at":"2017-01-02T12:39:16Z","closed_at":"2016-12-24T11:06:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\r\nFedora 25 using Godot 2.1.1\r\n\r\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\r\nI am trying to get some triangle based collision shapes to go around my mesh, and I cannot seem to find a documented way to do this or fabricate it myself.
