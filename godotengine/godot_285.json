This seems to affect Godot applications in a bad way. \n\nSo there are a few issues to report here.\n1. Godot app viewport option (as opposite to 2d) seems to have no effect on Yosemite and resolution is never changed. In fact any choice combo simply makes the app goes in Yosemite full screen.\n2. Godot app does not go full screen on Yosemite if fullscreen is selected and on but resizable is not selected. In fact it prevents the app from ever being able to go full screen and the Yosemite fullscreen is greyed out and cannot be used.  \n3. Mouse near edge of the screen seems to trigger menu and dock (if hidden) right on top of the running app. This makes any game using say top and bottom window edge to scroll map (like for ex TBS) no longer possible. This is a big issue for me right now as I want the window to capture the mouse and the window to stay focused on the game . I don't wanna see any OS menus appearing on top of my game.\n   ![screen shot 2016-01-12 at 6 20 25 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6987027/12280050/3865c2d2-b959-11e5-9c5e-080ffc0cf0e6.png)\n   ![screen shot 2016-01-12 at 6 20 21 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6987027/12280143/c43c163a-b959-11e5-9de3-95ecc0482c8d.png)\n\nWhen OSX saves screenshots it removes the mouse pointer.

The behavior may be less deterministic in 2.0 Alpha.\n\nIn my experience (and in the attached example), all FileDialogs left with the default settings will not show the contents of the resources directory, although if you double-click where files and folders ought to be it will navigate through them.\n\nThe default access mode appears to be ACCESS_RESOURCES. Manually setting this will have no effect; the contents will still be invisible. For example:\n\n```\nextends FileDialog\nfunc _ready():\n    set_access(ACCESS_RESOURCES)\n```\n\nwill not be usable. Setting the access mode to any other access mode behaves as expected. Furthermore, setting the access mode to something else and then back to ACCESS_RESOURCES before the FileDialog is even drawn appears to help in some cases:\n\n```\nextends FileDialog\nfunc _ready():\n    set_access(ACCESS_RESOURCES)\n    set_access(ACCESS_USERDATA)\n    set_access(ACCESS_RESOURCES)\n```\n\nThe above will behave as expected in the example project, where the contents of the resources directory are visible.\n\nBut that workaround does not work in the actual project for which I'm trying to add a FileDialog. I have yet to figure out how to access the resources directory without the FileDialog's display of the resources directory's contents being invisible.\n\n[FileExample.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/87998/FileExample.zip)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3330/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3329","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3329/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3329/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3329/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3329","id":126266318,"number":3329,"title":"Color Ramp Editor Plugin Fix","user":{"login":"SaracenOne","id":12756047,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/12756047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne","html_url":"https://github.com/SaracenOne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":283518733,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"007700","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-01-12T20:17:10Z","updated_at":"2016-01-15T12:54:04Z","closed_at":"2016-01-15T12:54:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/3329","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3329","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3329.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3329.patch"},"body":"The Color Ramp Editor originally only assigned itself to the canvas editor thereby only making it appear when editing canvas item-derived nodes and not spatial-derived.

seem to work\n16:11:06 <eska> reduzio, punto, seems like it's that way since 1.1, so probably no one knows other than you? ^\n16:16:44 <reduzio> eska, that needs to be removed, it's pretty dangerous :|\n16:17:14 <reduzio> godot support exporting all the files to a folder instead of packing them and use them unpacked\n16:17:42 <reduzio> but updating a directory tree is kinda dangerous, so it's either changed to work exporting a zip with all stuff, or removed\n```\n\nThis change removes pack mode \"Copy\" and adds \"Exec+Zip\". I also renamed the options to hopefully be more expressive.\nAdditionally, `bundle` is now a separate toggle.\n\nRelated: #2788,
