I think it looks really cool especially combined with a new theme. to get an idea how this looks checkout this issue:\r\nhttps://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/7294\r\n\r\nI also would love to implement bold font since that would make a nice addition to the overall editor look.\r\n\r\nBut I'm not sure how I can achieve that with minimal changes.\r\nsince the make_default_theme function only takes one param for the font. so I would need to change that. also I'm not quite sure how the font pipeline works.\r\nI think I just add the otg file and SCons than adds that file to the font header. than it is a available as a global var stating with _\r\n\r\nwould be cool if someone can give me some help and explanation how to add bold font to the default editor theme.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is the same with other textures for the theme, but there are currently still a couple of minor issues with positioning of ui elements, they are sometimes to close to the ground. So we might need to do some position changes to the editor node.\r\nWould be happy for any possible help.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8232/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8231","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8231/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8231/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8231/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/8231","id":218758914,"number":8231,"title":"Godot doesn't render objects correctly","user":{"login":"hormoz1","id":13774078,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/13774078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hormoz1","html_url":"https://github.com/hormoz1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hormoz1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hormoz1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hormoz1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hormoz1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hormoz1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hormoz1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hormoz1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hormoz1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hormoz1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279098111,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:rendering","name":"topic:rendering","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-04-02T11:36:55Z","updated_at":"2017-04-03T11:58:04Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello.\r\nGodot doesn't render correctly all the objects created in here:\r\nhttps://ghostbin.com/paste/quj9s\r\nI found this issue to happen in version 2.2 of godot, haven't tested the other versions but I think the issue will happen in other versions except version 3 because it has new renderer too (maybe it will happen is version 3 too).\r\nIt uses this library: https://github.com/Zylann/godot_opensimplex but i don't think it is a problem of the library.\r\nhere is the problem that occurs:\r\nhttps://gfycat.com/NegativeValuableBaleenwhale\r\nSeems like it only occurs when the number goes more than a specific number, when testing, the number for me and someone else was different but at 100*100 we both had this problem.\r\nHere is also a scene that you can download and shows this issue:\r\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/212250894228652034/297829430015819776/tester.tscn\r\nTo see the problem, rotate the camera with your mouse.\r\nWhy is this happening?\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8230","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8230/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8230/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8230/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8230","id":218749130,"number":8230,"title":"Input: Update Gamepad mappings.
