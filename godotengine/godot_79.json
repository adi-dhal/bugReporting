What is important are the project files. Important for that person who will make a final version, the files are stripped of any user files, xcode will create those, make sure you strip them out of your copy too.\r\n\r\nNote that I am using XCode 9 beta at the moment but I think the template will work from XCode 7 and up.\r\n\r\nThe exporter will ask the user for an xcodeproj file to export too. \r\nThe name you use will be used for the other folders and files as well to brand the project.\r\nThe folder in which this file is to be created will be used to extract the contents of the zip file in. Both the project files and plist files will be parsed for placeholders. \r\n\r\nAfter the export is done xcode is started and the project file is loaded (this last step works only on Mac OS X and only

system or device - Godot version:**\r\n3.0\r\n\r\nHi,\r\nWhile going through the code of GraphEdit, I figured out that it did use a special offset value to place each node (the `offset` attribute within GraphNode). Consequently, this forces EditorGraph to handle GraphNodes, but no other kind of control. This is, in my humble opinion, quite a limitation. Any kind of control should be displayable on such a scrolling area.\r\n\r\nThus, I was wondering why not use the position value instead, but the fact is that it is used to draw each control relatively to its parent. And as its position may be a fixed value (the GraphEdit does not move), it is not easy to move of child nodes.\r\n\r\nTo simplify all of this, I wanted to suggest a new `child_offset` attribute in a control node, this would display all child nodes with the given offset. This would also enable a scrollable area with arbitrarily placed nodes (without the container, which automatically resizes the child nodes).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9507/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9506","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9506/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9506/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9506/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/9506","id":240619601,"number":9506,"title":"Slow access to getters, setters and node properties","user":{"login":"Shin-NiL","id":4077589,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4077589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shin-NiL","html_url":"https://github.com/Shin-NiL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shin-NiL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shin-NiL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shin-NiL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shin-NiL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shin-NiL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shin-NiL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shin-NiL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shin-NiL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shin-NiL/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279097162,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/discussion","name":"discussion","color":"ee77ee","default":false},{"id":279098082,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:gdscript","name":"topic:gdscript","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-07-05T11:22:25Z","updated_at":"2017-07-06T21:00:11Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\r\nWindows 10 Pro 64 - Godot 2.1.3-stable\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\n\r\nAnalyzing the bunnymark code once again, we found that the use of getters, setters and accessing nodes properties turn the execution of the code much slower.\r\n\r\nthis is the original bunny.gd code ([full project here](https://github.com/Shin-NiL/Godot-BunnyMark-CPP/tree/master/projects/godot-bunnymark-gdscript)):\r\n```\r\nextends Sprite\r\n\r\nvar velocity = Vector2(0, 0)\r\nvar gravity = 3\r\nvar max_x = 640\r\nvar min_x = 0\r\nvar max_y = 480\r\nvar min_y = 0\r\n\r\n\r\nfunc _ready():\r\n\tvar tex = preload(\"res://wabbit_alpha.png\")\r\n\tset_texture(tex)\r\n\tvelocity.x = randf() * 10\r\n\tvelocity.y = rand_range(5, 10)\r\n\tset_process(true)\r\n\t\r\nfunc _process(delta):\r\n\tvar pos = get_pos()\r\n\r\n\tpos.x += velocity.x\r\n\tpos.y += velocity.y\r\n\tvelocity.y += gravity\r\n\t\t\r\n\tif (pos.x > max_x):\r\n\t\tvelocity.x *= -1\r\n\t\tpos.x = max_x\r\n\telif (pos.x < min_x):\r\n\t\tvelocity.x *= -1\r\n\t\tpos.x = min_x\r\n\t\t\r\n\tif (pos.y > max_y):\r\n\t\tvelocity.y *= -0.8\r\n\t\tpos.y = max_y\r\n\t\tif (randf() > 0.5):\r\n\t\t\tvelocity.y -= randf() * 12;\r\n\t\t \r\n\telif (pos.y < min_y):\r\n\t\tvelocity.y = 0;\r\n\t\tpos.y = min_y;\r\n\t\t\r\nset_pos(pos)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExporting the executable to release mode we get:\r\nBunnies: 7000\r\nFPS: ~49\r\n\r\nChanging it to avoid using Vector2 properties:\r\n\r\n```\r\nextends Sprite\r\nvar velocity_x = 0\r\nvar velocity_y = 0\r\nvar gravity = 3\r\nvar max_x = 640\r\nvar min_x = 0\r\nvar max_y = 480\r\nvar min_y = 0\r\n\r\nfunc _ready():\r\n    var tex = preload(\"res://wabbit_alpha.png\")\r\n    set_texture(tex)\r\n    velocity_x= randf() * 10\r\n    velocity_y = rand_range(5, 10)\r\n    set_process(true)\r\n    \r\nfunc _process(delta):\r\n    var pos = get_pos()\r\n    var pos_x = pos.x\r\n    var pos_y = pos.y\r\n    pos_x += velocity_x\r\n    pos_y += velocity_y\r\n    velocity_y += gravity\r\n    if (pos_x > max_x):\r\n        velocity_x*= -1\r\n        pos_x = max_x\r\n    elif (pos_x < min_x):\r\n        velocity_x*= -1\r\n        pos_x = min_x\r\n    if (pos_y > max_y):\r\n        velocity_y *= -0.8\r\n        pos_y = max_y\r\n        if (randf() > 0.5):\r\n            velocity_y -= randf() * 12;\r\n    elif (pos_y < min_y):\r\n        velocity_y = 0;\r\n        pos_y = min_y;\r\n    set_pos(Vector2(pos_x, pos_y))\r\n```\r\n\r\nExporting the executable to release mode we get:\r\nBunnies: 8000\r\nFPS: ~54\r\n(If we were able to get rid of get_pos and set_pos the results would be even better)\r\n\r\nMy question is: is that behavior expected?
