Initially I changed `FileAccess::_chmod` to a pure virtual function, but then I had to add multiple implementations that do the same thing (e.g., in `FileAccessNetwork` or `FileAccessWindows`).

one if its members is not null, etc)\r\n- Experience jank, because code following the if statement is now executing(?) on main

We have a problem with the shadows for quite a long time  that goes against that goals.\r\n\r\nAll the lights produce shadows out of place (out of the box) and adjusting the bias to right place creates glitches.\r\n\r\n**1. Omni Light** \r\n\r\n- Cube : \r\nThe default bias is [0.1](https://imgur.com/ntcF9DS)5 but the shadows are on place with bias around [0.02-0.04](https://imgur.com/EGZ70OO).  The position of the shadows between editor and ingame are different. The shadows in the correct position show glitches in both editor and in game.\r\n\r\n- Paraboloid:\r\nThe default bias is [0.15](https://imgur.com/S4qxxic) but the shadows are _almost_ on place with bias\r\n[around 0](https://imgur.com/T4xFy6W). With this value glitches are shown both editor and in game. The position of the shadows between editor and ingame are different. With paraboloid it's imposible to get the shadows exactly in its correct place.\r\n\r\n**2. Spot Light**\r\n\r\nThe default [bias is 0.15](https://imgur.com/8ZyOp5T) but the shadows are on place with bias [around 0](https://imgur.com/IkssMVV). With this bias, artifacts show up in the editor but look fine in game.\r\n\r\n**3. Directional Light**\r\n\r\nThe default [shadow bias is 0.1 and the light default normal bias is 0.8](https://imgur.com/8ZyOp5T) but the shadows are _almost_ on place with bias [around 0 and light normal bias <= 0.20](https://imgur.com/8kkRiOG).  This values get artifacts on the editor and in game. In this type of light the amount of gliches in game change depending of the [resizing of the window](https://imgur.com/JgXn0Qj). It's imposible to get the shadows exactly in its correct place without big amounts of artifacts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_For the \"ease to use\" aproach we cant just force the user to search the value of the shadow bias to put the shadow where it should be from the begining._\r\n\r\n_From the \"state of the art renderer\" perspective, we need to have shadows that look ok, with an aceptable resolution out of the box and the users should be able to get the correct place for shadows without artifacts._\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nJust loading an asset and putting any king of light shows this issue, but you can activate/deactivate the types of lights in the demo attached to see the bias behaviour.\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example
