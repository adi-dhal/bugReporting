I'm finding that properties that require Attenuation curves tend to be a bit lacking. For example, if you want a spot light that doesn't fade out toward the edges, it's pretty much impossible to achieve. Similarly, having fog that starts a certain amount in and completely goes opaque after a distance isn't possible (as far as I can tell). Having a simple \"End\" property that the attenuation curve interpolates over would assist in this considerably.\n\nEDIT: Actually, it seems like fog in general is broken. It seems like it works on a per-vertex basis rather than a per-pixel basis.
