Some times user switches scenes so fast, that old Control is not yet freed but new one is connected. Callback _ready is triggered and  get_scene().get_root().get_node(\"Control/Panel\") founds not the Panel on new scene but Panel on old scene that is going to be freed soon. Result is that node is 'null' and godot crashes.\n\nTree at the moment of crash looks as follow:\n root/Control/Panel/\n root/Control@459/Panel\n\nThere is few solutions for this race condition.\n1. When adding a node to scene, name is unique, for example let assume that developer adds Control to root of each scene, right now it would be called just Control, while godot can enforce that each node on default is going to get unique id for example Control<some_random_number_or_hash_or_timestamp>, this can later be changed by developer but by default they are unique\n2. make node paths per project unique, similar to above but this time godot will crash if given path is already registered\n3. get_scene().get_root().get_node() is ignoring scenes that are going to be removed, right now when adding new scene, if there is clash of names new scene is getting Id at the end of node name, while old scene is left intact, make it opposite, so that get_node() will find Control from new scene but not old\n4. add for autoloader documentation remark that free is asynchronous and it's strongly recommended to use unique names for important nodes as there might be clash of paths in between queue.free and add_child\n\nGeneral remark.\n\nAs far as I can tell such race condition exists, however if I am wrong and it's my error, please let me know what I am doing wrong. In such case it might be useful to update wiki as well (section regarding scene autoloader/switcher, might be a good one).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/638/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/637","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/637/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/637/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/637/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/637","id":40814830,"number":637,"title":"Fixed copy process of stream of bytes for HttpClient.","user":{"login":"Drachenfels","id":135730,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/135730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Drachenfels","html_url":"https://github.com/Drachenfels","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Drachenfels/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Drachenfels/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Drachenfels/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Drachenfels/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Drachenfels/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Drachenfels/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Drachenfels/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Drachenfels/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Drachenfels/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-08-21T15:14:55Z","updated_at":"2014-09-17T12:57:48Z","closed_at":"2014-09-17T12:57:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/637","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/637","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/637.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/637.patch"},"body":"Previously if request was not chunked and longer than arbitrary chunk of\n4096 bytes, rest was truncated.
