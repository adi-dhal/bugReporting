It seems the issue is the call to `clear()` in InputBar's `_input()` function. If that call is commented out, then things behave as expected BUT InputBar's text is not cleared out after hitting Enter. \r\n\r\nReplacing `clear()` with `set_text(\"\")` does not fix the issue (the same thing happens). \r\n\r\nAssuming that this is because of some issue due to passing-by-reference when there should be a pass-by-copy, I tried replacing `emit_signal(\"enter_hit\", get_text())` with `emit_signal(\"enter_hit\", String(get_text()))` and `emit_signal(\"enter_hit\", str(get_text()))`, with no success.\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example
