system or device - Godot version:**\r\n\r\nGodot Engine 2.1.4 Beta, Windows 10, OUYA/Android(Release 4.1.2)\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\n<!-- What happened, and what was expected. -->\r\n\r\nWhen I saw that a new patch #4944 by Marcelo Fernandez has been applied for the 2.1.4 Beta release of Godot, I knew that there wouldn't be any further problems for the OUYA to crash when using the controller. After uploading one of the template projects to see how good it runs the game works and the controls are operational.\r\n\r\nWell, the controls barely works. The joysticks and the trigger buttons (L2 & R2) does not work right whatsoever. the Left joystick uses joy axis 1 and 3 while the Right joystick does not use any axis number at all. Then the (L2 & R2) buttons are not responding when I push the button in. The other buttons work but other than that, I do see progress that exporting to the console is more tollerable. However, this controller issue needs to be dealt with.\r\n\r\nI have uploaded a new demo project \"OUYA_Debug\" so then everyone can clone it and open it in the Godot Engine to export and run it on the Android Console to test the controls.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n\r\nThis is an Android Console but there is a lengthy setup to get the game project exported to OUYA\r\n1. On the OUYA's dev website, Cortex Devs: (https://devs.ouya.tv/developers/docs/env_setup) read the Environment Setup to allow the game console to connect to your computer with the right configuration to the adb.exe and google usb connection software. [PLEASE NOTE THAT THE INSTRUCTIONS SAYS THAT IT WORKS ON WINDOWS AND MAC. CAN'T GUARANTEE LINUX SUPPORT FOR INSTALLING OUYA. SORRY.]\r\n\r\n2. On the Godot Docs, the documentation is explanatory if you need info or a refresh on how to export games to android: http://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/learning/workflow/export/exporting_for_android.html\r\n\r\nLENGTHY yes, but it does work.\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\nhttps://github.com/Corruptinator/OUYA_Debug (Use this to export to OUYA)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9390/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9389","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9389/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9389/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9389/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/9389","id":238430487,"number":9389,"title":"\"Clone to position\" shortcut","user":{"login":"homer666","id":27100585,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/27100585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666","html_url":"https://github.com/homer666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279537176,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/hacktoberfest","name":"hacktoberfest","color":"00eeee","default":false},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":283518733,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"007700","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-06-26T02:58:26Z","updated_at":"2017-09-11T17:44:06Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think it would be convenient to have the ability to create and place clones of an object with one action.

Clicking the button would run exported method. Script using such feature would have to use `tool` keyword of course. \r\n\r\nI saw @kubecz3k have been using setgets in his Finite State Machine plugin for similar behavior - you can write state name into exported string and then setget handles creation of the state (or something like that, I haven't read the code yet). I think my idea is cleaner approach for tools working in editor.\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n```gdscript\r\ntool\r\nextends Node2D\r\nexport var something = \"foo\"\r\nexport my_func \"Create Foo\" # function name, button text\r\n\r\nfunc my_func(): # no parameters!\r\n    # do something\r\n    # no return, runs purely for side effects\r\n```\r\n![insp-bttn-mckp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4397533/27520350-aac40f76-5a09-11e7-9f4e-072a874b17b1.png)\r\n\r\n**Downsides**\r\nI'm not sure if inspector is good place to that kind of functionality. On the other hand writing editor plugin that adds few buttons to toolbar seems to be overkill to me. As an alternative to my idea I'd suggest putting exported functions/buttons in the toolbar when the node is selected - editor would handle adding/removing button automatically.\r\n![mkp2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4397533/27520387-ffd88f2c-5a0a-11e7-8749-3941b850a81a.png)\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9380/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9379","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9379/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9379/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9379/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9379","id":238410756,"number":9379,"title":"Fixed RegEx::search missing return type hint","user":{"login":"leezh","id":185322,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/185322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezh","html_url":"https://github.com/leezh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-06-25T22:19:07Z","updated_at":"2017-06-26T21:13:35Z","closed_at":"2017-06-26T20:33:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/9379","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9379","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9379.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9379.patch"},"body":"Was probably overlooked when the auto-complete features were being added.
