Array slicing will hopefully be implemented later, but\nnegative indexing is useful in it's own right.\n\nA negative index is indexing from the end of an array,\n\"array[-1] == array[array.size()-1]\", using a negative index\nlarger/smaller than the length of the array is still an error.\n\nWhile primarily useful for arrays and strings, support is also added to\n\"array like\" structures like Vector3 and Color. This is done just\nto be consistent; vector3[2] is much clearer than vector3[-1], but disallowing\nit while allowing it for an array with 3 elements seems confusing.\n\nI'm on the fence on that last paragraph, I see no useful use case for it, but think it's better to be consistent and allow negative indexing everywhere.

If not, then I could try to implement in it the c++ code myself and do a pull request. My first thought was to create a EditorPlugin script, but I was not able to find any way of modifying the snap settings in the editor that way. Is it possible to access somehow from script, or is c++ the only way?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4850/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4849","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4849/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4849/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4849/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4849","id":157297557,"number":4849,"title":"No Code Completion For Script Instanced Nodes","user":{"login":"toliaferrode","id":18036668,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/18036668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode","html_url":"https://github.com/toliaferrode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toliaferrode/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-05-27T21:56:27Z","updated_at":"2016-06-01T21:05:55Z","closed_at":"2016-05-27T23:42:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\nLinux, Godot 2.0.3\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nI followed the instancing tutorial for scripting.

avoid propagating it when already handled.\n\n~~e.g: When the 2D editor and the shader editor are both visible, pressing <kbd>CTRL+F</kbd> with a node selected, both editors will handle the event, no matter which one is focused. The 2D editor will do _\"Frame Selection\"_ and the shader editor will popup the search dialog.~~\n\n~~#### Do Not Merge!:\nThis PR is incomplete. It just avoids propagating the event if it was used. However, there is still other bug with `MenuButton` that need to be fixed. Until it's fixed, this PR may result in an even worse usability problem.\nThat bug is that there is no priority when propagating  unhandled key events to `MenuButton`s. Therefore, considering the previous example, if this PR is merged, the events will always be used by the shader editor's menu instead of the menu whose editor is focused, which is the expected behaviour.\nA possible fix could be to create a relation between the `MenuButton` and that editor/Container, and handle the hotkey event only if that editor is a parent of the focused Control (`is_a_parent_of()`). I don't know what would be the performance penalty though.\nHere is an issue about this last bug:

system or device - Godot version:**\nWindows 10, Godot nightly build (but applies to 2.0.3 and earlier)\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nIt's possible to attempt a one-click deploy of an unsigned APK. This doesn't ever make sense. I'd expect the \"Package/Signed\" option to be ignore for one-click deployment. Not a HUGE issue but consider my use case where I need to export a release unsigned APK and so I have to check/uncheck this option when going between 1-click and export.\n(edit: it's true I can 're-sign' an already signed APK and I will probably take advantage of that, but I think it's still something to consider.)\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nSet up Godot for Android 1-click deployment\nVerify that a one-click deploy with \"Signed\" turned ON works ok\nUn-check the \"Signed\" setting\nPerform an Android one-click deploy\nNote the deploy fails (silently; the command window shows that the install failed due to no certificate):\n\n```\nInstalling into device (please wait..): Google Nexus 7\nrunning cmdline: \"H:/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb.exe\" \"-s\" \"00ea7f8d\" \"install\" \"-r\" \"C:\\Users\\med\\AppData\\Roaming/Godot/tmp/tmpexport.apk\"\n3338 KB/s (7730287 bytes in 2.261s)\n        pkg: /data/local/tmp/tmpexport.apk\nFailure [INSTALL_PARSE_FAILED_NO_CERTIFICATES]\n\n```\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\nAny project that can deploy to Android.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4837/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4759","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"9D41:01FB:1179B8C:2511BC9:59D69D66","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=235>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=233>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"cc1c6f2785a6c3d8809761f178824ef4\"","status":"200 OK"}}
