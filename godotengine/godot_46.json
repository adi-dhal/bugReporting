The camera limit is set to 0,0 as the top/left.  When the project is first started, the button and dialog appear in the expected areas.

working on the CanvasItemEditor, I figured out that a lot of keyboard \"shortcuts\" were hardcoded into the code, and thus could not be modified in the editor preferences. \r\n\r\nThe problem is the following: the `ShortCut` node (scene/gui/input_action.h) has an` is_shortcut(const Ref<InputEvent> &p_event)` function to test whether or not an InputEvent corresponds to the recorded shortcut. However, there is no way to test is the keys in the shortcut are currently pressed or not (like with `Input::get_sigleton()->is_key_pressed()`), unless using something like in `spatial_editor_plugin.cpp`:\r\n```\r\nint key_left = ED_GET_SHORTCUT(\"spatial_editor/freelook_left\")->get_shortcut()->cast_to<InputEventKey>()->get_scancode();\r\nif (input.is_key_pressed(key_left)) {\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe problem is that this code does not handle shortcuts with key modifiers (ctrl, alt, shift) :/. Also, shortcuts using mouse buttons instead of keyboards key would not work. \r\n\r\nI can see those two solutions to the problem:\r\n- We implement a `is_pressed()` function in the ShortCut interface.\r\n- We implement an `is_key_pressed_with_modifiers()` function in the `Input` interface\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10497/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10496","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10496/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10496/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10496/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/10496","id":251575387,"number":10496,"title":"Shader language: incomplete swizzle support","user":{"login":"curly-brace","id":1852811,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1852811?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/curly-brace","html_url":"https://github.com/curly-brace","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curly-brace/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curly-brace/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curly-brace/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curly-brace/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curly-brace/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curly-brace/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curly-brace/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curly-brace/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curly-brace/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-08-21T07:46:46Z","updated_at":"2017-08-21T07:53:51Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"you can't make a vector larger then initial using swizzle (but should)\r\n\r\n```glsl\r\nvec2 test2 = vec2(0.0, 1.0);\r\nvec3 test3 = text2.xxx;
