system or device - Godot version:**\nWin7 x64 - [2.1alpha / 00bfdc834bc028e7c15e939662a72353250d00f3]\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nIf you set up any physicsbody to be raypickable, the picking will work correctly if the mouse_mode is set to `visible`. If you set the mouse_mode to `mouse_mode_captured`, it'll send the raypick as if the mouse _wasn't_ captured.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n1. Create any physicsbody, and make sure \"raypick\" is enabled\n2. Create a script, and connect the physicbody's `input` signal so you know when you're picking it\n3. Create a camera and point it so that the rigidbody is on the screen\n4. Toggle between captured/visible verifying that the picking is wrong\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very

system or device - Godot version:**\nLinux and Godot 2.0.3\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nDid an earlier test of look_at() with a camera and it works fine. Now I'm trying to get a KinematicBody to look at another KinematicBody and it's returning an error: \"Condition det == 0 true\" in \"core/math/matrix3.cpp.\" \n\nIssue seems to have resolved now, though. But might happen again so I'm posting this report.\n\nWent into the IRC to get help and the users were baffled.\n\nHow I resolved it was to create a testcube and test it with that. It worked to my amazement. Then I wired it back up to look at the other KinematicBody and moved the body (before it was right above the looking at body) and it seemed to work. Did more tests including moving it back above the looking at body and they all worked, no error. \n\nEdit: Even though it works now, I notice that when the object moves past and above the looking at object it jitters as it passes.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nWire up a KinematicBody to look at something directly above it perhaps using look_at().\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\n[move_test.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/308100/move_test.zip)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5130","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5130/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5130/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5130/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5130","id":159513325,"number":5130,"title":"Visible

Unfortunately godot editor is perhaps the only one, which do not remember its position and size betwin sessions, so it is necessary to move and resize it, to desired location and size, every time its started.\n\nIf someone is frequently jumping betwin projects - **it turns into unnecessary additional burden, where one instead of concentrate on main problem - plays endlesly with ordering windows on screen every fiew minutes or even several seconds**. Believe me - after 100 times it might begin to be a hassle and start destroying all the fun.\nAll just because, while godot do all the complex stuff, it forgets about the most basic one, like - to remember its own position and size.\n\n**Enhancement proposal**: \nGodot **Editor should save its window position and size when window is closed (destroyed)**,\nand **restore its position and size when window is opened (created)**,\nso it always appear at expected and usual for the user placement,\nsaving him from playing around with windows ordering instead of working on main project.\n**Its very small adjustment but same time a huge improvement, time and distraction saving feature**.\n\nAs for me, it could be enought if Editor just save and restore its window position and size, and thats it.\nThere is no need for any additional settings for it.\n\n_But perhaps there might be someone who would like to have it saved per project.\n(where setting could be saved into project's engine.cfg file instead of editor's config file)\nBut... imho, saving it per project might preserve unnecessary hasle since there might be many different placements betwin projects and again, when jumping betwin projects it might enforce one to move and scale editor's window and the end.\nTherefore IF saving it per project could be implemented too, it could be reasonable to add [checkbox] in editor settings, like [save editors window placement per project] to give user option to chose if he want editor to just remember its placement globaly for all projects, or save it along with project so every project might have its own different window placement._\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5114/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5113","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5113/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5113/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5113/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5113","id":159299128,"number":5113,"title":"Double events (Discussion)","user":{"login":"ret80","id":233268,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/233268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ret80","html_url":"https://github.com/ret80","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ret80/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ret80/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ret80/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ret80/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ret80/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ret80/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ret80/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ret80/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ret80/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279097162,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/discussion","name":"discussion","color":"ee77ee","default":false},{"id":279097562,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:android","name":"platform:android","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279097519,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:ios","name":"platform:ios","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":390419563,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/pr%20welcome","name":"pr welcome","color":"d93f0b","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":14,"created_at":"2016-06-08T23:27:55Z","updated_at":"2017-04-10T17:25:54Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Then came the first day:\nI make a version for Android and it worked cross:\n\n```\nfunc _unhandled_input(e):\n    if e.is_echo() || get_state() != S_LIVE || !e.is_pressed():\n        return\n\n    if (e.type == InputEvent.MOUSE_BUTTON && e.button_mask & (BUTTON_LEFT | BUTTON_RIGHT)):\n        _next_dir()\n        game.add_score(1)\n```\n\nAnd I was glad.\nThen came the second day:\nThen they gathered for IOS and found that it no longer works.
