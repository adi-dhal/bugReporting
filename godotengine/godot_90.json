of what was mentioned in #5965, though somewhat related to #3637 as well. Also, will obsolete all \"Add scripts to tiles\" issues if implemented. \r\n\r\n### Why put whole scenes in tilemaps? \"We already have scene instancing for that!\"\r\n\r\n**TL;DR** - using instanced scenes instead of tiles in various places bloats the scene tree and makes for a bad workflow. Instancing scenes to replace certain tiles in `_ready()` is just a manual implementation of the feature which has been somewhat popular so far.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUnlike #9179, this time I can't say that scene instancing is hacky. Actually, what we currently have has worked for ages without having any problems. Sadly, the current workflow is a bit unwieldy...\r\n\r\nAs an example, here is how a typical Minilens [level](https://github.com/KOBUGE-Games/minilens/blob/eed8ef3325704e7ff9c94a2451de2783e2a5a087/levels/first_contact/level_11.tscn) looks like, shown alongside the scene tree:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5276727/27148519-43455e22-5149-11e7-83e5-149d31cfaa67.png)\r\n\r\nThe typical problem here is that it is hard to find a specific box, flower, bomb pickup, etc., unless you select it from the viewport. And if you want to move a part of the level slightly... you have to move all the respective boxes/flowers/pickups along.\r\n\r\nAs an additional bugger, you have to remember to turn on \"use snap\" and then \"configure snap\" to use the proper tile size. That, or calculate the positions of the various nodes by hand.\r\n\r\nSome people have solved this problem by having some tiles which get replaced in `_ready()` with their real versions. This makes a slight performance hit on load times as well as being too much boilerplate. I think having it in core is going to ease things for a lot of people.\r\n\r\n### Ok, let's say the workflow can be probably improved, what do you propose?\r\n\r\n* Some tiles of the `TileSet` should be able to have a `PackedScene`.\r\n* When a tile of such a scene type is encountered, we don't draw anything in its place, but add a separate node with the instance (which has owner = null, so that it won't be saved).\r\n* If the instanced child does not extend CanvasItem, just spam the console with errors. Or maybe check if it has a `set_position` method, and call it.\r\n\r\nOptional features:\r\n* In case the child gets removed from the tree for whatever reason, we just do a `set_cell(x,y, -1)` behind the scenes.\r\n* Provide a `move_cell(from_x, from_y, to_x, to_y)` / `move_cellv(from, to)`, which would move the instance, instead of recreating a new one at the other position. This might have an additional flag that would cause it not to call `set_position` on the child again.\r\n* Allow scene tiles to also have a texture, so that they can be free to move around without leaving holes (note that this can be done by just having a Sprite as the root of the scene, but then it won't benefit from Tilemap's batching). This might somewhat conflict with the first optional feature.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9180/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9179","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9179/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9179/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9179/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/9179","id":235932983,"number":9179,"title":"Animations in TileMap","user":{"login":"bojidar-bg","id":5276727,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5276727?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg","html_url":"https://github.com/bojidar-bg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279097162,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/discussion","name":"discussion","color":"ee77ee","default":false},{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-06-14T16:11:56Z","updated_at":"2017-06-15T13:22:29Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Part of what was mentioned in #5965, putting as separate issue for maintainability.\r\n\r\n### Why animations in tilemaps? \"We already have AnimationPlayer for that!\"\r\n\r\nYes, we do. Actually, we can already make animations with tilemaps, as evidenced by [Minilens](https://github.com/KOBUGE-Games/minilens/blob/eed8ef3325704e7ff9c94a2451de2783e2a5a087/main/level_holder.gd#L43-L45):\r\n```gdscript\r\nfunc _process(delta): # Move the acid\r\n\tacid_animation_pos = acid_animation_pos + delta\r\n\tif(acid_animation_pos > acid_animation_time):\r\n\t\tacid_animation_pos = acid_animation_pos - acid_animation_time\r\n\tlevel_tileset.tile_set_region(2, Rect2(64-64*acid_animation_pos/acid_animation_time,0,64,64))\r\n```\r\nUnfortunately, this is very hacky, and also forces update of _all_ quadrants, as opposed to just quadrants which have the animated tile.\r\n\r\n### Ok, so what's the idea?\r\n\r\n(terminology note: a `TileMap` is made up of **cells**. Each cell is of a specific type, know as a **tile**.)\r\n\r\nAfter discussing the issue with @ArcFutahito on IRC, we agreed on the following idea:\r\n\r\n* Tiles of the `TileSet` should be made animateable somehow (probably via `SpriteFrames`)\r\n* The whole tilemap's animation should be turnable on/off, and probably it should have a speed parameter like `AnimationPlayer` and `AnimatedSprite` do. It might be useful to seek it as well.\r\n* We don't need to be able to turn animation for a specific *cell* or *tile* on/off -- it is way too specific to be put in core, and performance would suffer as well (feel free to provide examples for when it might be useful)\r\n* All cells with the same tile id would get the same frame at a given point in time; a cell added later would still get the same frame as other cells with the same tile.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAbout the implementation, I'm still not sure if we should keep cells with animations on separate canvas items, as to save some redraws. So, this is also something we might want to discuss.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9179/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":7}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9178","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9178/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9178/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9178/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9178","id":235915687,"number":9178,"title":"Fix/improve TouchScreenButton (2.1)","user":{"login":"RandomShaper","id":11797174,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11797174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper","html_url":"https://github.com/RandomShaper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-06-14T15:17:32Z","updated_at":"2017-06-15T10:57:16Z","closed_at":"2017-06-15T10:39:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/9178","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9178","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9178.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9178.patch"},"body":"- Refactor touch acceptance logic so the same is used whether passby is enabled or not.\r\n- Remove the check for visibility during input handling as it should never fail; instead using now an ERR_FAIL_COND() just in case since we have been checking for that so far.\r\n\r\nFixes #9159.\r\n\r\n__NOTE;__ I've done this pretty quickly.
