Such a file would also make the feature portable because it doesn't need a project setting that would require projects to be intrusively modified.\r\n\r\nContext: in 3.0, I am developing a GDNative plugin with an src/ folder for the C++ project. During development, compilation generates lots of files with various extensions, .obj among them, and Godot thinks they are meshes and chokes at importing them. Because the import is automatic it happens as soon as I focus Godot, which is really annoying. This is one reason why I think a `.godotignore` feature would be useful.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8461/reactions","total_count":12,"+1":12,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8460","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8460/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8460/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8460/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8460","id":222853057,"number":8460,"title":"Clarification
