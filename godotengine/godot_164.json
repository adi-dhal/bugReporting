experienced on Windows 7 and Windows 10 - Godot version 2.1\n\nDescription: When Godot has a certain gdscript somewhere within \"res://\", it crashes when this file is either previewed in the file browser, opened, or saved within Godot. This problematic .gd file is attached to this issue. A way to prevent the crash is to mess with lines 30 and 31:\n\n```\nvar x = 200 * cos(2 * PI / (0))\nvar y = 200 * sin(2 * PI / (0))\n```\n\nIf either of these lines are deleted, Godot won't crash. If either of these lines are changed enough, Godot won't crash. It makes no sense to me why the editor seems to crash only in the case that these lines are present in a file.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Download the attached file\n2. Change the file extension from .txt to .gd\n3. Create a new Godot project\n4. Put the downloaded .gd file in the Godot project's root directory\n5. Open the project\n6. Open the .gd file within Godot\n7. Try to save the .gd file a number of times\n\nGodot should crash at some point during this process.\n\n[Game.txt](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/557495/Game.txt)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6947/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6946","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6946/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6946/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6946/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6946","id":185799951,"number":6946,"title":"Invalid
