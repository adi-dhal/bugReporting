Here's the link:\n\nhttps://copy.com/7ooRIxKja7wY\n\nIf this is a matter of it being an \"intended bug\" because I'm using it incorrectly, then a check to find concave polygons and abort before a crash would probably be a good idea. Or perhaps it could be automatic, and go with a trimesh collision mesh if there are concave lines, and a convex mesh otherwise (though, informing the developer might be a good idea).\n\nI have:\n\nAMD

getting some unexpected results when trying to use a regular Label's \"percent visible\" property. Whether set through code or through the interface, it doesn't interpret the value correctly. Instead of mapping the visibility to the values 0.00-1.00, it maps it to something more like 0.00-0.80. So at \"80%\", the label is actually 100% visible. I've posted it on [the forum](http://www.godotengine.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=643&sid=afb17797a4ef6e2dafead706c4b129e1) but it appears to be a bug.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Create a label. Give it any text. Length doesn't matter\n2. Set the \"percent visible\" field to 0.0 and note how all the text is invisible, per expectations.\n3. Set the field to 0.9 and note how the entire label is visible.\n\nThe actual \"100%\" point seems to lie somewhere around 0.70~0.85 for most tests I've tried. Here's a gif to demonstrate it.
