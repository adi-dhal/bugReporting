I tested this theory by converting the `SpatialMaterial` from the `viewport_quad` to a `ShaderMaterial` and adding [this conversion ](https://github.com/glslify/glsl-gamma/blob/master/in.glsl#L11-L13) to the albedo like:\r\n\r\n```glsl\r\n...\r\n\tALBEDO = albedo.rgb * albedo_tex.rgb;\r\n\tALBEDO = pow(ALBEDO, vec3(2.2)); // toLinear\r\n...\r\n```\r\nWhich gave me this result:\r\n![https://i.imgur.com/mefeeFw.png](https://i.imgur.com/mefeeFw.png)\r\n![https://i.imgur.com/BMsq5Gh.png](https://i.imgur.com/BMsq5Gh.png)\r\nCamera as close as possible to only show the 2D part.\r\n\r\nAnd this seems pretty close and good enough for the 98% of the uses for this (when talking about 2D on 3D) But you kinda have to know how to fix it and most people won't know.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n1.

This makes sense for neatly rotatable tiles of uniform size. But in some use cases, you want objects that are off-centre, and you still want them to have collision details.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1318345/31046141-f064dd3e-a636-11e7-9453-9f3854774f0d.png)\r\n- My bookshelf model is deliberately off-centre so that it can be placed against a wall (it only takes up half a grid-space along one axis)\r\n- If I want to add a StaticBody with a BoxCollisionShape, I can't offset them to cover just the geometry (because they don't export their transforms, they are locked to the centre of the tile, or grid space)\r\n- I can centre its pivot in my modelling program, then I can apply the StaticBody and BoxCollisionShape. This will give me correct collision geometry, but my object is then forced to be in the centre of the tile/grid-space (which is undesired).\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1318345/31046153-20d1a8f8-a637-11e7-9efb-709edb698490.png)\r\n- Ideally, the children of the MeshInstance nodes should retain their transforms when a .meshlib is created from a scene.\r\n\r\nThis effect is exaggerated if you imagine the bookshelf is a painting, or something thin that you would typically mount on a wall, not in the centre of a grid space.\r\n\r\nYou can also imagine a half-tile object in a grid space would be affected by this
