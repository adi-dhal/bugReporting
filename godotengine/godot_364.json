you loop an animation and use the continuous interpolation mode, after the last keyframe in a track, things get wonky.

If you have a keyframe earlier, it'll count down from that keyframe back to the first keyframe in the track.\n\nI've never seen a loop behave like this before. I tested this in v0.99.3653-pre-beta from January 3rd, and get the same behavior, so this isn't a regression, by the look of it.\n\nHere's a video showing how to reproduce this, in case it's not clear what I'm saying: http://youtu.be/Ti0OBfWR4a8\n\nI can't see why anyone in their right mind would WANT this behavior to happen automatically, since they could simply keyframe back down at the end of the animation. But those of us who don't want this behavior don't have any option unless we want to insert keyframes for EVERY value... Which is simply making things far more tedious than need be. Even extending the animation a bit, inserting a duplicate keyframe there, then setting the length back to the desired value doesn't prevent this from happening (keyframe past length is just ignored, as would logically be expected).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/959/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/958","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/958/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/958/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/958/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/958","id":51615940,"number":958,"title":"added

This issue is as far as I know only windows related. At least I tested under windows and linux, but under linux it doesn't occur.\n\nWhen saving files in godot, godot creates .tmp files of the original, and then deletes the old file and renames the tmp file to its original name. At least the procedure should run similar as described.\nBut it happens relatively often that you remain the tmp file and that file is not renamed back to its original name. \nThis can result in a few bugs/issues. On the one hand resources cannot be loaded. You start your game with F5 and suddenly it abords the game because some resources cannot be found resulting in nil objects.\nSuddenly missing script files. And I now even discovered that the Editor settings can be completely deleted. I always wondered why my project list sometimes got deleted and I needed to reset all android export settings under windows. I now looked into the godot folder under app data and discovered that this tmp issue caused the problem. This error got me really mad xD\nSo, this saving issue can happen everywhere where godot saves files.\n\nI would call this bug critical for a release, because new users would never know what happens there. It took me a very long time to discover that you just have to rename the tmp files back to the original name and everything works. Especially for a 1.0 release this should work!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/956/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/955","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/955/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/955/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/955/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/955","id":51548326,"number":955,"title":"\"Save Scene\" while in script tab loses scene changes","user":{"login":"romulox-x","id":7547356,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7547356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/romulox-x","html_url":"https://github.com/romulox-x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romulox-x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romulox-x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romulox-x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romulox-x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romulox-x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romulox-x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romulox-x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romulox-x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romulox-x/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-12-10T11:37:30Z","updated_at":"2015-01-03T04:43:37Z","closed_at":"2015-01-03T04:43:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If I make changes to my scene in the 2d editor, then change to the script tab, and make changes there, saving (either by ctrl-s or Scene->Save Scene) only saves the script changes.
