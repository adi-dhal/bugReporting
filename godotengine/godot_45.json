This is problematic when setting up the lighting for a scene, as you often want to toggle objects/lights on and off when assembling a scene. \r\n\r\nCurrently you have to delete an object(or constantly fiddle with material or light settings) to know exactly what the result will be. Note that you can also see the hidden objects in the giprobe reflections (reverse vampire effect!)\r\n\r\n![hidden_objects_gi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7741669/29546686-20b02a06-8739-11e7-8577-51843962a001.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n- hide objects(mesh, light, mesh light) within a giprobe setup.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\n<!-- Optional but very welcome.

node -> mouse filter\" doesn't seem to be working properly. I believe that \"stop\" and \"pass\" mouse filters should behave differently- \"stop\" should accept and stop input event and \"pass\" should accept the input event and pass it further, so that the Control nodes which are below could access the same event until it is either stopped somewhere or simply just becomes unhandled event.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nPlace two button nodes with some overlap; when user clicks on the overlapping area, only one button(the top one) gets pressed.\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\n<!-- Optional but very welcome. You can drag and drop a zip archive to upload it. -->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10510","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10510/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10510/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10510/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10510","id":251738116,"number":10510,"title":"Fix y axis for set_window_position on OS X","user":{"login":"marcelofg55","id":10578225,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10578225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelofg55","html_url":"https://github.com/marcelofg55","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelofg55/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelofg55/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelofg55/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelofg55/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelofg55/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelofg55/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelofg55/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelofg55/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelofg55/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097780,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:osx","name":"platform:osx","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279098255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:porting","name":"topic:porting","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-08-21T18:39:47Z","updated_at":"2017-09-07T21:45:04Z","closed_at":"2017-08-22T06:10:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/10510","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10510","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10510.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10510.patch"},"body":"Same as #10505 but for 2.1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10510/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4948","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"A85F:572B:CEFC11:1B56602:59D69A51","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=46>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=44>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"85035b033d8f1ff7add401709605ff65\"","status":"200 OK"}}
