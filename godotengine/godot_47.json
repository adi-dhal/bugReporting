There was a new bug exposed due to the bug fix in #8144 where the directory would never actually switch on *nix systems in the DirAccessUnix::change_dir function, but now does as intended.\r\n\r\nSo, the cause of the problem is that OS::_ensure_data_dir would create the data directory such as \"/home/nathan/.godot/MyGodotProject\" and then change to it and keep it as the current directory. The previous behavior is that it would stay in the current directory such as \"/home/nathan/Projects/MyGodotProject\". So, in my particular case it was looking for the C# assembly in the .godot user data directory instead of the project directory as it was correctly doing before.\r\n\r\nWhat this code does is caches the current project directory location and then switches back to it once the data directory is created. This maintains the previous behavior while not reintroducing the previous bug. If the desired behavior is that the current directory be the project's directory in the editor then this fix should be the correct one. If the desired behavior is that the data directory should persist as the current directory and that the project directory should be switched to when loading C# assemblies or other files, then this is not the correct fix.\r\n\r\nHere's a 6 minute screen recording in case you would like to see the issue in action.\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8iCxych7qVBdTlFVDNnc3BrNGc\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10469/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10468","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10468/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10468/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10468/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/10468","id":251456718,"number":10468,"title":"improvement suggestions for AnimatedSprite","user":{"login":"puppetmaster-","id":10463138,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10463138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/puppetmaster-","html_url":"https://github.com/puppetmaster-","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puppetmaster-/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puppetmaster-/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puppetmaster-/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puppetmaster-/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puppetmaster-/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puppetmaster-/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puppetmaster-/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puppetmaster-/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puppetmaster-/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-08-19T23:52:54Z","updated_at":"2017-09-03T20:41:05Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\r\nWindows 7, Godot Engine v2.1.3.stable.official\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nI worked a lot with animatedSprite in my last project and this has bothered me all the time:\r\n\r\n1) not having the possibility to flip a frame horizontally/vertically\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10463138/29490584-f8a15dcc-8540-11e7-8ae7-055e92a3a974.png)\r\n2) could not delete a frame with [delete] key (node get deleted)\r\n3) after pressing on new animation button the animation text (New Anim) is not selected and cant be directly renamed\r\n![animatedsprite_improvments](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10463138/29490676-7507386c-8543-11e7-9a58-89c5d293bcdc.gif)\r\n\r\n4) selecting a AnimatedSprite node in tree doesn't show automatically SpriteFrames gui on the bottom when node has a SpriteFrames ressources (slow down the flow to quick edit an animation) (#10923)\r\n\r\nWhat I'm not sure:\r\n\r\n5. when animation only has one frame do I need to turn loop off or does the engine handle this automatically?\r\n\r\n6. does it has an old discussion on having [Insert Empty (Before)] and [Insert Empty (After)]?\r\nIts confusing and I need to consider with button I need to press.\r\nHaving only an [Insert Empty] and move the frame with [Up] or [Down] would be enough.\r\n\r\n7.

I'd really like to see in Godot, too. One of the things that I noticed I liked most is how smooth and satisfying the camera movement in the 3D editor feels as opposed to Godot (especially when using freelook). \r\n\r\nIt's hard to explain, but there seems to be some sort of intertia or weight to the camera (similar to stabilizers in graphics programs) that allows for much more precise and less abrupt camera movement than in Godot. I played around with some of the editor settings in Godot but couldn't achieve the same effect. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can't provide a gif for comparison, but maybe people who have used UE4 before (or possibly also Unity) can comment on this. Would it be possible to implement something like camera inertia for the camera in the 3D editor? I think this would greatly improve its usability.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10463/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10462","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10462/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10462/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10462/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/10462","id":251448431,"number":10462,"title":"Folder should be created automatically upon creating a project","user":{"login":"homer666","id":27100585,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/27100585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666","html_url":"https://github.com/homer666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homer666/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-08-19T20:37:06Z","updated_at":"2017-09-25T05:36:14Z","closed_at":"2017-09-25T01:44:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Godot will create your project in whatever directory you have set, meaning that you must create the directory you want your project to reside in beforehand.
