This is the only way I've found for this to work correctly.\r\n\r\nWithout this PR, the algorithm usually pushes the kinematic body up to the solid side of the platforms. It's noticebale, for instance, in the kinematic character demo. And if you try to fix that by setting a low or even close to zero \"max depth\", your character falls through the platform.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, the mentioned demo as well as the 2D platformer demo keep working as usual, but you can improve them by setting a lower value for the \"max depth\" on their OWC platforms. Namely, you can fix the noticeable push in the KC demo with a \"max depth\" of 1.\r\n\r\nThat is, now \"max depth\" has this meaning (which I think was always its intended purpose): _how deep at most a body can be with respect to this one for the physics server to force it to a non-overlapping position_.\r\n\r\nAlso, I've changed the explanation of the one-way collision direction in the docs to reflect how it is actually used by the engine and I've cleared up the usage of the \"max depth\" property.\r\n\r\n@reduz, please have a look and tell me if it's correct and if I have to port it to 3.0. Also note the description and actual meaning of the one way collision direction were inverted, so you can decide how to define it for 3.0.\r\n\r\nThis might also helps fixing some of the issues people are having with KBs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8714/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8713","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8713/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8713/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8713/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/8713","id":227798298,"number":8713,"title":"get_overlapping_bodies gives outdated results","user":{"login":"cosarara97","id":1713879,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1713879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cosarara97","html_url":"https://github.com/cosarara97","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cosarara97/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cosarara97/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cosarara97/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cosarara97/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cosarara97/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cosarara97/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cosarara97/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cosarara97/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cosarara97/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279097162,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/discussion","name":"discussion","color":"ee77ee","default":false},{"id":283518839,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"ffbbff","default":false},{"id":370471880,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:physics","name":"topic:physics","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-05-10T20:18:48Z","updated_at":"2017-05-13T23:29:31Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:** v2.1.3.stable.official running on arch linux\r\nHappens on android too.\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nThe Area2D method get_overlapping_bodies returns outdated results.
