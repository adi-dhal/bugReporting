edit**:_\r\nTested on 2.1.2, and 2.0. and 1.1 \r\n\r\nSymptoms of this issue are visible on this gif:\r\n![exportdefaultvaltest](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6129594/24290611/df8f3474-1085-11e7-80e9-b56049db2ae8.gif)\r\n\r\nReproduction steps:\r\n1. Create new script\r\n2. Attach it to a node\r\n3. Create new exported variable _integerVariable_ in the script with default value = 5\r\n4. Save the script, look at the inspector _integerVariable_ will have correct value of 5\r\n5. Do NOT change exported variable in inspector.\r\n6. Change default value inside the script.\r\n7. Value in inspector is not updated.  \r\n\r\nsidenote: after doing some test on older Godot **I don't know if this is a bug** or design decision. As far as I remember to have that kind of 'automatic update' behavior you always needed to create subscene in a separate file and update variables in inspector of this subscene.\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently (as of 2.1.2), attempting to change the default value (in the code editor) of an exported variable leaves every instance (Including the original instance, which has thrown me off several times when editing) with it's previous default value. \r\n\r\nI can understand the reason for this (ensuring the variables of previously edited instances are not overwritten) but I would prefer if instead of this implementation, you could just set an exported variable as \"Changed\" (with the revert icon appearing) on an instance to ensure it isn't overwritten and overwrite every instance with an \"Unchanged\" value whenever the default value is changed","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8127/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8126","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8126/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8126/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8126/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/8126","id":216587690,"number":8126,"title":"Input

I read some interesting techniques here http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/BartlomiejWronski/20140129/209609/The_future_of_screenspace_reflections.php, I guess ReflectionProbes are designed for this but I couldn't get a difference with them)\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1311555/24227711/8532b7f6-0f6f-11e7-85c3-03518deb1bd1.png)\r\nI was able to set a metalness of 2, which gave a more contrasted look. However it gets clamped to 1 so I guess it was not really allowed?\r\nAlso transparency seems to be incompatible with reflections, they disappear as soon as \"transparency\" is checked in the material.\r\nIs there a way to make reflections \"blurry\"? I tried roughness but it has no effect.\r\n\r\nHere is a video of the water plane: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbkvuQWgnkg&feature=youtu.be\r\n\r\nAnother one of a demo I'm making, not focused on reflections but still noticeable artefacts https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-doDosEA3E\r\n\r\nThe project: \r\n[ScreenSpaceReflections.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/863419/ScreenSpaceReflections.zip)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8119/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8118","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8118/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8118/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8118/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/8118","id":216256299,"number":8118,"title":"Gizmos lose their colors","user":{"login":"Zylann","id":1311555,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1311555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann","html_url":"https://github.com/Zylann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-03-23T01:09:40Z","updated_at":"2017-06-13T21:37:52Z","closed_at":"2017-06-13T21:37:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Tested on Godot 3.0 master c37fad650f92845a6f59740fea2fea1b46f56db1\r\nWindows 10 64 bits \r\n\r\nSometimes gizmos get coloured in very transparent black, making it hard to tell which axis is which.

on Godot 3.0 (not latest, a few days old)\r\nWindows 10 64 bits\r\n\r\nIn some cases, Vector3.angle_to produces NaN angles, even if the vectors are normalized.\r\nBy narrowing down the issue:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nreal_t Vector3::angle_to(const Vector3 &p_b) const {\r\n\r\n\treturn Math::acos(this->dot(p_b) / Math::sqrt(this->length_squared() * p_b.length_squared()));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI found it's because the value sent to `Math::acos` is sliiiigtly greater than 1, to the point that when printed in GDScript, the console just says `1`, but x > 1.0 outputs `true`.\r\nI added a workaround function in my project that performs a `clamp`, and it worked perfectly.\r\n\r\nSorry I don't have a small repro project, as this happened to me by doing some specific 3D camera movements in this test project: https://github.com/Zylann/godot_flyer_test\r\nSee this line of script where my problem occurred: https://github.com/Zylann/godot_flyer_test/blob/master/flyer.gd#L48\r\nIt happened by starting the game, doing small mouse movements, and then I got a few occurrences of NaN.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8111/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8110","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8110/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8110/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8110/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/8110","id":216228164,"number":8110,"title":"Built-in
