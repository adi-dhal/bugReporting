[this forum thread](http://www.godotengine.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=503&start=10#p2546) for some additional information and observations that other people have made about this problem. I recommend closely reading from the post I linked above and onwards (rather than backwards), because the forward posts try to focus in on and pinpoint the problem with Godot a bit more than previous posts.\n\nI can't speak for everyone, but it seems like many GNU/Linux users are hitting up against this issue, and it's reproducible in _every_ demo that accepts input (i.e. Platformer, Platformer 3D, Kinematic Collision, Pong, etc.).\n\nIn short, the engine's Input key states sometimes fail to update (this can be observed by comparing the output of `Input.is_key_pressed(key)` to the actual state of your keyboard, for instance). **The input event dispatcher itself does not fail; all InputEvents for pressing and releasing keys seem to be properly dispatched even when key states stick, so if the user wants to reinvent the wheel by recreating her own input mapper instead of using Godot's, she can.**\n\nThe failure to update is not random, but predictable; the following pattern appears to be consistent:\n- If you release one key and press another at the same time, neither key will change states within Input (even though the InputEvents are properly dispatched). I've noticed that some key combinations are far more difficult to reproduce this with than others.\n## A simple demonstration\n\nHere's a little keyboard I wrote using GDScript to visualize the engine's key states for better testing this issue:\n![keyboard demonstration](http://i.imgur.com/RadFIko.png)\n\nHere's the code:\n\n``` python\nextends Node2D\n\nconst KEY_SIZE = 58\nconst KEY_PADDING = 5\n\nvar keyboard = [\n    {\"offset\": 0, \"keys\": \"`1234567890-=\"},\n    {\"offset\": KEY_SIZE*1.5, \"keys\": \"QWERTYUIOP[]\"},\n    {\"offset\": KEY_SIZE*1.75, \"keys\": \"ASDFGHJKL;'\"},\n    {\"offset\": KEY_SIZE*2.25, \"keys\": \"ZXCVBNM,./\"}\n]\n\nclass Key:\n    extends Node2D\n\n    const IDLE_COLOR = Color(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)\n    const PRESSED_COLOR = Color(0.8, 0.6, 0.5)\n\n    var key\n    var label\n\n    func _init(key, x, y, width, height):\n        set_pos(Vector2(x, y))\n        self.key = key\n\n        label = Label.new()\n        label.set_text(key)\n        var label_offset = KEY_SIZE/2 - label.get_line_height()/2\n        label.set_pos(Vector2(label_offset, label_offset))\n        add_child(label)\n\n        set_process_input(true)\n\n    func _draw():\n        var color\n        if Input.is_key_pressed(key.ord_at(0)):\n            color = PRESSED_COLOR\n        else:\n            color = IDLE_COLOR\n\n        var offset = KEY_PADDING\n        var size = KEY_SIZE - offset*2\n        draw_rect(Rect2(offset, offset, size, size), color)\n\n    func _input(e):\n        update()\n\nfunc _input(e):\n    print(OS.get_unix_time(), \" \", e)\n\nfunc _ready():\n    set_process_input(true)\n    for row in range(keyboard.size()):\n        var r = keyboard[row]\n        for key in range(r.keys.length()):\n            generate_key(r.keys[key], key, row)\n\nfunc generate_key(key, x, y):\n    var key_x = keyboard[y].offset + x*KEY_SIZE\n    var key_y = y*KEY_SIZE\n    add_child(Key.new(key, key_x, key_y, KEY_SIZE, KEY_SIZE))\n```\n\nSay I'm pressing the **L** key:\n![keyboard demonstration](http://i.imgur.com/vZ9HAcX.png)\n\nIf I press the **K** key and release the **L** key at the same time, the key states still think I'm just holding down **L**, even though I'm actually holding down **K** on my keyboard:\n![keyboard demonstration](http://i.imgur.com/vZ9HAcX.png)\n\nThis is a log of the InputEvents that were dispatched (along with unix timestamps as I shifted from the **L** key to the **K** key:\n![log from keyboard demonstration](http://i.imgur.com/DwPzZ5j.png)\nAs you can see, the Input events dispatched properly even though the Input key states failed to update!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/440","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/440/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/440/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/440/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/440","id":34007239,"number":440,"title":"drawing
