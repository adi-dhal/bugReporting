But with C++, we need to re-compile our game on every changes we made, and also need to compile export template before hit Export button. By using GDScript, we'll most likely get fast made Game with \"acceptable\" performance. Instead, we'll wait some minutes even hours to compile and re-compile for a higher performance game.\n\nStill, both have the same downside, non-optimized binary size. A simple \"HelloWord\" game will have similar size as a simple \"Jumper\" game.\n\n**B.] Compiling for Release Mode with AutoConverted GDScript to CPP**\n\nAs usual, coding the game using GDScript, fast prototyping as we have every changes done in second. And, whenever we think our game ready to be released, we are provided Two ways of Exporting.\n\n1) Just like what Godot have now. There is export template. Hit Export button and the engine Start exporting. A short description could be added though, for example: \"Fast Exporting. No need to spend some minutes or hours.\"\n\n2) Compiling for Release. A Short description: \"Slow Exporting. Could take some minutes or hours. Be warned\". In this mode, the engine automatically convert all GDScript files into CPP and gather all resources first and then start Compiling (when it comes to Android, the engine calling Android NDK Toolchain).\n\nThis way, we could have 3 advantages:\n- Make games faster (thanks to GDScript)\n- Optimized binary size\n- Having C++ performance (thanks to something like gdscript_to_cpp conveter and \"compiling for release\" mode).\n\n**C.] Where the idea comes from?**\n- Cocos Studio. It has Two modes for exporting project:\n  1) Using pre-made libraries. The libraries are static. No need to compile on every changes. Take a few minutes. Bigger binary size and less performance if we use JavaScript as Scripting Language.\n  2) Compiling the whole project for release. Takes minutes or hours (depend on machine rig), but well optimized binary size and performance.\n- GameMaker Studio. It also has Two modes for exporting project:\n  1) Export using Non-YYC (default mode). This way, GML (GameMaker Scripting Language) packed together with other resources and interpreted at runtime. Fast Export, but less performance.\n  2) Export using YYC (YoYo Compiler). This way, GML and other related resources is converted into CPP by YoYoCompiler and then compiling to .so file done by Android NDK Toolchain (of course if we target Android Apk). Once the game compiled, there is .ini file that said something like, LLVM. Probably it's kind of modified LLVM Compiler. Long Export, but the performance much better.\n- Unity3D. Two modes for exporting project provided:\n  1) Using C# (Mono C# Compiler)\n  2) Using IL2CPP (Intermediate Language To CPP. Convert Mono C# Compiler to C++ Compiler).

I just need comments on how hard to implemnt this and that, ideas on implementation, plans, details, anything. I hope I'm not alone interested in this, but any attempt \nto start discussion failed so far, so I'd like to try this way.\n1. More user friendly bone transform editing and animation. Should allow quaternion\n   and XYZ angles, scale, transform, animation of the fields, from GUI. Being implemented for everything else, it is just natural to have this for bones too. That would allow to animate skeletons from Godot\n   without having to calculate transformation matrices by hand\n2. Bone constraints - we need to be able to limit bone rotation, this is requirement for 3.\n   Can be done in a way similar to Blender, just rotational constraints with angles, on XYZ and quaternion\n   coordinates, global and local.\n3. Inverse kinematics. We have this feature for 2D, but 3D one is a bit more complex,\n   requires 2 targets, the IK target and pole target to be sloved right. This can be implemented in GDScript now, but done this way is messy without having 0.1 and 1.\n4. Ragdoll - this can be implemented in many different ways, including via 1. plus applied constraints, with forces applied to IK targets and bases. But better use some fast published solution, which\n   are available a lot.\n\nMy opinion about this is that the start should be with 0. and 1. but I might be wrong here,\nas I'm not professional in this field, but I'm really curious and interested, and have an attitude.\nAny

If `keep_world_transform` is true, it would maintain its transform relative to scene root ( so `get_global_transform()` before the call and after would return the same transform ).

Though if there's enough community interest (and if the library is actually good and adaptable to our API), I guess it could be added in the main tree too.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4005/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4004","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4004/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4004/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4004/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4004","id":139944610,"number":4004,"title":"Any non-latin symbols make debugger swear","user":{"login":"BeLuckyDaf","id":7478442,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7478442?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeLuckyDaf","html_url":"https://github.com/BeLuckyDaf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeLuckyDaf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeLuckyDaf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeLuckyDaf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeLuckyDaf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeLuckyDaf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeLuckyDaf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeLuckyDaf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeLuckyDaf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BeLuckyDaf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-03-10T16:40:37Z","updated_at":"2016-03-10T16:50:06Z","closed_at":"2016-03-10T16:50:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device:**\nWindows 10\n\n**Issue description** what happened, and what was expected):\nI live in Russia, so I do have russian keyboard layout and if I write some russian letters or whatever it will not appear in the editor, and i won't be able to erase it or backspace.
