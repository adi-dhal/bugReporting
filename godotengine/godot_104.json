What does it mean to follow a method? I've tried mentally replacing \"follow\" with \"subscribe\", but that doesn't make sense either. \"Monitor\" might also work, provided it can't possibly be confused with the synchronization construct.\r\n\r\nAnd then...what does it mean to animate a method?\r\n\r\nLastly there are a couple spelling mistakes -- s/consequitive/consecutive/ and s/begining/beginning/).\r\n\r\n---\r\nI'm really just trying to figure out what this method does.

I'll do a quick PR in a minute that at least exits the application nicely if things fail. It does give a nice message in the logs that it can't find any files to load but the exception error threw me off.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is a missing setting or something that hasn't changed yet in the iOS implementation but the code looking for the pck file to open is using the executable name. In the XCode template that is godot_opt.iphone which ends up in godot_opt.pck being opened, not data.pck. Simply renaming the file allowed it to load the game files.\r\n\r\nSo it boots up now, but we're still getting errors. In initializing the GLES rendered it's failing at some point:\r\n```\r\nGLES3: max extensions: 19\r\nGLES3: max ubo light: 102\r\nGLES3: max ubo reflections: 113, ubo size: 144\r\n\u001b[1;31mERROR: initialize: \u001b[0m\u001b[1mCondition ' status != 0x8CD5 ' is true.

My guess is that the opengl context isn't being instantiated properly, we're probably missing a few more hints, as it is not able to create the render target. I'll keep stepping through the code and see if I can trap where the GLES3 initialisation fails, I've found XCode to be really unfriendly when debugging if it isn't the one compiling the
