There is a lot of methods for translating and looking_at etc. but imagine this simple scenario:\n1. An enemy with an Area2D is walking around the scene, listening for objects\n2. Player enters the Area2D, a script receives a proper signal\n3. The enemy should now raycast to check if the player is really visible\n4. RayCast2D requires a local-space cast coordinate, proper calcuation would be `aimPoint = to_local(PlayerObj.get_global_pos())`\n\nSince there is no function like that the dev has to figure out some matrix math to properly do this, basically wasting time and probably writing buggy code.\n\nMy suggestion is to implement four new methods:\n\n```\nVector2 Node2D.to_local(Vector2)\nVector2 Node2D.to_world(Vector2)\nVector3 Spatial.to_local(Vector3)\nVector3 Spatial.to_world(Vector3)\n```\n\n`to_local()` transforms a vector to local coordinate system - eg. `to_local(get_global_pos()) -> (0,0)`\n`to_world()` transforms a vector to global coordinate system - eg. `to_world(Vector2(0,0)) -> =get_global_pos()`\n\nThis would help a lot with game logic that does some more analytic work for other purposes than \"looking at\" (or at least would enable things like \"look at the object, but try to predict it's destination in 50 ms\" -> `look_at(Target.to_world(velocity*prediction_time)))`.\n\nGarry's Mod's Wiremod Expression2 language had those two little methods on vectors, thanks to those I never really had to do any matrix math at all.

scene tree to visual script board. \nUnfortunately there is problem with context switching. While for me relatively fast drag always works fine,  it seems on other devices it's very hard to drag node on VS sheet.  I was talking about this with @TheoXD here: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6075#issuecomment-238337278 He was surprised it's even possible, and he have real problems with doing this, so it's probably somehow resolution/fps/system dependent.\n\nI think **context should be switched only when 'mouse_press_up' event occurs** inside scene tree

At the moment there is no way to use keyboard to faster find what we are looking for:\n![manyfunc](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6129594/17480413/17004da6-5d78-11e6-906c-908310aebc68.png)\n\nIt would be a lot better if we could use fuzzy matching to find this function faster. It would be even more better if we could do this from inside VS editor, **without** looking for Inspector tab (**which is not visible** anyway when we are working with VS in fullscreen). \nI imagine it could look more or less like this:\n![fuzzy_function](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6129594/17480506/84b50a44-5d78-11e6-8759-d39a17190f8e.png)\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n\n**Link to

horizontal left to right positioning of VS nodes. \nThere is nothing wrong with that, but basically every VS script will also need to allow position nodes under each other (lets say new line), currently representation for this scenario is not very readable:\n![topdown1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6129594/17479646/ee788884-5d73-11e6-8bf2-d86e85ae8359.png)\n\n![topdown2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6129594/17479650/f1ae57a4-5d73-11e6-88a9-4394f7cf5565.png)\n\nI think there are three ways of solving this,\n1. Have lines connection that acts a little more like bezier curves:\n![betterlines](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6129594/17479813/0c84a032-5d75-11e6-9884-4daf51af6113.png)\n2.
