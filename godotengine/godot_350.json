don't know if it is a bug or a missing feature, but it would be cool if `EditorScenePostImport` allowed to insert new children nodes into the scene.\n\nI wanted to create some children nodes from inside the EditorScenePostImport script when importing a collada scene.\n\nWhen I add AnimationPlayer nodes, or a simple TestCube into the scene, it will not appear into the final scene-tree displayed into the editor.\n\nHowever if I do a `parent.print_tree()` from inside the post-import script, it will diplay the new child into its tree ... so it's like if new children were removed by a POST-post-import filter .... \n\nOn the other hand, `node.create_convex_collision()` works fine and adds successfully children nodes to MeshInstances nodes.\n\nIs it bug ? Is it related to the \"update logic strategies\" system which prevent adding new nodes ? is it me ?\n\nhere are minimal test-case files : https://github.com/UsernameIsAReservedWord/bug-EditorScenePostImport\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1374/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1373","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1373/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1373/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1373/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/1373","id":57749601,"number":1373,"title":"Fixed compilation error on OSX","user":{"login":"mhojlund","id":5418387,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5418387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhojlund","html_url":"https://github.com/mhojlund","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhojlund/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhojlund/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhojlund/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhojlund/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhojlund/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhojlund/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhojlund/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhojlund/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhojlund/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-02-15T22:35:57Z","updated_at":"2015-02-16T02:30:12Z","closed_at":"2015-02-16T02:30:12Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/1373","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/1373","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/1373.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/1373.patch"},"body":"When I tried to compile the editor on OSX, it failed on the modified line.
