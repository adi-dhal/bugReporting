trying to coordinate two or more paths for my camera movement on my shmup, when one path is finished, another start at the same position, this is for different camera speeds, but I noticed a noticeable skip on scroll when the camera change to another path.\nNow working on an animation I found the reason, **It's seems that the baking intervals put the first point after the first interval**, for example if you has a straight line as path:\n![Image of line](http://i.imgur.com/7vkUZN8.png)\nOn blue is the path drawing on godot\nOn orange is the baked path generated by godot with an interval of 5, notice how the orange line start at 5, same has baked interval value.\nThe follower of the path, follows the baked orange line and skip 0-5 portion from origin because for some reason the baking algorithm doesn't start by add a bake point on the origin\n\nHere is an image of a missile sprite which doesn't start at origin with unit offset on 0 using a baked interval of 5, look at the position too, is 5 on Y axis and should be 0, so is happening what I described on top\n![Image of check_this_five](http://i.imgur.com/HuswEyt.png)\n\n**How to reproduce?**\n1. Create a Path 2d and his curve\n2. Create a visible follower for the path\n3. Set the baked interval of the curve to 5 or more for example.\n4. Set the Unit Offset of the follower to 0 and look how doesn't start at origin position of the path\n\nHere is a project ready for debug this

with new info**\n**Operating system or device:**\nPC1 (notebook)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/gMPJ4gu.png\nPC2 (Desktop)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ZUI6s9S.png\nPC3\nIntel® Core™ i5-3320M CPU\n64Bit Zorin OS 10 (Linux)\n4gb DDR3 Ram\nIntel-4000 Graphics \n\nGodot >= 2.0.1\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nI developed a method for old school color swap with shaders using color palettes and a grey mask, which should be fast and has a low memory overhead.\n\nShader accept two textures:\nA Greyscale texture which is the Grey Mask\nA Palette texture where each pixel is a color of the palette (Nx1 size)\nGrey Mask has correlative colors where his RGB value represent the index of a pixel color on the palette.\nAn image which explain better the theory:\n![Image of explanation](http://i.imgur.com/IDz2Lp9.png)\n\nSo on computers with **AMD Graphics** the result is as **EXPECTED**:\nhttps://gfycat.com/ImmensePoshElectriceel\nAnd on computers with **Intel Graphics** the result is **WRONG**:\nhttps://gfycat.com/ImmediateInformalEmu\nNvidia untested\n\nNote: a visually reference of which palette gets applied to megaman on each button press is on right side, on the intel video for some reason the shader uses the wrong color for the second color of palette.\n\nThe shader code:\n\n```\nuniform texture palette;\nuniform float palette_size;\nuniform texture mask;\nvec4 mask_color = tex(mask,UV);\nvec4 output = tex(TEXTURE,UV);\nif(mask_color.r != 1.0)\n{\n    output = tex(palette,vec2((mask_color.r*255.0)/(palette_size),0.0));\n}\nCOLOR.rgba = output;\n\n```\n\nThe culprit is the `palette_size` var, this is an uniform float which represents the width of the palette texture, is updated at gdscript with an int value when is required:\noutput = tex(palette,vec2((mask_color.r*255.0)/`palette_size`,0.0));\n\nThe `palette_size` is different between Intel vs Amd/Nvidia for some reason, could be something about float precision on the GPU or int to float casting. I managed to find a work around about this issue, but is a patch, a bad one I think because a formula written on paper, should behave the same on code always. The work around is to subtract 0.001 to `palette_size`:\noutput = tex(palette,vec2((mask_color.r*255.0)/(`palette_size-0.001`),0.0));\nThis behaves the same on all desktop GPUS.\n\nMuch more detailed info about the implementation and algorithm used here:\nhttp://www.godotengine.org/qa/2935/best-colour-palettes-asking-again-cause-last-time-didnt-help?show=2979#a2979\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n- Download the project with the implementation on a computer with an Intel Graphics GPU (Updated with my last finds):\n  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/4axz8j3k359m5a1/pallete_swap_bug.zip?dl=0\n- Open it with godot >= 2.0.1 using the intel graphics, if you have a notebook with a dedicated+integrated graphic card, on amd control panel set the godot editor to Power Saving mode. Here a illustrative video how to do that:\n  https://gfycat.com/NauticalVillainousAustraliankestrel\n  For Nvidia I don't know, I don't have a computer with Nvidia at hand.\n  Also don't tested on mobile devices.\n- Press the buttons to change megaman from different palettes, look if megaman uses the 0,1,2 color of each palette (visual references from palettes on the right side of buttons)\n\nShader is on megaman sprite, the script on megaman is for texture and hud management\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4315","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4315/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4315/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4315/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4315","id":148241380,"number":4315,"title":"can't remove space key from ui_accept","user":{"login":"va-de","id":18267730,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/18267730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/va-de","html_url":"https://github.com/va-de","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/va-de/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/va-de/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/va-de/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/va-de/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/va-de/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/va-de/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/va-de/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/va-de/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/va-de/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-04-14T03:30:45Z","updated_at":"2017-03-03T15:05:31Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I am trying to remove the space key from ui_accept, but it wont work.

But as importer imports all bones, the animation will blend not only changed bones, but also unchanged ones, which lead to invalid/strange blends, like half-sitting man, etc.\nFilter allows choice which animation tracks to include in blend.\n\nI think this should be re-shufled. We need separate filter node, which gets animation in (after whatever\nnodes on its path) and gives out animation with tracks removed.\nAll other blend support can be removed from UI then.

You get better framerate!\n- Your animation can be procedurally altered during runtime - since the runtime is driving it, the programmer can layer ontop or override animations. For example you can have your player character's head turn in the direction of a specific object on the screen.\n- Your game/app uses much less HD space - smaller file size makes it much better for mobile development where file size is important.\n- You can swap body parts of your character, as the animation is running. This makes it very easy to implement an equipment system that actually affects the way your character looks or reuse the same animations an all the enemies you want in the game - while having them look different.\n\n**What other software can use this technique and export animation data to a json file?**\n- Spine 2d\n- Spriter\n- Creature\n- anime studio\n- toonboom harmony\n\n**Popular games that use it:**\n- rayman origins, rayman legends,  dragon's crown, etc etc\n\n**What open source software can do this already?**\n- Godot and Blender (via coa tools)\n\n**The problem with the json file format, the game runtime and the lack of one open standard:**\nThe three major competing applications for cut out game animation do basically the same things. However as a means to lock their users to their product, the structure of the json files they output is different. That forces game developers to have to rewrite a new run time for each of the three - that parses the data accordingly. What is worse - they put a license on their runtimes that prohibits anyone else  - who does not own the license to their software to use their runtimes.\n\n**To sum it up:**\nWe need a json file specification that is open - one that can work on all game engines without the need to purchase a license from someone.\n\nSomehow this json specification must be kept compatible in all open source editors or runtimes - so as to not have to duplicate effort to implement new runtimes for each game engine.\n\nPerhaps we need to create a new github/web page for it? One that describes the structure of the specification - and makes it easy for other developers to implement exporters/importers/runtimes.\n\nIf we coordinate this between all open source projects that have interest in exporting json animation data - all can benefit from one runtime! In return that runtime will also benefit from them as well - becoming more widely used and supported than it's proprietary counterparts.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4311","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4311/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4311/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4311/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4311","id":148116652,"number":4311,"title":"Unify

add a global function that lets us check if an instance has already been freed.\n\nI know, it's possible to avoid this situation by meticulously enforcing the order in which objects are removed from scene and object references are freed, but sometimes it would take tremendous effort to refactor the code to free the instance correctly / only once.\n\nCurrently, if an object was part of a display tree and its parent / grandparent has been freed, the object would be freed along with the parent, and a variable pointing to it would become invalid.\n\nAttempting to call any function on this instance results in:\n`Attempt to call function 'FUNCTION_NAME' in base 'previously freed instance' on a null instance.`\n\nSince the Godot runtime is able to detect this and break with an error, I assume there's a way to check if an instance pointed at by a variable has been freed or not.\n\nIt would be a very very helpful addition and could save many hours of debugging.
