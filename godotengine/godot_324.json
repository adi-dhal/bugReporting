Additionally, identifiers must not begin with a digit. Identifiers are case-sensitive (â€™fooâ€™ is different to â€™FOOâ€™).\"\n\nnot so urgent stuff(so i think):\n- Its seems that you have created 4 docking areas in each side of the main area, it would be good if there was more docking areas (in the top and bottom parts), also, it would be nice if we could move the main area directly.\n- Would be nice if we could undock the tabs of 2d,3d,Script and help, also we could undock (and dock in other docking are) the output.\n- Speaking of it, it would be nice if we could just close all those dockable elements (so if i think i will not use the 3d in a project, i could just close it and reopen it later)\n- Since now editor is becoming more configurable, we could have editor profiles. So i could use a profile more suited to using the script while i am caring the code area and another more suited to edit the nodes when i am caring about the more visual area.\n- Also, some elements (not all of then) could be undocked to a external window. (for example, the Script that is kind of independent of the rest). So we can see the two at same time if we have two screens or simple use alt+tab. (another good example to this would be the output, that would work greatly in two screens... man i need two screens :( )\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2152/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2151","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2151/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2151/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2151/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2151","id":90180768,"number":2151,"title":"Reload all scenes button in editor","user":{"login":"mikica1986vee","id":8853364,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8853364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikica1986vee","html_url":"https://github.com/mikica1986vee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikica1986vee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikica1986vee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikica1986vee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikica1986vee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikica1986vee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikica1986vee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikica1986vee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikica1986vee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikica1986vee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false},{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":283518733,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"007700","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2015-06-22T18:53:12Z","updated_at":"2016-07-21T08:52:13Z","closed_at":"2016-07-21T08:52:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"From the Facebook group discussion.\n\nPlease add reload all edited scenes button.\n\nThanks!
