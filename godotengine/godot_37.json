This node has a Sprite and Collision2D under it.  The sprite shows one of several sprites from a sprite sheet with 32x32 sprites in it.\r\n\r\nIn the editor the sprites look sized correctly, and the scale on the Sprite shows 3x3.

In the bottom image in game you see the image is much too large.\r\n\r\nWhen I set the image on the prefab node, i set the region_rect and the modulate setting, and I don't touch the scale but its too large.  I even print the scale in game and its 3x3 so I know the editor is showing me one set of scale number but rendering another. (text output on the top image)\r\n\r\nIf I set the scale in my script to say 2x2 it looks the right scale but is off center because I centered it in the editor.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10778","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10778/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10778/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10778/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10778","id":253854772,"number":10778,"title":"Remove Basis::set_scale and Basis::set_rotation_* functions.","user":{"login":"tagcup","id":16531565,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/16531565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagcup","html_url":"https://github.com/tagcup","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagcup/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagcup/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagcup/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagcup/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagcup/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagcup/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagcup/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagcup/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagcup/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-08-30T01:53:37Z","updated_at":"2017-08-30T10:45:22Z","closed_at":"2017-08-30T10:45:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/10778","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10778","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10778.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10778.patch"},"body":"Those functions were added in #8277 but they did more harm than good.

A second of sound has actually `sample rate * channels`, so our buffer_size must be equal to `buffer_frames * channels`, ref: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11048825/audio-sample-frequency-rely-on-channels\r\n\r\n\r\nLong explanation: I found about this issue while working on the surround fixes.\r\nThe calculation for the buffer_size before this PR was:\r\n```\r\nbuffer_size = closest_power_of_2(latency * mix_rate / 1000);\r\nsamples_in.resize(buffer_size);\r\nbuffer_frames = buffer_size / channels;\r\n```\r\nAnd the new one:\r\n```\r\nbuffer_frames = closest_power_of_2(latency * mix_rate / 1000);\r\nbuffer_size = buffer_frames * channels;\r\nsamples_in.resize(buffer_size);\r\n```\r\nWith for example latency=25, mix_rate=44100 and channels=6\r\nOld one:\r\n```\r\nbuffer_size = 25 * 44100 / 1000 = 1102 => closest_power_of_2(1102) = 1024\r\nbuffer_frames = 1024 / 6 = 170\r\n```\r\n\r\nNew one:\r\n```\r\nbuffer_frames = 25 * 44100 / 1000 = 1102 => closest_power_of_2(1102) = 1024\r\nbuffer_size = 1024 * 6 = 6144\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the old one gave a buffer size really small with 6 channels (it was also incorrect for 2 or 8 channels of course).\r\n\r\nNote: I've modified only alsa, pulseaudio, osx, rtaudio and wasapi drivers, the rest needs to be

neither body A nor body B are set.\r\n\r\nMake 2D joints be handled like their 3D counterparts, which adds the fixes to them while also removing duplicated code.\r\n\r\nFixes #2383.\r\n\r\n~~__UPDATE:__ Commit added that fixes a removing-while-iterating issue.~~\r\n\r\n__UPDATE:__ Commit added:\r\n\r\n_Remove joint freeing logic from physics servers:_\r\n\r\nSince joint resources are created by joint nodes and also they take care of freeing them, the physics server doesn't need to free bodies' joints explicitly.\r\n\r\nThe logic for clearing the constraints map/set is still relevant as there may be collision pairs and in their case its the server itself the one creating them and therefore releasing

between... a \"default\" state of the parameters to the ones in the animation. Take for example a simple rotation. If you make an animation of 360 deg. rotation, but having the first keyframe (at T0) be 90 deg. instead of 0. And say you have a second animation of horizontal looping motion, doesn't really matter. Now say we want to mix the horizontal movement with the rotation. The horizontal animation has no track for rotation. Then the mix node mixes from \"default\" state of the object (0 deg.) to the animation rotation.\r\n\r\nI think a more useful mix node would have targets for each track of the mixed in animation. Or at least have a target animation for beginning and another for the mixed in. Or there should be a way to define the global \"default\" state to transition from with the mix node instead of assuming every parameter should mix in from 0 to the animation set parameters.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to explain but check the attached project, play with the edit slider on the mix node in animationtreeplayer and check the rotation animation in animationplayer.

I propose to make it work like blender. Eg, things I found that don't make sense (some might be bugs):\r\n\r\n1. some properties are modified even if the play cursors hasn't reached the keyframe. For example, take canvas modulate, and insert only one keyframe say at second 3 and change the color to something other than white (say red). Start the game with canvas modulate color at pure white. It turns out that the canvas modulate will be red immediately, even though there's no key to change it to red at 0! The position on the other hand behaves correctly, that is if you insert a key at second 3 and there's no other keyframe before that, then the object won't move until second 3 is reached. I've only tried a handful of properties but so far the only reasonable behavior is on position\r\n\r\n2. if loop is turned on don't try to interpolate between last keyframe (before the animation finishes) and the first keyframe. Instead let's follow the blender way, so if I have a sprite that moves from left to right and only 2 keyframes, one at T0 and one at T1 and animation length of 2 seconds with loop turned on, I expect sprite to move only between T0 and T1. How it's implemented at the moment is, if loop is on, then there will be an interpolation between T1 and T0 as well (from second 1 and second 2). I think this isn't intuitive. Blender has some pretty good standards, if they do it that way they probably have a good reason why.\r\n\r\n3. would be great if we could be able to type a number in the `Transition` panel instead of just relying on the mouse to move the easing around.\r\n\r\nIf you guys can think of anything else let the discussion begin
