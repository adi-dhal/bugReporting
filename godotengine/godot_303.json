An attempt to emulate subpixel drawing failed.\n\n**Issue:**  \ndraw_line() will snap to global coordinates, but accepts local coords.  This can cause some unexpected behavior as lines snap to unexpected coordinates.\n\n**Expected behavior:**  \ndraw_line() should round() inputs rather than floor() or ceil() them.  Alternatively, if draw_line() is called for width 1 at x = 0.5, two lines are drawn at x=0 and x=1 with alpha of approximately 0.5 \\* rgba.  (I personally found alpha of pow( 1 - (x-floor(x)), 2) and pow( 1 - (x-ceil(x)), 2) to be pleasing.)  Using alpha to provide smother draw_polygon() and draw_circle() outputs would also be desired.\n\n**Example**:\n    extends Sprite\n\n   set_pos(Vector2(100.1,100)\n    var x = 0.5\n    draw_line( Vector2(floor(x), 0), Vector2(floor(x), 20) ) # line is drawn at x = 100\n    draw_line( Vector2(ceil(x), 0), Vector2(ceil(x), 20) ) # line is drawn at x = 102\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/Fz1qM2I.png)\n**Image explaination:**  \ndraw_line() is used twice for each 10% interval of the bar length with alpha scaled to represent how close the line is to the floor(x) or ceil(x).  The third line has a 1 pixel gap.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2792","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2792/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2792/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2792/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2792","id":117003585,"number":2792,"title":"Spatial editor gizmos are affected by their parent node's scale","user":{"login":"DerRidda","id":3391055,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3391055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerRidda","html_url":"https://github.com/DerRidda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerRidda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerRidda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerRidda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerRidda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerRidda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerRidda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerRidda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerRidda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerRidda/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279128044,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/confirmed","name":"confirmed","color":"66dd66","default":false},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":15,"created_at":"2015-11-15T16:55:29Z","updated_at":"2016-03-23T12:32:01Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"As the title suggests.
