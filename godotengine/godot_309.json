Enemy was created with \"New Inherited Scene\" option, with the base choosen as Actor. In enemy scene I added another scene with model (mesh/asset). \nNow when I open Actor scene I cant delete it's nodes.\n\nQuick steps to reproduce problem:\n1. Open \"Actor.xscn\" from sample project\n2. Try to delete CollisionShape node.\n\nSample project: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/168251/godot/some/issues/NewSceneSystem2.7z\n\n**UPDATE:**\nJust like @WriterOfAlicrow noticed scene inheretance is not needed to reproduce this. Just save your scene reopen it and you will not be able to delete it's nodes.

However:\n-  Bitmasks were already available using `export(int, FLAGS) var bitmask`. As far as I can see, there is no difference between the two, and having duplicate functionality seems like a bad idea to me. This change deletes the duplicate.\n  When this pull request is dealt with, I'm also going to update the `export var` section of the GDScript doc page to avoid this kind of confusion in the future.\n-  The `multline` hint doesn't use the default syntax which has the actual type followed by the all-caps hint: `export(String, MULTILINE)` versus `export(multiline)`.\n  This change adapts the the multi-line export hint to the established format.\n\nI'm hoping to get these changed while they're not yet part of a stable release and people using the release builds start using them.\n-  In addition, this change also adds exporting real numbers with easing hint: `export(float, EASE) var takeiteasy`.
