first choice, that's for every node that have an equal on 2D.\r\nThat's not a big issue, just usability.\r\nSolutions that I think:\r\n1- When you choose a 2D node, change the search to a 2D preference;\r\n2- Make so that you can get the 3D nodes disappear;\r\n3- When creating a project you could make a selection between a 2D or 3D project.\r\n4- When using the 2D tab and add a node, it
