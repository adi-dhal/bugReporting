My suggestion would be to add a property to EditorSettings for custom arguments.\r\n\r\nI would do the pull request for this issue, just need to know from where we actually want to get the custom arguments.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7346/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7345","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7345/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7345/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7345/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/7345","id":196829137,"number":7345,"title":"HTTPRequest retrieves corrupted file with error","user":{"login":"Zylann","id":1311555,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1311555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann","html_url":"https://github.com/Zylann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-12-21T02:13:55Z","updated_at":"2017-03-30T14:13:42Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Tested on Godot 2.1.1, Windows 10 64 bits\r\n\r\nI wanted to test the HTTPRequest node to download an image, with the following script:\r\n\r\n```gdscript\r\nextends Button\r\n\r\n\r\nonready var _request = get_node(\"HTTPRequest\")\r\n\r\n\r\nfunc _ready():\r\n    connect(\"pressed\", self, \"_on_button_pressed\")\r\n    _request.connect(\"request_completed\", self, \"_on_request_completed\")\r\n\r\n\r\nfunc _on_button_pressed():\r\n    print(\"Doing request...\")\r\n    _request.set_download_file(\"the_thing.png\")\r\n    _request.request(\"http://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_static/docs_logo.png\")\r\n\r\n\r\nfunc _on_request_completed(result, response_code, headers, body):\r\n    print(\"Request completed \", result, \", \", response_code)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe request completed with response 200 but with code 1 RESULT_CHUNKED_BODY_SIZE_MISMATCH.\r\nAnd this error appeared in the console:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR: DVector<unsigned char>::resize: Condition ' mem.is_locked() ' is true. returned: ERR_LOCKED\r\nAt: c:\\projects\\godot-builds\\godot\\core\\dvector.h:365\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this a bad use of the node or is it a bug?\r\n\r\nThe image file was successfully created, but was corrupted.

That and it is quite annoying in games (especially those involving exploration) when you want to crank the FoV up enough to see the ceiling (or just feel like you aren't using a bad pair of binoculars) but can't do so without having jarring distortion near the edge of your screen.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7339","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7339/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7339/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7339/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7339","id":196754516,"number":7339,"title":"Remove extraneous line in .po reader, which caused it to disregard first line","user":{"login":"bojidar-bg","id":5276727,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5276727?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg","html_url":"https://github.com/bojidar-bg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-12-20T19:13:01Z","updated_at":"2017-03-30T10:40:00Z","closed_at":"2016-12-23T14:54:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/7339","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7339","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7339.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7339.patch"},"body":"Fixes #7337","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7339/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7338","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7338/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7338/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7338/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/7338","id":196692798,"number":7338,"title":"Improved \"remapping\" for localized resources -

Maybe we need to localize just the titleScreen and the mainText font.\r\n\r\nWe might then have this project structure:\r\n\r\n```\r\nres/\r\n\timages/\r\n\t\ttitleScreen.png\r\n\t\tenemySprite.png\r\n\t\tplayerSprite.png\r\n\tfonts/\r\n\t\tmainText.tres (a font resource)\r\n\taudio/\r\n\t\t...\r\n\tlocales/\r\n\t\tde/\r\n\t\t\timages/\r\n\t\t\t\ttitleScreen.png\r\n\t\t\tfonts/\r\n\t\t\t\tmainText.tres\r\n\t\tes/\r\n\t\t\timages/\r\n\t\t\t\ttitleScreen.png\r\n\t\t\tfonts/\r\n\t\t\t\tmainText.tres\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe idea is that, whatever needs to be changed in a locale, we add the changed version inside the correct subfolder inside the locales folder. Then the engine will use it to **_\"override\"_** the default file.\r\n\r\nThis way there is no need to manually setup mappings one by one. Instead you just copy the files into place and you're ready to go.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nGodot already runs every resource file access through ```PathRemap``` singleton defined in ```path_remap.cpp```, specifically the ```get_remap``` method. This is actually very powerful as even script files (.gd) and scene files (.tscn) and everything else goes through this method.\r\n\r\nWhat is needed is to only add additional functionality to ```get_remap``` to detect whether a corresponding resource file exists in the corresponding localization folder and return the path if it does.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Upon further thought, this can actually be implemented by using PathRemap itself. What is needed is to just scan the locales path at startup to see what files are in there and setup remappings for them using PathRemap.add_remap which already has a p_locale parameter.\r\n\r\n## Folder location\r\n\r\nIf this is to be implemented, one thing that might need to be discussed is where should the 'locales' folder be / should it be named 'locales' and should it be configurable?\r\n\r\nNote: In my old engine, the engine supported mounting folders virtually, so what I did was just mount the correct locale folder on top of the resources folder so that the localized resources would override the other ones.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7338/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7337","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7337/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7337/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7337/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/7337","id":196632362,"number":7337,"title":"Error parsing .po file from poeditor.com (internationalization, localization)","user":{"login":"chanon","id":357737,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/357737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chanon","html_url":"https://github.com/chanon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chanon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chanon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chanon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chanon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chanon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chanon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chanon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chanon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chanon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":10,"created_at":"2016-12-20T10:06:40Z","updated_at":"2016-12-23T14:54:02Z","closed_at":"2016-12-23T14:54:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"After adding .po file exported from poeditor.com to translations in project settings, this is output on console:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR: :1 Unexpected 'msgstr', was expecting 'msgid' while parsing:\r\n   At: core\\io\\translation_loader_po.cpp:107\r\nERROR: Failed loading resource: res://localization/A_Project_English.po\r\n   At: core\\io\\resource_loader.cpp:218\r\n```\r\n\r\ncontents of A_Project_English.po:\r\n```\r\nmsgid \"\"\r\nmsgstr \"\"\r\n\"MIME-Version: 1.0\\n\"\r\n\"Content-Type: text/plain;

system or device - Godot version:**\r\nOS X Yosemite 10.10.5,  Godot 2.1-stable, Xcode 7.2.\r\n\r\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\r\nI am not able to create fat binary for iOS.\r\nIn docs http://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/reference/compiling_for_ios.html there is an instruction\r\n\r\n> $ scons p=iphone tools=no bits=32 target=release\r\n> $ scons p=iphone tools=no bits=64 target=release\r\n> $ lipo -create bin/godot.iphone.opt.32 **arm64** bin/godot.iphone.opt.64 -output bin/godot.iphone.opt.universal\r\n\r\nSo I renamed the godot.iphone.opt.arm files I got after compilation accordingly, but lipo errors with\r\nfatal error: \r\n\r\n> /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/lipo: can't open input file: arm64 (No such file or directory)\r\n\r\nWhen I try to correct the typo and add -arch before arm64, to indicate the architecture of the input file:\r\n`lipo -create bin/godot.iphone.opt.32 -arch arm64 bin/godot.iphone.opt.64 -output ./bin/godot.iphone.opt.universal`\r\n\r\n>\r\nI get error: \r\n> lipo: specifed architecture type (arm64) for file (./godot.iphone.opt.64) does not match its cputype (12) and cpusubtype (9) (should be cputype (16777228) and cpusubtype (0))\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**: I additionally checked `lipo -info godot.iphone.opt.64` and it shows that it's armv7 architecture?! I am sure I did compile it with bits=64 option.\r\n\r\nI also tried -arch arm64v8 and that ended with similar error.\r\n\r\nI assume there is an error in docs, or there is a bug with compiling 64 bit version of iphone template.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate if someone push me in the right direction how to compile fat binary for iOS.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7329/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7328","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7328/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7328/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7328/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7328","id":196292659,"number":7328,"title":"Register
