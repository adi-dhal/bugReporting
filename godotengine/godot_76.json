developers of godot game engine,\r\n\r\nThanks for your hard working with the open source game engine. Godot is really a good game engine. I love the engine and I think all developers would love it after using it. Unfortunately, most game developers in China do not know the existence of this excellent engine.\r\n\r\nWe (some godoters in china) are tring to share the engine with others. A lot of developers joined us to try the new engine. The group could be called as the Chinese community and it is growing up.\r\n\r\nBut there always problems when we share godot with others:\r\n1. The official site is blocked by the evil fire wall in some area.\r\n2. The official site and documentation page is too slow to open in some area.\r\n3. People are poor of english like me to understand the advantages of the engine and documentations.\r\n\r\nTo solve these problems we setup a translated website here:\r\nhttp://godot.studio\r\n\r\nWe hope we can get support from the official godot community.\r\nCould you please redirect the domains below to our site to make us likes more official so we could be more confident to share with others.\r\n\r\n* cn.godotengine.org\r\n* zh.godotengine.org\r\n\r\nAnd maybe add a link in the official site.\r\n\r\nThanks for your
