Same with an empty environment: quad is white, lines are black.\r\nIt's fairly minor though, because using `shader_mode unshaded;` let you output the color directly, bypassing shadows.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1311555/30943849-1bb397ea-a3f4-11e7-86c0-0ead28db2877.png)\r\n\r\nShader:\r\n```\r\nshader_type spatial;\r\n\r\nvoid fragment() {\r\n\tALBEDO = vec3(1,1,1);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nProject:\r\n[LineColorShader.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/1339070/LineColorShader.zip)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11645/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11644","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11644/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11644/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11644/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/11644","id":261154400,"number":11644,"title":"There is no \"parent folder\" button in project manager browser","user":{"login":"Zylann","id":1311555,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1311555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann","html_url":"https://github.com/Zylann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279097162,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/discussion","name":"discussion","color":"ee77ee","default":false},{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":283518733,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"007700","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-09-28T00:05:50Z","updated_at":"2017-09-28T09:07:16Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Godot 3.0 master\r\n\r\nThere is no way to go to the parent folder when browsing for a folder to create a project.

I am trying to implement an undo system in my application. At first I thought that using setget on all values that I want to revert upon undo would be ideal, but I quickly found out that there is a flaw in this logic- I cant use a single function to do it.\r\n\r\nI want to do something like this:\r\n```\r\nvar layerVisible = true setget storeUndoStep\r\nvar layerPosition = Vector2(0,0) setget storeUndoStep\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsing setget to call a function that stores the old value to an array, every time a value is changed.\r\nThe problem is:\r\n\r\nSetget's function needs to assign the new value, you cant just grab the old value before it's changed. You have to also assign it in the function - this makes it impossible to reuse the same function on multiple variables. You have to create a separate storeUndo function for every single variable that changes. Is it possible to use setget only to trigger a function, but let godot write the new value without doing\r\n`value = newvalue `\r\ninside the setget function?\r\n\r\nmy plan for the undo system is:\r\nundosteps = [[all values undo step 1],[all values undo step 2],[all values undo step 3]...]\r\n\r\nSo on each undoable value change, use set get to append all current values array to the undosteps array\r\n\r\nPerhaps I should use the get function?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11631/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11630","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11630/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11630/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11630/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/11630","id":260929899,"number":11630,"title":"rotate

The default depth function is lesser or equal, but by overriding this, you can create some potentially interesting special effects. For example, you could have a two pass material with the second pass being a flat shaded colour using the greater-than depth function so that it can appear as a silhouette when obscured by geometry.\r\n\r\n![depth](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12756047/30890630-ed10ee7a-a325-11e7-993f-d88a8a97a2d3.png)\r\n\r\nThere is already a flag in materials to outright disable depth testing, and this PR might make that redundant, but I've decided to leave it for now.\r\n\r\nThere's  also an important limitation of this PR which I feel needs to be addressed in a separate issue. Right now, the renderer only batches two render lists, one for opaque and one for translucent objects, with the translucent list being rendered last. Since materials using the greater-than operand needs to always be rendered AFTER what it is being rendered behind, the only current way to handle this is make sure that the material using the greater-than operand is marked as translucent, so that it will render after all the opaque objects have already been rendered. This is not ideal since you don't have much fine-grained control, and translucent objects obviously are marked to not further contribute to the depth buffer. A way to solve this issue would be to provide more fine-grained access to the order in which objects are rendered, maybe some kind of ID to ensure a particular group of materials are always rendered after another group. This actually should be very easy to implement, but does probably require some discussion on the best way to go about it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11621/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4985","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"A84F:6E5E:47DF02:A7090F:59D699C0","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=9>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=7>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"f12b685c3f160b6f1335bf447332305f\"","status":"200 OK"}}
