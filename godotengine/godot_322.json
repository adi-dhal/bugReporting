the title says. Currently, it seems that Godot does not properly support multi-material objects so we have to split them in Blender before exporting. The issue though is that you have to join them back up if you need to make further edits to the level or object in question.\n\nThe solution would be a checkbox in the _Better Collada_ exporter (along with the Godot Export manager) to automatically split objects by material during the export process, which would simplify and speed up level creation. I decided it would be a good time to request that since the focus right now is on usability.\n\nIf you can take a look, thanks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2224/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2223","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2223/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2223/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2223/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2223","id":92530244,"number":2223,"title":"IMPORT:: New meshes introduced into scene lose their name","user":{"login":"Ace-Dragon","id":10081256,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10081256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ace-Dragon","html_url":"https://github.com/Ace-Dragon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ace-Dragon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ace-Dragon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ace-Dragon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ace-Dragon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ace-Dragon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ace-Dragon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ace-Dragon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ace-Dragon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ace-Dragon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279128044,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/confirmed","name":"confirmed","color":"66dd66","default":false},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":283518733,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"007700","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":5,"created_at":"2015-07-02T02:33:40Z","updated_at":"2016-06-28T15:11:05Z","closed_at":"2016-06-28T15:11:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"To test...\n\n---\n1.

But still, having multiple devices sending out axis events can impact performance quite a bit.\n\nAccording to callgrind most of the work comes from `call_group()` in `SceneTree::input_event()`  \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2218","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2218/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2218/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2218/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2218","id":92085426,"number":2218,"title":"Tool access to object's property list","user":{"login":"WalasPrime","id":11784263,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11784263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalasPrime","html_url":"https://github.com/WalasPrime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalasPrime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalasPrime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalasPrime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalasPrime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalasPrime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalasPrime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalasPrime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalasPrime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalasPrime/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":283518839,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"ffbbff","default":false},{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":5,"created_at":"2015-06-30T12:56:24Z","updated_at":"2016-07-15T10:12:46Z","closed_at":"2016-07-15T10:12:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Right now tools have a limited access to the editor (or at least the documentation isn't really descriptive about what you can do). Exports also provide a limited ability to expose functionality to the artists, so I thought what could we do to extend this in some way.\n\nI guess the easiest way to do this would be to expose the property list directly to a script. That way programmers could create GUI elements as they please, and then retrieve the values. The only issue would be saving the property values of custom elements in a scene file - export/import callbacks maybe?\n\nA trivial example:\nI'd like to allow my artist to select properties from a set of checkboxes. I will need:\n- Access to a GUI field where I could insert the checkboxes and a layout\n- A way to tell Godot what is the value of my GUI fields for saving (serialization)\n- A way for Godot to tell me what value is stored in a scene when loading, to properly setup the checkboxes (deserialization)\n\nSo I think simple callbacks for scripts could be easiest to integrate with the current state of things.\n\n```\nexport(func, int, \"_myGUISetup\", \"_mySerializer\", \"_myDeserializer\") var MyPropertyBox;\n\nfunc _myGUISetup(parent):\n    pass # Put a layout inside of the parent, put checkboxes inside of the layout\n\nfunc _mySerializer(parent):\n    pass # Read checkbox state and return an int value (defined in export) representing the state of the proprty, called on scene save\n\nfunc _myDeserializer(parent, serializedState):\n    pass # Called after _myGUISetup with serializedState if a value is saved in a scene\n```\n\nThings to think about:\n- Could animations be used with this? (I guess it depends on the implementation specifics)\n- Could plugins be used with this? (defining function names in the export might be a bad idea, maybe plugins could define a custom type for the export name `export(\"pluginCustomField\") var MyPluginProperty`)\n\nUse examples:\n- Countless really, depends on needs\n- A field allowing selection of an interpolation function with factor selection and an image rendering a plot of it\n- GDScript implementation of arrays of properties (Unity property lists equivalent)\n- Selection of a postprocessing filter to use with a preview\n- A field for file selection with a button\n- Diagnostic read-only fields showing some properties like distance to the end of a map or anything else requiring runtime calculations in the scene\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2217","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2217/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2217/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2217/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2217","id":91946511,"number":2217,"title":"PhysicsShapeQueryParameters.sphere_cast","user":{"login":"seadra","id":9574367,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/9574367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra","html_url":"https://github.com/seadra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature

this is a bit of a weird one, but the way I've been developing now has been to mock objects inside a scene as child nodes as tests.

I don't think having hindsight is a super great answer to it though as that goes against experimentation and rapid development.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2214/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2213","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2213/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2213/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2213/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2213","id":91892981,"number":2213,"title":"Area with zero gravity not works correctly.","user":{"login":"guilhermefelipecgs","id":1387165,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1387165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilhermefelipecgs","html_url":"https://github.com/guilhermefelipecgs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilhermefelipecgs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilhermefelipecgs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilhermefelipecgs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilhermefelipecgs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilhermefelipecgs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilhermefelipecgs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilhermefelipecgs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilhermefelipecgs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilhermefelipecgs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-06-29T19:52:46Z","updated_at":"2016-01-02T16:29:16Z","closed_at":"2016-01-02T16:29:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In 3D scene, I am trying to set zero gravity, but when the game start all rigid bodies are falling for 5 seconds very slowly and then they stop, they must start with no velocity.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2212","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2212/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2212/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2212/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2212","id":91873242,"number":2212,"title":"A small bug in the script editor ('\\' simbol)","user":{"login":"DimaKiva","id":11325733,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/11325733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaKiva","html_url":"https://github.com/DimaKiva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaKiva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaKiva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaKiva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaKiva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaKiva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaKiva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaKiva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaKiva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaKiva/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279128044,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/confirmed","name":"confirmed","color":"66dd66","default":false},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-06-29T18:23:42Z","updated_at":"2016-01-03T01:18:22Z","closed_at":"2016-01-03T01:18:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi.

My focus was on getting a clear and coherent design that can be flexible (fully dockable) and easy to expand in the future, and also up to date with current UX patterns on most 3d related apps. Please take a look and tell me what you think. The concept was first posted on the Godot IRC channel. Thanks to @xodene for the idea of posting the design here.\n\n![gdoto_basic_layout_concept_01](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6024473/8400490/301e7198-1de9-11e5-9071-e95583bb5827.png)\n\nAbout the design\n- Font used is Source Sans Pro, an open source font made by Adobe. This font has many weights and alternatives, including an mono spaced version, which suits perfect for scripting.\n- Current icons are from Font Awesome, a set of open source icons well known in web development. My plan is to make a complete set of custom designed icons for Godot, but this could take a lot of time, so for know I sticking with this icon set, just for testing purposes.\n- I took some freedom an added random icons and features, this helps me to see how the layout works.\n\n**Update on Oct 13, 2015**\nHi everyone! I finally got time to continue my work on the UI. Here is a quick update on the interface that include some of the features you mentioned on the comments.\n\n![gdoto_ui_concept_02](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6024473/10529944/4143bdf6-736c-11e5-86e7-a5fb465a772e.png)\n\nI also want to share with you a logo design concept I have been working on in parallel with the UI. This logo is my attempt to a fully coherent and modern Godot visual identity that initially starts with the UI design. Here I tried to simplify the current logo and make it more serious, solid and unique; as well as play well with different sizes and colors.\n\n![gdoto_logotype_concept_01](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6024473/10529960/64be9ba2-736c-11e5-8efd-8b2de84296c6.png)\n\nAs always feel free to let any feedback you want; that's best way to

right now, every variable can be one of three types...\n- Constant - it has one value and one value only\n- Dynamic - it can have its value changed to one of any type from a string to a vector3\n- Exported - this allows you to have an adjustable value for each instance of an object\n\nHowever, the downside with having to use dynamic types with all possible values that are changeable is that they are not the fastest solution around. Now I propose that GDscript gets a third main variable type, **static**.\n\nThe main benefit I can see is that it can potentially make scripts a bit faster, this will not replace the general dynamic type, but merely give the developer another way to optimize logic and make code more readable (because the interpreter would not have to check what type the value is and will throw an error if the wrong type of value is assigned).\n\n---\n\nThe syntax would work similar to how the export system works, so you could have like...\n\n```\nstatic var health = int(5)\nstatic var percent = float(12.5)\nstatic var message = \"hello\"\nstatic var rotation = Vector3(0,1,0)\nstatic var list = [0,1,2,3,4]\nstatic var blue = Color(0,0.5,1)\n```\n\nWould this be worth adding to Godot (which would depend on how much speed gain scripts can get in practice)?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2200/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2199","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2199/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2199/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2199/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2199","id":91494655,"number":2199,"title":"AnimationTreePlayer doesn't reset non-looping animations, so they are not displayed correctly","user":{"login":"slapin","id":6099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin","html_url":"https://github.com/slapin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-06-27T17:39:07Z","updated_at":"2015-12-14T19:02:01Z","closed_at":"2015-12-14T19:02:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"oneshot node in AnimationTrePlayer is provided to be able to add single animation,\nwhich played once on demand blending from existing animation to that, playing it, then blending back\nto previous animation.
