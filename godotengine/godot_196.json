If you change exported var in base scene, and at the same time you have opened third party scene which is holding inherited scenes, then exported values for those instanced inherited scenes wont be updated. \r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n1. Create BaseScene, attach a script to a scene, declare `exported var someValue = 3`\r\n2. Create InheritedScene which is based on BaseScene\r\n3. Create new 'World' scene.\r\n4. Add InheritedScene to WorldScene.\r\n5. Save\r\n6. Don't close World Scene\r\n7. Modify Exported vars of BaseScene to `5` and save it\r\n~8. Change anything in WorldScene~\r\n9. Save WorldScene\r\n10. Reopen World Scene, exported var of InheritedScene node will be 3\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\r\nVideo that demonstrates the issue: https://youtu.be/6juDGlZo2Bw\r\nSample Project to make your own tests:  (not sure if this is really needed since you still need to understand reproduction steps and perform some of them): \r\n[InheritPropertyNotUpdated.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/393308/InheritPropertyNotUpdated.zip)\r\n\r\nI'm not 100% sure if this bug qualify for fix before 2.1 but I assume It might be good thing to be considered (since updating scenes with big number of inherited scenes is painfully).
