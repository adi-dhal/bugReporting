description:**\r\n<!-- What happened, and what was expected. -->\r\nI have this script that exports a bool to the inspector.:\r\n```\r\ntool\r\nextends ParallaxLayer\r\n\r\nexport (bool) var centered = false setget set_centered, get_centered\r\n\r\nvar _centered = false\r\n\r\nfunc set_centered(v):\r\n\tif v == null:\r\n\t\tprint(\"Somehow the value is null\")\r\n\t_centered = v\r\n\tif Engine.is_editor_hint() && has_node(\"sprite\"):\r\n\t\t$sprite.centered = _centered\r\nfunc get_centered():\r\n\treturn _centered\r\n\t\r\nfunc _ready():\r\n\t\t\r\n\tprint(\"new layer\")\r\n\tprint(centered)\r\n\tprint(_centered)\r\n\t\r\n\t$sprite.centered = _centered\r\n```\r\nWhen I add an instance of the scene the checkbox in the inspector is unchecked and also shows the button to go back to the default value which shouldn't do it because I haven't modified the value:\r\n![https://i.imgur.com/57Qf1zO.png](https://i.imgur.com/57Qf1zO.png)\r\n\r\nBecause I haven't modified the value it won't get saved to the `*.tscn`:\r\n```\r\n...\r\n[ext_resource path=\"res://unlimited_parallax_layer.tscn\" type=\"PackedScene\" id=2]\r\n[ext_resource path=\"res://sprites/bg1.png\" type=\"Texture\" id=3]\r\n...\r\n[node name=\"layer4\" parent=\"bg\" instance=ExtResource( 2 )]\r\n\r\ntexture = ExtResource( 3 )\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich, when running the game, creates the following issue:\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\nSomehow the value is null\r\nnew layer\r\nFalse\r\nNull\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the debugger stops with `Invalid set index 'centered' (on base: 'Sprite')` and points to the last line `$sprite.centered = _centered`\r\n\r\nIf I check and uncheck the checkbox in the inspector the value will be saved to t he `*.tscn` and the problem will go away. The return to default icon will also be gone.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is a generic issue or a boolean only one because I haven't tested it with other types.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11665/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11664","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11664/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11664/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/11664/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/11664","id":261413411,"number":11664,"title":"Android

'right' local axis points in another direction visually.\r\nExpectation: transform.x is local2world Vector2(1,0), and transform.basis_xform(..) is local2world any vector.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nRoot: Node\r\nObject1: Node2D     <--- give some rotation\r\n    child: Object2: Node2D       <--- give some other rotation\r\n         child: Object3: Node2D <-- attach
