for a feature that would be really handy for image resizing control.\r\nA way to easily set a maximum height & width on a texture, and make the image automatically \"fit\" within that maximum size.\r\n\r\n_For example, you have a picture of x: 1000 and y: 100, and you want to make sure it can fit in a 100x100 square window, it would turn it to a x: 100, y:10 sized image in order to fit the window.\r\n\r\nThe **GDScript** equivalent would be something akin to the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Update image to prevent size to exceed max_size.\r\n# Vector2 image_size, Vector2 max_size\r\nfunc update_image_size(image_size, max_size):\r\n\t# Picture ratio\r\n\tvar ratio = null\r\n\t\r\n\t# If texture height is greater than the parent, set to fit parent\r\n\tif(image_size.y > max_size.y):\r\n\t\t# Update ratio\r\n\t\tratio = max_size.y / image_size.y\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t# Fit height to parent height\r\n\t\timage_size.y = max_size.y\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t# Fit width to match aspect ratio\r\n\t\timage_size.x *= ratio\r\n\t\r\n\t# If texture width is greater than the parent, set to fit parent\r\n\tif(image_size.x > max_size.x):\r\n\t\t# Update ratio\r\n\t\tratio = max_size.x /

image size\r\n\treturn image_size\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is something that would benefit any 2D game developer working with textures and UI. :)\r\n(Perhaps something equivalent could be made for resizing

should be tested.\r\n\r\nFor 64-bit archs (both x64 and ARM64) you have to tell NDK you want `android-21` at least. By the NDK docs, that's not a problem even if you keep your `minSdkVersion` to something lower, because you are telling it to use specific 64-bit system headers & libs and they won't be usable from a lower Android version so no binary compatibility problems will arise.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that I'm not sure how to proceed:\r\n\r\n- letting __`detect.py`__ force `android-21` for ARMv8 if the default is kept or an otherwise lower value has been passed to it (but then how to specify the default if it can only be a fixed value?, or just do the change under the hood without making it explicit --not good I think--);\r\n- telling people to manually add `android-21` or higher to the SCons command line for ARMv8 and document it (__as this PR is now you have to do that__).\r\n\r\nCloses #9628.\r\n\r\nP. S.: Maybe I have over-labeled this one. If you are from the team, feel free to remove some.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9838/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9837","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9837/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9837/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9837/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9837","id":245354102,"number":9837,"title":"Label: update minimum size when regenerating wordcache","user":{"login":"Noshyaar","id":26753932,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/26753932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar","html_url":"https://github.com/Noshyaar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noshyaar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-07-25T10:19:31Z","updated_at":"2017-07-25T12:20:14Z","closed_at":"2017-07-25T12:18:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/9837","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9837","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9837.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9837.patch"},"body":"Fix minor issue with autosize where size change doesn't update right away.\r\n\r\nStill works, no noticable adjustment loops.
