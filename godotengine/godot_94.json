found a number of issues about making terrains in Godot, be it heightmap, voxels, an engine module or a plugin, so I thought I would make a tracker to list them all:\r\n\r\nEngine limitations:\r\n- #9008 : needs texture arrays / 3D texture support in shaders, for efficient texture painting\r\n- #7786 : needs ability to do custom LoD that works in multiple viewports (currently limited to _process on a single viewport), so that the renderer doesn't chugs on culling and drawing the whole landscape\r\n- #8994, #5624 : scenes and resources saved even without changes, with a terrain it can freeze the editor for seconds and become very annoying. I disabled Ctrl+S saving the scene for that reason.\r\n- #6869 : LoD cannot update in editor because camera is not easily available. Current workaround is to use the camera provided in `_forward_spatial_input`.\r\n- [tbd] : HeightmapShape would be nice for efficient collisions, because mesh colliders are resource-hungry (althought they work decently if limited to a small region)\r\n- [tbd] : needs custom streamed resource so that a terrain doesn't have to be fully loaded in memory (only required lods around player), speeding loading times (the engine probably supports it already though, for sound)\r\n- #9134 : needs 2 additional Vector4 vertex attributes for texturing (weights and indices), in order to exploit texture arrays. The current workaround is to use UV2, COLOR or BONE WEIGHT attributes, but it limits available attributes a lot.\r\n- ~~[tbd] : indirect drawing of meshes (glDrawIndirect on renderer side, also supported in GLES3) to draw multiple subsets of mesh arrays so that we can swap LoDs really fast and reduce the amount of draw calls for all chunks of the terrain. _This also gives the opportunity to bake chunks for good, to a point they don't need any remeshing as lods update_ (current method has an exploding number of remeshing)~~ (not in GLES3 core... https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glDrawElementsIndirect.xhtml)\r\n- [tbd] : Editor: add an undo history memory limit, or use file caching, because terrain edition generates a lot of undo memory\r\n- #9571 : need to be able to update a texture partially. Editing huge textures on the CPU makes terrain editing unbearable on huge sizes (although GPU painting can be investigated to some extent).\r\n\r\nUser requests:\r\n- #3616, #8124, #8254, #4304\r\nIn several occurences my GDScript plugin was mentionned, however it has reached a point where GDScript is so slow and the API limited enough that it needs a port to C++, currently work in progress: https://github.com/Zylann/godot_heightmap_module\r\nThat module may eventually come with a fork PR of the engine in order to add missing features so everyone can benefit from them, and _things specific to terrains will stay in the module_.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9046/reactions","total_count":13,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":9}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9045","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9045/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9045/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9045/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/9045","id":233427285,"number":9045,"title":"get_collider_metadata missing function / misleading documentation","user":{"login":"ivanskodje","id":6776092,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6776092?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanskodje","html_url":"https://github.com/ivanskodje","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanskodje/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanskodje/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanskodje/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanskodje/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanskodje/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanskodje/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanskodje/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanskodje/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanskodje/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-06-04T11:18:19Z","updated_at":"2017-06-05T13:00:05Z","closed_at":"2017-06-05T12:32:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Operating system or device -
