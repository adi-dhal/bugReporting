Either imported collada scenes should not be editable or this system of integration should be disabled. I already lost couple of iterations in my projects due to reimporting.

spent a week trying to track this issue down in the past, and gave up until somebody posted about their success getting Godot to build with MinGW/GCC + Python w/ scons on Windows.  I removed and installed everything fresh again, verified configuration, and downloaded the latest source to overwrite all my tinkering with scons.\n\nWhat I find is that totally different headers are not found when their #include statement is reached during compilation.  On a hunch, I opened the task manager to watch it during the build, and sure enough it's multi-process.\n\nIt seems that headers are being included before they are done being built, which leads to a failure to compile; a race condition between the processes during the build.\n\nUnfortunately, I am inadequately prepared to track down a fix, but with some pointers I'm willing to study to do further testing and try corrective measures.  Hopefully somebody out there is already familiar with this problem.\n\nedit: I just tried building with antivirus disabled in case the file was in use by the scanner right after being built, and that's not it.  The missing header is also not present on-disk, which shows that it is actually not yet built when its #include is reached in compilation.

We want to catch the collision of the top body with the bottom body, so let's activate the Contact Monitor property of the RigidBody2D and set Contacts Reported to 1.\n\nIn the editor, the two bodies are positioned one on top of the other and the scene starts with the one on top that falls down until it reach the static body on the bottom.\n\nLet's define a script for the top rigid body:\n\n```\nextends RigidBody2D\n\nfunc _ready():\n    # Initalization here\n    connect(\"body_enter\", self, \"_on_body_enter\")\n    connect(\"body_exit\", self, \"_on_body_exit\")\n\nfunc _on_body_enter(body):\n    print(\"Top body enters in: \" + body.get_name())\n    set_linear_velocity(Vector2(0, -100))\n\nfunc _on_body_exit(body):\n    print(\"Top body exits from: \" + body.get_name())\n```\n\nThis script should display in the console window a message when the top body detects a collision with the static body on the bottom and another message when it exits from the collision area. When body_enter is triggered, the script makes the top body move up, so the two bodies should not be in collision anymore (until the top body doesn't go back down again) and it should be triggered the body_exit signal.\n\nThis works as expected but, strangely, if you set the \"Contacts Reported\" property of the top body to a value >= 2, only the first message is triggered (body_enter), as if the top body never left the collision area.\nI noticed that if you change the shape type of the bottom body from RectangleShape2D to a CircleShape2D, CapsuleShape2D, RayShape2D or SegmentShape2D, the script triggers all the signals (body_enter and body_exit) as expected with every Contacts Reported value >=1.\n\nIs this the normal behaviour? And if it's right, why body_exit doesn't trigger when Contacts Reported >= 2 ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/203","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/203/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/203/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/203/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/203","id":29486996,"number":203,"title":"Fixed #173 #157 Update parent when deleting CollisionShape2D","user":{"login":"marynate","id":3735467,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3735467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate","html_url":"https://github.com/marynate","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-03-15T06:10:28Z","updated_at":"2014-07-07T10:14:03Z","closed_at":"2014-04-05T12:55:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/203","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/203","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/203.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/203.patch"},"body":"- Force update parent when unpareting a CollsionShape2D\n  -
