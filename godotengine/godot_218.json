should keep the values for the material index slots intact (providing that no material indices were removed when editing the geometry in Blender). However, the importer still does a full overwrite and resets every value to _null_. This even happens when just re-exporting the scene with no changes.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nOpen the file, and assign a material override to all three indices on the cube. Now go to the import menu and re-import the testing2.dae. file that came with the project. Notice how every material assigned inside of Godot disappears (even though the material merge option was checked).\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\n[Merge.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/324034/Merge.zip)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5317","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5317/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5317/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5317/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5317","id":161254728,"number":5317,"title":"New loop interpolation setting doesn't get saved with the scene","user":{"login":"lonesurvivor","id":14860837,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/14860837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonesurvivor","html_url":"https://github.com/lonesurvivor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonesurvivor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonesurvivor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonesurvivor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonesurvivor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonesurvivor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonesurvivor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonesurvivor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonesurvivor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonesurvivor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279537176,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/hacktoberfest","name":"hacktoberfest","color":"00eeee","default":false},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-06-20T17:52:57Z","updated_at":"2016-06-21T15:28:14Z","closed_at":"2016-06-21T15:28:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\nWindows 7 - latest (v2.1.alpha.custom_build)\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nThe new loop interpolation setting as merged from https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4724 doesn't get saved with the scene.
