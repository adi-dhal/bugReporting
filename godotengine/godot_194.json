possible add and remove items to the \"Tools\" menu.\nThe API is based on my [initial proposal](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/1429#issuecomment-235047820) but i changed some things during the implementation:\n- I removed the `has_plugin_menu_item`(I don't added it since other functions don't have it's `has_*` counterpart).\n- All function were renamed to use `*_tool_*` instead of `*_plugin_*`, IMO this way it's clear that the functions are related to the \"Tools\" menu.\n- The `int ID` parameter of `add_tool_menu_item` was changed to `Variant ud`, used for the callback function. \n- The callback format now is `callback(Variant ud)`, which made the code simpler and more flexible.\n- The name format for the items, were changed from `\"my_category/my_item\"`/`\"MyCategory/MyItem`\" to `ANY string_Format/My Item Name` where the first slice is the item category, this way the name parameter is friendlier to translation(e.g. `\"category/\"+TTR(\"My Item Name\")` or `vformat(\"categoty/%s\", TTR(\"My Item Name\"))`).\n\nCloses

Given that I use Ctrl+S a lot more when coding than editing the scene, I remapped Ctrl+S so it saves only the script instead of the scene. But it still freezes because the script is reloaded and also the scene for some reason. So I disabled auto-reload of scripts as my last hope. But after restarting twice the nightmare comes back :s\n\nRepro:\n1) Open the editor\n2) Go to Editor Settings, Text Editor, uncheck \"Auto-reload scripts on change\" (or any checkbox, works with all of them I guess)\n3) Close the editor\n4) Open the editor, open Editor Settings, notice the options are remembered correctly\n5) Don't modify them, close the editor\n6) Open the editor again, open
