A workaround for this is to use the camera dolly zoom, which moves the camera in a direction perpendicular to the screen but uses a parameter independent of the camera's position with respect to its pivot. For that, the camera's focal length would be ideal, because it's independent of the aspect ratio, so the distance that the camera dolly is displaced would be the focal length multiplied by a constant factor, that constant factor could be configurable too.\n\n![untitled-1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1840524/5592653/d342e6ca-91ac-11e4-95f0-523b9aed1f6b.jpg)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1084/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1083","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1083/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1083/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1083/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/1083","id":53188825,"number":1083,"title":"OS
