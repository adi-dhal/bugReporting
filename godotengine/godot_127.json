I could see this being a little tricky since there's no guarantee every line will have the same height (ie, if the font is different or if an image is inserted, it might take up more vertical space), but it'd be nice if we could get either the height of a given line in the RTL, or the \"default\" line-height based on the RTL's normal-styled-text font options.\r\n\r\nFor context: I came across this while playing with the [Godot TIE addon](https://github.com/henriquelalves/GodotTIE), which adds a lot of cool functionality to a dialog-style interface. It uses labels for all its text; I wanted to try using RichTextLabels to gain access to multiple font styles, bbcode parsing, etc. But the addon uses `Label.get_line_height()`, so I was hoping to find an equivalent that works with RichTextLabel.
