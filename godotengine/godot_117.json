Working fine in 2.2\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nEDIT: It seems this issue only persists on my system, as toger5 and me found out now. The following discussion was made in the stance of thinking this is a general bug or was never implemented correctly.\r\n\r\nOn my system, I have issues with `StyleBoxTexture`s: The expand margin has absolutely no effect, and style boxes bleed out to the bottom.\r\n\r\nHave a look at the `WindowDialog` image. Remember that [the titlebar at the top and the chrome of the window expand into negative coordinates and the inner panel (\"client area\") of the windows starts at (0,0), to the confusion of some users](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/8298).\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9631152/24930511/04c84284-1f0a-11e7-9353-c469f088225d.png)\r\n\r\nWith the margins defined in `default_theme.cpp` visualized on the image, it will look like this:\r\n```cpp\r\nRef<StyleBoxTexture> style_pp_win = sb_expand(make_stylebox(popup_window_png, 10, 26, 10, 8), 8, 24, 8, 6);\r\n```\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9631152/24930700/b4fcd4a8-1f0a-11e7-8714-a6127c930fc7.png)\r\n- The red lines are the margin (10, 26, 10, 8) to cut out the 9-patch frames determining the stretching parts of the image, those are fine and not in question here.\r\n- The green area is an outset (8, 24, 8, 6), mostly used for all those tiny 2-pixel shadows around tabs, buttons (god I wish we get a flat design soon 👅 ) and in this case , as said, for the whole window chrome. They're easily configurable with `sb_expand()`.\r\n\r\nNow if I retrieve this `StyleBoxTexture` and call `sb->draw(canvas, Rect2(0, 0, 100, 100))`, you expect the areas covered by the expand margins to be drawn outside of the `Rect2`. Sadly, this is not the case on my system.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, I have a \"bleeding\" issue, styleboxes extend towards the bottom with no sense:\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9631152/24957208/432ea0b4-1f8b-11e7-9879-b8de1e27d096.png)\r\n\r\nSince I have this issue since some time, I unknowingly wrote ~~idiotic~~ hilarious `WindowDialog` drawing code like this to get that done:\r\n```cpp\r\nRef<StyleBox> panel = get_stylebox(\"panel\", \"WindowDialog\");\r\nint margin_left = static_cast<int>(panel->get_margin(MARGIN_LEFT));\r\nint margin_top = static_cast<int>(panel->get_margin(MARGIN_TOP));\r\nint margin_right = static_cast<int>(panel->get_margin(MARGIN_RIGHT));\r\nint margin_bottom = static_cast<int>(panel->get_margin(MARGIN_BOTTOM));\r\n\r\nRect2 rect;\r\nrect.pos.x = -margin_left;\r\nrect.pos.y = -margin_top;\r\nrect.size.width = size.width + margin_left + margin_right;\r\nrect.size.height = size.height + margin_top + margin_bottom;\r\n\r\npanel->draw(canvas, rect);\r\n```\r\nI was stupid enough to not query the expanded margin with `get_expand_margin_size` and used the wrong 9-patch margins, but that's barely noticable in the buggy Godot UI on my PC.\r\nAnyway, what's important is that all this ridiculous code is necessary for me draw the expanded / outset stuff really outside of the `rect` given.\r\n\r\nPS: Someone recently fuzzled around with the `Panel` content margins I believe, everything looks thinned out and ugly, on my system now. This is possibly related.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8366/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8365","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8365/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8365/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8365/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/8365","id":221045026,"number":8365,"title":"Stylebox \"bleeding\" outside to the bottom","user":{"login":"RayKoopa","id":9631152,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/9631152?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa","html_url":"https://github.com/RayKoopa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false},{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279098111,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:rendering","name":"topic:rendering","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-04-11T18:47:42Z","updated_at":"2017-04-12T13:18:49Z","closed_at":"2017-04-12T12:16:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\r\nWindows 10, AMD R9 390, 3.0 master\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nUnifying the drawing logic of Tabs and TabContainer, I'm experiencing weird `draw` results from the tab styleboxes.\r\n\r\nThe styleboxes aren't defined in any special way.

rewriting `tabs` and `tab_container` to finally get rid of old bugs and crappy behavior, and use unified logic as far as possible in the new `base_tabs`, and ran into a performance problem when implementing stuff like `get_tab_count()`, let's say for `tab_container`:\r\n\r\nThere's a private helper method `Vector<Control *> _get_tabs()` which returns all child controls which come into question for tabs (toplevel controls will not create a tab):\r\n```cpp\r\nVector<Control *> TabContainer::_get_tabs() const {\r\n\r\n\tVector<Control *> tabs;\r\n\tfor (int i = 0; i < get_child_count(); i++) {\r\n\t\t// Top level controls do not count as tabs.\r\n\t\tControl *control = get_child(i)->cast_to<Control>();\r\n\t\tif (!control || control->is_toplevel_control())\r\n\t\t\tcontinue;\r\n\t\ttabs.push_back(control);\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn tabs;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow there's another (public) method `get_tab_count()`, which basically has the following choices of implementation:\r\n- `return _get_tabs().size()`: Waste of work since the vector itself isn't needed, only the size.\r\n- Reimplementing the control iteration and just counting an index: Not much better since the requirements of controls to have a tab might change, and then multiple code places have to be changed to implement that correctly, if they are not forgotten anyway (this was actually the case in some old implementation where toplevel controls were sometimes not ignored).\r\n\r\n      int TabContainer::get_tab_count() const {\r\n      \r\n      \tint count = 0;\r\n      \tfor (int i = 0; i < get_child_count(); i++) {\r\n      \t\t// Top level controls do not count as tabs.\r\n      \t\tControl *control = get_child(i)->cast_to<Control>();\r\n      \t\tif (!control || control->is_toplevel_control())\r\n      \t\t\tcontinue;\r\n      \t\tcount++;\r\n      \t}\r\n      \treturn count;\r\n      }\r\n\r\nThen, there's another (public) method `get_tab_control()`, which also has to iterate through the controls the same way, just to pick out _one_ control in the end:\r\n```cpp\r\nControl *TabContainer::get_tab_control(int p_idx) const {\r\n\r\n\tVector<Control *> tabs = _get_tabs();\r\n\tERR_FAIL_INDEX(p_idx, tabs.size());\r\n\r\n\treturn tabs[p_idx];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm probably a C# whore, but can't this be optimized with some custom iterator over the controls? I heard this could be implemented in C++ with something like a `Vector::iterator`, **but I can't find any on Godot's custom Vector class**.\r\n\r\nAm I blind and not seeing it? Or is this not implemented yet? How should I proceed?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8353","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8353/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8353/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8353/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/8353","id":220897782,"number":8353,"title":"Only
