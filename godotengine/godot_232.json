The first is that it allows you to override the centre of mass on rigid bodies. Originally, a rigid body's center of mass would always be its origin, regardless of where collision objects were positioned. The integration should account for this and work as expected, even with joints. The reason for wanting such a feature is primarily to support ragdoll physics. It's complicated to explain why I feel this feature is nessecary, but consider how an articulated ragdoll should work. Ideally, you would want to place the rigid body at the origin point of the corresponding bone, while repositioning the collision object to better represent the length to the next bone in the chain, and then simply feed the transform data from the rigid body back into corresponding. The problem with this method without this feature is that since the objects center of mass is not of the collision shape, the center of mass will simply fall through the ground and 'drag' the rest of the object indefinetly causing it to glitch out. By using this method, this implementation can work as expected, and I've even written a simple tool which can auto calculate the center of mass from several collision objects (not included yet since I want to rewrite it as a native C++ tool). I will likely release a simple example project soon to demonstrate exactly how to set up a ragdoll with this extension in practice.\n\nSince this is a PR aimed at improving 3D ragdoll support, the second major feature of this PR is preventing buggy interactions with rigid bodies chained together in a tree. It simply does this currently by automatically setting all rigid bodies to toplevel during the integration phase. It might be worth considering feeding velocity vectors into chained rigid bodies and implementation might be worth being slightly cleaner, but in general, I consider this much safer and more reliable than the simple implementation of simply integrating with their global positions since the order in which they are integrated does not seem to be determined by their order in the tree, causing potentially unpredictable results. This aspect has also not been extensively profiled as of yet, but I don't imagine it would cause too significant of an impact and I cannot think of an alternative as of yet.\n\nThis PR should also allow ragdoll to function even when the ragdoll is programmatically scaled. This aspect of the PR would otherwise be perfectly reliable, but as pointed out in this issue #4491, there is currently a bug with internal implementation of the homegrown physics engine which causes wierd behaviour when scaling cube collision objects. Thankfully, a solution has already been identified which should solve these issues (feeding the scaling data directly into the shape construction), so hopefully @reduz or someone else can implement this fix soon, since this PR really mostly only affects the frontend of the physics system.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4912/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4911","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4911/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4911/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4911/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4911","id":157505689,"number":4911,"title":"Add

for the strange title but I have no better one in mind right now:\n\nSometimes I create a new scene and instance it in a first scene, but I later realize it is better not to have it as an external scene, but as part of the first scene. But there is currently no way of asking Godot to take a scene instance and make it so it's not an instance anymore.\n\nIn other software you would usually copy the root node, then paste it where you want it to be in the main scene, then delete the duplicate instance. But in Godot you cannot do that. You only have Ctrl+D, which only works within the current scene, not across two.\n\nIf there is a way to do that please tell me (Godot is full of hidden features :p), otherwise it should be made easier.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4903/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4902","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4902/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4902/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4902/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4902","id":157461992,"number":4902,"title":"Make dialogs translatable","user":{"login":"Geequlim","id":6964556,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6964556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geequlim","html_url":"https://github.com/Geequlim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geequlim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geequlim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geequlim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geequlim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geequlim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geequlim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geequlim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geequlim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Geequlim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":283518733,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"007700","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2016-05-30T09:07:38Z","updated_at":"2016-05-30T14:27:53Z","closed_at":"2016-05-30T14:27:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/4902","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4902","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4902.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4902.patch"},"body":"I am not sure dialogs should be translated as it is not located under tools/editor folder.

(7913e79)](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/7913e792acd656469b29fb90be1dbb7c06a855ba)\n\n**Issue description**:\nSo what happens is I am connecting two methods to a signal (exit_tree) but this methods don't get called in the order they should be called. **Keep on mind that I am connecting them within a function that gets called by a signal**. On the other hand if I wrap those two methods in one single function, it works as expected. So the problem is connecting those methods individually. \n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nVideo showing the issue in a demo: [QuickDemo-Video.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/288761/QuickDemo-Video.zip)\n\n**Link to minimal example project**:\nHere is a demo: [QuickDemo.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/288764/QuickDemo.zip)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4898/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4897","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4897/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4897/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4897/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4897","id":157421519,"number":4897,"title":"Added first batch of svg icons","user":{"login":"djrm","id":1103897,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1103897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrm","html_url":"https://github.com/djrm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djrm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279097162,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/discussion","name":"discussion","color":"ee77ee","default":false},{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":21,"created_at":"2016-05-30T02:32:04Z","updated_at":"2016-06-02T01:59:14Z","closed_at":"2016-05-30T21:27:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/4897","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4897","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4897.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4897.patch"},"body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4897/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":6,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4761","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"DDBB:572B:CFFF6D:1B7A5A1:59D69D5E","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=233>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=231>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"c469e552e8d09ad7c29ac51a81e93766\"","status":"200 OK"}}
