I use a keyboard layout called \"Dvorak - QWERTY ⌘\".  What that does is let me type in Dvorak most of the time, but whenever I press the ⌘ (command) key, Mac switches back to QWERTY for as long as I hold the key down.  That lets me use hotkeys like a normal QWERTY user, e.g. ⌘-Z to undo is the same keypress as QWERTY and makes a lot of apps easier to use.\n\nUnfortunately Godot must be detecting keys at a lower level and doesn't respect the switch back to QWERTY.  That means that to undo I have to press ⌘-/ (since in Dvorak, z is mapped to the / key).\n\nWhat's worse is that the hotkey for redo (Shift-⌘-Z) doesn't work at all even if I use the / key.  I know it's weird to use a Dvorak keyboard but it's crippling not to be able to use hotkeys like a normal user.  It does work when I switch to the plain Dvorak layout (though that makes hotkeys awkward everywhere).\n\nI'm set up to build Godot from source so if anybody could point me to the appropriate way to fix this problem, I could give it a shot?  Being able to remap hotkeys in the editor is probably the ideal solution but for now I'd settle for an under-the-hood fix.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4386/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4385","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4385/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4385/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4385/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4385","id":149859013,"number":4385,"title":"3D

Not totally unrelated var = false\n| - Unrotate children = true\n| - Rotate speed = 60\n| - Rotate timeout = 100\n| - ...\n```\n\nWe can have\n\n```\n> Script Variables\n| - Not totally unrelated var = false\n| > Rotate\n| | - Unrotate children = true\n| | - Rotate speed = 60\n| | - Rotate timeout = 100\n| - ...\n```\n\n---\n\nWith @kubecz3k we discussed on IRC about how might we do the syntax, and we ended up with the following:\n- (1) A new keyword that starts a category\n  - Pros: Allows for this issue to be closed\n  - Cons: Impossible to end a category, no nesting\n\n``` gd\ncategory rotate\nexport var unrotate_children = false\n```\n- (2) An addition to export hints\n  - Pros: Not much additional code to be written\n  - Cons: You have to retype the name of the category for each variable\n\n``` gd\nexport(\"rotate\") var unrotate_children = false\nexport(\"rotate\", float) var rotate_speed = 60\n```\n- (3) Allow variables with non-identifier names\n  - Pros: Stuff like CJK support comes naturally\n  - Cons: You have to retype the name of the category for each variable, doesn't look good at all\n\n``` gd\nexport var \"rotate/unrotate_children\" = false\n```\n- (4) Add a keyword that starts a \"category block\"\n  - Pros: Which variable is where is evident from afar, nesting of categories is supported\n  - Cons: Raises suspicion on how to get that variable... should it be via `category_name.variable_name`, or just `variable_name`\n\n``` gd\ncategory rotate:\n    export var unrotate_children = false\n```\n\n@reduz ~ Which one of the four proposals above do you like the most?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4378/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4377","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4377/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4377/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4377/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4377","id":149482605,"number":4377,"title":"Fix key events in web export","user":{"login":"eska014","id":6996191,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6996191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014","html_url":"https://github.com/eska014","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097455,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:html5","name":"platform:html5","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279098255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:porting","name":"topic:porting","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-04-19T14:44:32Z","updated_at":"2016-04-19T19:10:00Z","closed_at":"2016-04-19T19:10:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/4377","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4377","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4377.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4377.patch"},"body":"Key events in web export should now fully work in all browsers (IE11 would work too, but can't get it to start...).\n\nThis change even provides `unicode` values in key release events (in browsers supporting `key` or `char`), which other OS don't do.

The FileSystem view is stuck at \"Scanning Files\".\nThe Button.png texture file was renamed to Button_renamed.png before.\n\n**Link to minimal example project**:\n[DickTheme.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/228076/DickTheme.zip)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4374/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4373","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4373/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4373/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4373/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4373","id":149458173,"number":4373,"title":"Add preview of the Camera2D's screen boundaries","user":{"login":"bojidar-bg","id":5276727,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5276727?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg","html_url":"https://github.com/bojidar-bg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":283518733,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"007700","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-04-19T13:13:12Z","updated_at":"2016-04-19T18:48:23Z","closed_at":"2016-04-19T18:48:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/4373","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4373","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4373.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4373.patch"},"body":"Closes #3365\n\nThis implementation does not apply smoothing _nor drag margins_ to the preview, which might be misleading in some cases (e.g. you still have to make sure the player can see what is displayed).

my game I developed some utility shaders because enemies flash white when they take damage or some sprites need inverted colors and I couldn't achieve those effects with modulate, this escalates so bad with multiple sprites because they need a shader with the UNIQUE flag for each one, this gets even worse if some enemies needs another shader behaviour.\n\nFor that reason I propose a change on modulate section from Sprite and Animated Sprite.\nThe idea is to support more lightweight utility effects of common use and let's the user cycle between them, only one effect is active at time for each sprite and could be cycled by animations or scripts included his properties.\n\nProposed changes to godot GUI to support this:\n![Image NewGui](http://i.imgur.com/UJyWSWU.png)\n- Move the Modulate to a new section called Effects\n- Here you could select the current effect from a dropbox, default one is modulate with white\n- Display controls related for each effect when one is selected\n\nAnd here is video from a prototype of how this section could behave:\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/xc06512cg9rdswm/2016-04-18_16-13-22.mp4?dl=0\n\nExamples of posible new effects:\nAdditive Blending: make enemies flash white or another light recolor\nSilhouette: change sprite to a solid color, could be used to make enemies flash white too\nDesaturate: convert sprites to shades of grey\nInverse: invert colors of a sprite\n\nSo what do you think about this

system or device:**\n\nArch Linux\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\n\nI was fiddling with AnimationPlayer and realized that it didn't autoplay an animation that was called `New Anim` (the default name). Soon I tried to `play()` it directly from code, but that started spawning errors like:\n\n```\nplay: Animation not found: New Anim\n```\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n- Create an AnimationPlayer node and create a new animation. Use the default name.\n- Create a script on the AnimationPlayer and insert the following code:\n\n```\nextends AnimationPlayer\n\nfunc _ready():\n    get_node(\"AnimationPlayer\").play(\"New Anim\")\n```\n- Save scene as `.tscn` and play\n- Observe that (1) the animation doesn't play, and (2) there is an error in the debugger\n- Save scene as `.xscn` and play\n- Observe that (1) the animation now plays, and (2) no errors are present.\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4366/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4365","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4365/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4365/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4365/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4365","id":149219882,"number":4365,"title":"Add an add_triangle_fan method to SurfaceTool","user":{"login":"bojidar-bg","id":5276727,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5276727?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg","html_url":"https://github.com/bojidar-bg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bojidar-bg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-04-18T17:37:29Z","updated_at":"2016-04-19T20:40:22Z","closed_at":"2016-04-19T20:40:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/4365","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4365","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4365.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4365.patch"},"body":"Closes #4298\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4365/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4364","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4364/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4364/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4364/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4364","id":149092888,"number":4364,"title":"Fixed SEGFAULT in zero-reserved arrays in nrex.

Using a boolean Uniform in place of the scalar uniforms would however make everything much clearer.\n\nAs a node the boolean uniform should take a name variable similar to other uniforms, and output either a 0 or a 1 depending on it's state. 0 for false, 1 for true. Or alternatively the values for false and true could be over-writable, i.e. be usable for any switches.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4361","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4361/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4361/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4361/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4361","id":149001724,"number":4361,"title":"HTTPClient

reason I opened this issue is because I just found one setting that can be a potential troublemaker when it comes to being able to debug and monitor a project.\n![godot_donottouch](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10081256/14589644/e96a5374-04ac-11e6-8f44-b51d6101cd25.png)\n\nThe setting highlighted in the image is exposed to the user for whatever reason, but if you set it to a different value, you can potentially cause the debugger and info windows to stop working after saving the project and closing/reopening (changing it back likewise makes everything work again). Good thing too since working on my project was slow without error reporting and prints.\n\nMy suggestion is that the developers work to remove the exposure of various technical functions that are likely to cause bugs and development trouble if they are changed at all. For instance, I would at least keep the _message queue-size_ parameter in the **core** category because an increase in that value is needed if you are to have large scenes, but there's others that appear to be so technical that only a C++ coder might actually know what they are and what they do (and if a user who only knows GDscript messes with them, who knows what issues will crop up).\n\nThoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4357/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4743","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"A01C:01FA:B56D2A:198196D:59D69DA9","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=251>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=249>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"d0058f61f4de4fc7cd1545776faf5ca8\"","status":"200 OK"}}
