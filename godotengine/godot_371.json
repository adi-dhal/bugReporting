I can separate each one to it's own report if there is need for it.\n\nBug 1:\nI can't select instanced scenes in 3D view-port by clicking their meshes. (_Edit:_ now in #2852)\n\nBug 2:\nWhen zoomed out it's impossible to select  some smaller objects. I'm not talking about 5px objects of course, they are reasonably big on screen to be selectable by user.\n\nProblem 1:\nCurrent way of indicating which objects are selected is not very useful, the bounding box corners are not very noticeable (actually not visible in light scenes) and it's often hard to see if I selected mesh or lamp even.\nWould suggest some sort of coloured outline around mesh objects and maybe sprite display change for lamps and stuff.\nAdditional benefit from outline is when working with stacked, intersecting meshes. User can then see borders of the object he manipulates and it's easier for him to see what he is doing.\n\nProblem 2:\nAwesome feature of Select Mode (Q) is that it can do bounding box selection, helps with selecting multiple or small objects, but it doesn't work if there are other objects behind object we want to select.\nIt then selects that \"behind object\" and because current nature of this tool automatically transforms it to the movement of the mouse, so there is no way to use bounding box selection in most scenes.\n\nI would suggest to separate selection from multi transform tool and make it more like ON/OFF mode for transform gizmos. It would also help if user wants, for example, only translate objects that he selects, or only select object without seeing any transform widgets on the screen that can stand in the way sometimes.\nI can elaborate that idea (visual help what I have in mind?) if that's not enough.\n\nProblem 3:\nIn 2D there is an option to Lock objects from selection, something like that would be useful for 3D as
