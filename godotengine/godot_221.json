So we always have to add the line manually and add the \"com.company.appname\" manually to build.gradle.template to avoid the crash and error messages.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n0. You need to have an Android Developer's account to access and set up the app in your Developer's Console in order to test and reproduce this.\n1. git clone https://github.com/ranmaru90/Play-Game-Services-Android-Module-for-Godot.git\n2. follow the instructions on that module's page and add the module to Godot's source then compile for Android, release template.\n3. use the release template to export a game, as release.\n4. install the exported release apk in your Android device, then run it.\n5. it crashes. check your logcat.\n6. then go to Godot's build.gradle.template.\n7. then add the applicationId \"com.company.appname\" line, replace the package name with your own.\n8. repeat the steps 2 - 5.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5251/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5250","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5250/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5250/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5250/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5250","id":160835307,"number":5250,"title":"Add

The code does not work, seems like multiple vector extractions and swizzling is not supported properly. Also `mat3(INV_CAMERA_MATRIX)` does not work (invalid constructor argument).\n\n`INV_CAMERA_MATRIX.w.xyz` does not work, while `(INV_CAMERA_MATRIX.w).xyz` is parsed properly.\n\nOriginal code:\n\n```\nvec3 world_normal = NORMAL * mat3(INV_CAMERA_MATRIX);\nvec3 world_pos = (VERTEX - INV_CAMERA_MATRIX.w.xyz) * mat3(INV_CAMERA_MATRIX);\n```\n\nWorking code:\n\n```\nvec3 world_normal = NORMAL * mat3((INV_CAMERA_MATRIX.x).xyz, (INV_CAMERA_MATRIX.y).xyz, (INV_CAMERA_MATRIX.z).xyz);\nvec3 world_pos = (VERTEX.xyz - (INV_CAMERA_MATRIX.w).xyz) * mat3((INV_CAMERA_MATRIX.x).xyz, (INV_CAMERA_MATRIX.y).xyz, (INV_CAMERA_MATRIX.z).xyz);\n```\n\nAlso... after adding a `EMISSION = world_pos;` the result is still in screen-space... So I guess there's a parser and a documentation error here.\n\n_EDIT:_\nI did this in the fragment shader for a material, which is marked as \"out\" in the documentation... weird.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5232/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5231","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5231/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5231/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5231/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5231","id":160467905,"number":5231,"title":"Premultiplied alpha to be supported on font import (old: smoothed text on the button)","user":{"login":"ret80","id":233268,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/233268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ret80","html_url":"https://github.com/ret80","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ret80/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ret80/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ret80/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ret80/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ret80/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ret80/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ret80/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ret80/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ret80/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-06-15T16:37:16Z","updated_at":"2016-06-21T18:17:15Z","closed_at":"2016-06-21T13:42:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\nGodot_v2.0.3_stable_win32\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\n\nText on the Button smoothed.
