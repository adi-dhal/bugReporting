tools/editor/editor_data.cpp:500.\n```\n\nSee issue #2611 which ended up being unrelated but has details on some findings on the error.  I've copied the findings here:\n\nhttps://github.com/okamstudio/godot/blob/master/tools/editor/property_editor.cpp#L2355\n\nIn `property_editor.cpp`, it's calling `get_edited_scene()`which is defined straight in the `editor_node.h` file inline.  This then calls `get_edited_scene_root()` resulting in the error message.  I think that call to `get_edited_scene()` on that line in `property_editor.cpp` needs an additional check?  Or maybe `PropertyEditor::update_tree()` needs to be called later on in some initialization setup?\n\nThis commit fixes the error message about `get_edited_scene_root`, but I haven't really tested it.\n\nhttps://github.com/firefly2442/godot/commit/2b4d089564496354cde4cc751e3fa846e5a4c8ff\n\nI didn't create a pull request yet because I wanted to get some input from you folks about it.  Should the check for a valid scene node be done here or someplace else?  It's just returning NULL which may not be a good solution.
