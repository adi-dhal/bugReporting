Everything works fine until you call .new on the sublcass.  \n\nIn the below example I will get the error:  Invalid call to function '_init'.  Expected 1 arguments on line 27 (func _init(val) in the SubInitParam class).  If I comment out the last two lines everything works fine.  Stack trace indicates the error started at 43 (where .new is called)\n\nYou appear to be able to add parameters to _init in subclasses (SubBaseWithParameter instances work fine), but if the base has one, everything goes kaput.\n\n``` python\nextends Node2D\n\nclass BaseClass:\n    var hello='w'\n    func _init():\n        hello='world'\n\nclass SubClass:\n    extends BaseClass\n\n    func _init():\n        hello='goodbye'\n\nclass SubBaseWithParameter:\n    extends BaseClass\n    func _init(val):\n        hello='with param:  ' + val\n\nclass BaseInitParam:\n    var hello = 'asdf'\n\n    func _init(val):\n        hello = val\n\nclass SubInitParam:\n    extends BaseInitParam\n    func _init(val):\n        hello = 'sub:  ' + val\n\nfunc _ready():\n    var base = BaseClass.new()\n    print(base.hello)\n\n    var sub = SubClass.new()\n    print(sub.hello)\n\n    var sub_with = SubBaseWithParameter.new('this works')\n    print(sub_with.hello)\n\n    var base_param = BaseInitParam.new('another one')\n    print(base_param.hello)\n\n    var sub_param = SubInitParam.new('yet another one')\n    print(sub_param.hello)\n```\n\nThis prevents you from being able to inherit from any class that has a parameter in the _init method.  \nYou also can't just make the sub class's _init method have no parameters.  You get the same error.\n\nAs a side note, I don't think this is restricted to just _init and inheritance.  I've seen this in other places as well but I've been able to work around them in the past.  I've currently painted myself into a corner and being able to do this would save a lot of refactoring.  \n\nP.S.\nThis might be related or a separate issue, but calling .new() with the wrong number of parameters crashes the app (not the editor) with no message, just 'godot.exe has stopped working'\n\n``` python\n#call without parameter when it has one\nvar sub_param = SubInitParam.new()\n#call with parameter when it doesn't have one\nvar sub = SubClass.new(1)\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2192","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2192/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2192/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2192/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2192","id":91377064,"number":2192,"title":"Rename collision layers","user":{"login":"robertdhernandez","id":1021995,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1021995?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdhernandez","html_url":"https://github.com/robertdhernandez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdhernandez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdhernandez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdhernandez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdhernandez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdhernandez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdhernandez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdhernandez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdhernandez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdhernandez/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":9,"created_at":"2015-06-26T22:24:07Z","updated_at":"2017-01-11T12:36:11Z","closed_at":"2017-01-11T12:35:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"A 10x2 checkbox isn't very helpful to indicate what layer is what.

(without requiring hours of work to re-connect everything).\n- Gives more room for experimentation\n- More accessibility to people who aren't seasoned game developers\n\nI hope you will find this a

Some animatiions use some 'blend pattern' with others, so these should be probably reusable.\n- Interoperation between several AnimationTreePlayers -\n  several AnimationTreePlayers could be running in parallel on the same set of object with\n  standard AnimationTreePlayer blend modes and filters.\n- Ability to drive single output pin to multiple input pins in nodes without requirement of copying\n  nodes, even if internally they will be copied, as this really de-clutters visual node display\n  getting rid of copies.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2170/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2169","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2169/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2169/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2169/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2169","id":90486057,"number":2169,"title":"Missing description in the documentation for Array.append() function","user":{"login":"set-killer","id":4090555,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4090555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/set-killer","html_url":"https://github.com/set-killer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/set-killer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/set-killer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/set-killer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/set-killer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/set-killer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/set-killer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/set-killer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/set-killer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/set-killer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":283518839,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"ffbbff","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/1/labels","id":1381437,"number":1,"title":"2.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":444,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-10-28T13:37:45Z","updated_at":"2017-07-28T10:44:22Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2017-07-28T10:44:22Z"},"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-06-23T20:42:06Z","updated_at":"2015-11-11T12:03:41Z","closed_at":"2015-11-11T12:03:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"On this wiki page:\nhttps://github.com/okamstudio/godot/wiki/class_array\n\nthere is link for the **append** function, but no description available.\nAlso there is no description in Godot Help screen -
