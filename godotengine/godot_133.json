to discuss here:\r\n- Adding a `update()` or `process()` method to `AnimationPlayer`.\r\n- Adding some way of post-processing the animation after each tick without getting cumulative results and other potential problems. API design, philosophy, etc.\r\n\r\nThis is what @SaracenOne and me said during the conversation that motivated this feature proposal:\r\n\r\n> One thing I noticed from seeing this is that it would seem we should add a 'manual' process mode to control exactly when the AnimationPlayer advances for the sake of adding procedural animation. I'll look into adding that in later.\r\n> \r\n> Do you mean a mode in which the animation would have to be told to be updated by code instead of doing it in the process callbacks?\r\n> \r\n> Yeah, basically where you manually call the 'advance' method to move the animations forward. By doing that, you can then add in extra bits of procedural animation through code on top of conventional animation for things like head rotation, IK, ect.\r\n> \r\n> Some random thoughts to consider:\r\n> - Currently in order to post-process animations I'm adding a node after the\r\n> animator so it gets processed after the former has updated. This could be\r\n> considered a standard way of doing it or instead just a hack so it's\r\n> advisable to add some explicit functionality to the player. Maybe a\r\n> post-process callback could serve.\r\n> - Furthermore, for 2D animations you need just rotation most of the time.\r\n> So a downside of the hacky approach is that when you need to tweak\r\n> positions in realtime (for instance, to keep your character's feet on the\r\n> ground while blending between crouch and stand), your animations must\r\n> include tracks for position to ensure adjustments don't accumulate, even if\r\n> they have just one key for the initial value.\r\n> It would be much better if the player featured a flag or something you\r\n> could enable for getting post-processing reset on every tick.\r\n> - Exposing an update() method may be useful; i.e., a shortcut for\r\n> player.seek(player.get_current_animation_pos(), true)\r\n> ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7894","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7894/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7894/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7894/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/7894","id":210340296,"number":7894,"title":"_process is still called after set_process(false) if done early","user":{"login":"Zylann","id":1311555,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1311555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann","html_url":"https://github.com/Zylann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279097162,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/discussion","name":"discussion","color":"ee77ee","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-02-26T19:15:35Z","updated_at":"2017-04-28T15:50:20Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Tested on Godot 2.1.2\r\nWindows 10 64 bits\r\n\r\nIf `set_pocess(false)` is called on a node before its  `_process()` is called, it will still be called for the current frame.

is there a addForce Function directly in rigidBody2d AND in Physics2DDirectBodyState**\r\n\r\n`add_force ( Vector2 offset, Vector2 force )`\r\nI'm wondering, because there is also a apply_impulse function and it makes much more sense to have apply_impulse since force has to be applied over a period of time to have an effect but since the physic is running in a different thread it is really hard to apply the force for the right periods of time especially if it's just a short interaction.\r\n\r\nIn addition there is also the `Physics2DDirectBodyState` which also allows for a add_force function. which makes a lot of sense. but both Is confusing. since force would be applied over a longer period of time anyways (I don't know how it would make sense otherwise especially considering the existence of apply_impulse) I think it would make the most sense to only give access to that function int the `_integraetd_forces` function.\r\n\r\nMaybe that is not even an Issue since it has a reason but I would like to know the reason for it. and if someone tells me I also would be willing to document it :)\r\n\r\n**To bring my question to a point**\r\nIt makes sense, that there is `apply_impulse` + `add_force` but why is there `add_force` in ** rigidBody2d** the `add_force` in **Physics2DDirectBodyState** makes sense though.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7870/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7869","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7869/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7869/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7869/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7869","id":209321128,"number":7869,"title":"Fix

way.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7868/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7867","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7867/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7867/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7867/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/7867","id":209320906,"number":7867,"title":"Crash

system or device - Godot version:**\r\nGodot 2.1 and 3.0\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\n`MessageQueue::flush()` is not designed to be reentrant. But it can contain a message that indirectly makes it called again while the first call has not exited. The new call will reprocess every message already processed by the first call. This produces wrong behaviors and crashes.\r\n\r\nThis only happens on `SceneTree::input_event()` because it calls `MessageQueue::flush()` (at https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/de0045cf1b0a5e20fbf74da192039d344ee8d0c7/scene/main/scene_main_loop.cpp#L493 and https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/de0045cf1b0a5e20fbf74da192039d344ee8d0c7/scene/main/scene_main_loop.cpp#L514) so if an input event is sent while `flush()` is already running, that is, during a deferred call, a notification, etc., the bug appears.\r\n\r\nI've tried to fix it by making `MessageQueue::flush()` reentrant (https://github.com/RandomShaper/godot/commit/53f0a2c18287da19d1342206dbeb3cdd22a4212a) but that doesn't sort out every possible situation.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n\r\nCreate a test scene with this script:\r\n\r\n    func _ready():\r\n        queue_free()\r\n\r\n    func _notification(what):\r\n        if what == NOTIFICATION_EXIT_TREE:\r\n            var ie = InputEvent()\r\n            ie.type = 1\r\n            get_tree().input_event(ie)\r\n\r\nThis example is particularly sadistic because `free()` will be called twice. (I hope this is correct since I've typed it from the top of my head.)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7867/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4860","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"CD83:572D:133629D:2EB2A87:59D69BC3","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=134>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=132>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"167a77c189ee9a1374f7fe9117c7db97\"","status":"200 OK"}}
