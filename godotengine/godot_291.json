However when the game is run, it's the previous version of the code that is running. I can re-edit and re-save the script several times but its still the old version that gets loaded in-game.\n\nI can confirm that because when I close the editor and reopen the project, the script is the previous version as it was never saved.\n\nI don't know if this extends also to common script (.gd) files but I guess it does.\nI can't provide a sample project or steps to reproduce because it

to recreate:\n1. Open many tabs until the arrows appear.\n2. Click on the right arrow until you get to the last tab.\n3. Close all visible tabs.\n4. When you are done, no tabs will be displayed and you will have to click the left arrow to get back to the first tab/tabs that were hidden after step 2.\n\nThe tab container should automatically try to fill the free space with open tabs after closing one.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3127","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3127/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3127/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3127/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/3127","id":123686299,"number":3127,"title":"Subscenes no longer updates variables values in parent scenes","user":{"login":"kubecz3k","id":6129594,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6129594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k","html_url":"https://github.com/kubecz3k","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/1/labels","id":1381437,"number":1,"title":"2.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":444,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-10-28T13:37:45Z","updated_at":"2017-07-28T10:44:22Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2017-07-28T10:44:22Z"},"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-12-23T16:24:43Z","updated_at":"2016-01-24T10:22:43Z","closed_at":"2016-01-24T00:43:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Subscenes no longer updates their values in parent scenes.
