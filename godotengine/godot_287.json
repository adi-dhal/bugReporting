When you have lots of frames(100+) and you need to insert one into a lower id it can cause you to have to reset many of your animations. A way to mitigate this would be to allow us to group sprite frames by another id number. So if I put all of my movement frames into group 1, and all of my Idle frames into group 2, adding new frames to group 1 will not effect group 2, you would only need to adjust animations associated with group 1.\n\nFor animations that already have no group they could just be auto assigned to a group 0 or 1.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3269","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3269/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3269/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3269/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3269","id":125483040,"number":3269,"title":"TextEdit/LineEdit:
