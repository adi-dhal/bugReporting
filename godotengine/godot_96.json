Use `NOTIFICATION_ENTER`/`EXIT_WORLD` for `Area` (intead of `*_TREE`).\r\n- Now both bodies' and areas' constraints are cleaned up.\r\n- And now also that happens as soon as the space is set to null (i.e., when exiting the tree) instead of only at freeing time.\r\n- When clearing constraints, the loop goes on to the next if the current is already released, instead of breaking.\r\n- When one has been already released, no error is shown from now on, as it's something expected, since a pair (our kind of constraint of interest) can be freed by any of its involved collision objects and the other will try again.\r\n- Implement index shifting (or marking as -1) for shapes indices in collision pairs shapes are removed.\r\n- Standarize behavior of bodies and areas so that anything that invalidates a given pair gives the same result (collision mask, actual collision, etc); for instance, triggering area enter/exit signals.\r\n- Add missing member initializations.\r\n- Extend the new-space-equals-area/body-current-space test to every case.\r\n- Fix 3D ray-casts early accepting Areas (skipping the mask check).\r\n- Fix unpairing of large elements (2D's `BroadPhase2DHashGrid`).\r\n\r\nSome of these prevent random crashes caused by constraints with dangling pointers to involved objects.\r\nFixes #8856.\r\nFixes #7589.\r\nFixes #6676.\r\nAnd maybe others.\r\n\r\n~~__NOTE:__\r\nOne of the issues is fixed by #9094, so I've worked on this with that one merged so it's a dependency.~~\r\n\r\n~~__UPDATE:__\r\nI've started noticing an issue that can
