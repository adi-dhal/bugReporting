understand that CollisionShape/CollisionPolygon nodes are being reworked for 3.0, so I wanted to add this request to the mix:\r\nAs far as I know, there is no direct way to attach a CollisionShape/CollisionPolygon etc. to a bone, since collision shapes have to be a direct child of a body to work (and of course they are editor-only helper nodes). For complex rigs, animating collision shapes can be a lot of work. So if there was a possibility to somehow tie the movement of a collision shape to a bone, it would become a lot easier to set up skeletal animations with collision shapes. \r\nThat could be achieved like suggested in issue #2174, or by a node that works similar to the \"joint\" nodes (where you assign \"Node A\" and \"Node B\"). \r\nI guess something like this can already be done with scripting to a certain degree, by accessing the collision shapes of a body and messing with their transform. But an easy, direct solution for the editor would be great.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8318/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8317","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8317/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8317/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8317/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8317","id":220394070,"number":8317,"title":"Fix side effects of the bookkepping of Area/Area2D's monitoring (2.1)","user":{"login":"RandomShaper","id":11797174,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11797174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper","html_url":"https://github.com/RandomShaper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-04-08T11:32:00Z","updated_at":"2017-04-08T21:03:22Z","closed_at":"2017-04-08T20:47:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/8317","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8317","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8317.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8317.patch"},"body":"- Fix monitoring flag being reset when the scene is out of the tree (happens on save all if the current scene is not the focused one, therefore on save-on-run as well)\r\n- Fix the inability to reset the monitoring flag while the area is out of the tree\r\n\r\n@lonesurvivor, @volzhs, @reduz, @akien-mga,\r\n\r\nCould you have a look at this and test if this doesn't break your use cases?\r\nFinally, I think some or all of this should be ported to 3.0 but the code there is not in the same initial state.
