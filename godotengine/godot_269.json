I believe this is a great addition and speedup for GDscript.\n\nThe PR does three things, in three commits:\n1. Integrate commit by @sheepandshepherd to add a `RangeIterator` class. Many thanks to @sheepandshepherd for writing the class!\n2. Add a built in `xrange` function similar to the one in Python 2, and document the function\n3. Replace `range` with `xrange` for for loops. This is guaranteed to be 100% backwards compatible, unless you relied on `for i in range(...)` to allocate memory xD... I'm not really proud of how I hacked the parser to do it but this is most conservative regarding backwards compatibility. Note that the `GDParser::_reduce_expression` method does stuff like this as well, so I guess its fine. It catches 99% of all uses. Or do you know somebody who assigns range to a variable and then loops over the variable?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3814/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3813","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3813/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3813/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3813/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/3813","id":135911662,"number":3813,"title":"Steam thinks Godot is still running after I quit","user":{"login":"adolson","id":6351421,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6351421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson","html_url":"https://github.com/adolson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false},{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-02-24T00:30:47Z","updated_at":"2016-03-19T09:45:38Z","closed_at":"2016-03-19T09:45:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Operating system or device:**\n\nLinux 64-bit, Steam version\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\n\nSteam thinks I am still running Godot after I quit.

And when it does not appear clear. And people have to live with supposedly stable version is not known how many. Updated between stable versions of bad practice. And how to live?\n\n[ru]\nОчень удивился появлению стабильной версии 2.0! Совсем недавно создал пару багов которые до сих пор не закрыты. И если посмотреть на существующий список найденных ошибок то он очень огромен. И при всем этом уже есть стабильная версия!\nПроблема в том что версия 2.0 уже не поддерживается. Найденные в ней ошибки исправлять не кто не будет. Они будут исправляться в уже следующей версии 2.1. А когда она появится не ясно. И людям придется жить с якобы стабильной версией неизвестно сколько. Обновляться между стабильными версиями плохая практика.

important to get rid of version control-wise, as it changes basically all the time, it just depends whether you pressed Ctrl+S while looking at the script of the 2D screen.\n> \n> IMO it might be useful to keep the distinction 2D vs 3D using a meta argument (i.e. whether the scene should open by default the 2D plugin screen or the 3D one?), but maybe we could simply ignore the Script screen?\n> Then when saving the scene on the 2D screen, it would define `\"__editor_plugin_screen__\":\"2D\"`, on the 3D screen it would define `\"__editor_plugin_screen__\":\"3D\"` (just like it does now), but on the Script screen it would keep the previous definition (2D or 3D). WDYT?\n\n@eska014:\n\n> Agree, this `__meta__ = { \"__editor_plugin_screen__\":\"2D\" }` is annoying\n\nMaybe just use the scene root node type to determine initial view?\nI don't really care for this
