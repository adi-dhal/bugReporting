This in Godot 2.0 Alpha (b59c86f6f953ce6957bccbcc1ec6f3ce4c55572d) is causing crash of debug console, so in the end when game crashes there is no indicator why. \nI'm unable to reproduce this in every project (on simple ones it works fine for me), but I modified platformer 3d demo in the way it's behaving like this. (In the demo there is an Autoload that causes crash because of calling funcion on null, after couple seconds from running it).\n\nSteps:\n1. Download sample project\n2. Load editor with the project\n3. Run it instantly.\n4. Project will crash in a couple seconds and there will be no indication on why (hopefully)\n\nAnyway here is sample project:\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/168251/godot/some/issues/platformerDebugConsoleCrash.7z\n\nHere is one minute video from my experimentation, first part with debug console crash, second part with fix: https://youtu.be/F4t756bWS9I\n\nFurther observations:\nIn other project, when I was trying to pause game with breakpoint and debug (which is possible for some time before console crash) I was able to see an error that there is no such node like \"/root/global\" (at the time when given node should be fetchable)\nAlso it seems that this bug is **not easy to reproduce** and might be related to performance somehow. It's harder for me to reproduce with release_debug compilation flags... (but still possible). \nBecause of that I think this bug should not be labeled as 2.0 milestone, until more people will have it. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2651/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2650","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2650/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2650/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2650/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2650","id":112629533,"number":2650,"title":"Using Navigation2D Node with a tilemap print \"LINK\" and \"UNLINK\"","user":{"login":"TotCac","id":12817474,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/12817474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TotCac","html_url":"https://github.com/TotCac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TotCac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TotCac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TotCac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TotCac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TotCac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TotCac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TotCac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TotCac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TotCac/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-10-21T16:34:00Z","updated_at":"2015-12-22T20:11:57Z","closed_at":"2015-12-22T20:11:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It seems if you use a navigation2D with a tilemap as children, and this tilemap use tile with navigationmeshinstance in it, engine print \"LINK\" and \"UNLINK\" for each tile.\n\nError can't be reproduced with this example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-zEA_Ce1mk\n\nChecking in repository, i can't get why happening in 2D because in:\nscene/2d/navigation2d.cpp (print_line have comments)\nscene/3d/navigation.cpp (print_line haven't)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2650/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2649","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2649/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2649/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2649/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2649","id":112564471,"number":2649,"title":"&lt;
