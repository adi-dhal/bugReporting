The object with this material will still contribute to gi, but the emissive material will not display on the object.\r\n\r\n**Further ideas:**\r\n\r\nAfter discussing this with reduz, it could be a good idea to have a flag (under Emission) that could be toggled to replicate this behaviour intentionally.\r\n\r\nIf this was taken to the next logical level, it would be very useful to be able to specify how bright the visible emission was, as compared to its gi energy contribution. When turning up the emission energy to get enough light it often results in the visible part of the object clipping to full white and losing any other surface properties (emission color, reflections) of the object.\r\n\r\nIf it were possible to have the visible emission as a separate slider to the gi contribution ,it would enable a wider variety of glowing and emission effects. While this may not be physically correct, it is more art directable and can look more attractive. If you look at a glowing light bulb in real life, you can still see the form(and writing etc) on the bulb, but in cg this is usually just an clipped/ overbright white.\r\n\r\nIn this example image, I have baked the scene with the emission energy of the balls material all on 8. After baking I have dialed the energy value down to 8/6/4/2 respectively, which can potentially give a more desired look(particularly the 2nd image) without the visible emission clipping to white. The only problem with doing this, is that upon subsequent rebakes you would have to manually tweak each emissive material back to this value. Not sure if this even possible with PBR but it would be very useful? Could also work the other way around...ie a low gi energy value for baking and then overcranking the visible value for an intentional overbright/clipped look.\r\n\r\n![energy_visible_idea](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7741669/27068927-c964cb2c-5055-11e7-9387-ae9cddc70c3b.jpeg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\n<!-- Optional but very welcome.

system or device - Godot version:**\r\nLinux 64bit Ubuntu 16.04 - Godot 3.0 alpha commit a8a1f2e2a864e6b58d5bcf1c7e53a43cdb6d95d9\r\n\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nAdding uniform sampler2D on shader_type canvas_item, brakes and forceclose godot\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\ncreate a scene with:\r\n.- a Light2D\r\n.- a Sprite with a texture and a Material (ShaderMaterial)\r\n\r\n*The Light2D has a texture with alpha (point light from the godot demos)\r\n\r\n*The Light2D mode is Add with white color and energy=1\r\n\r\n*The texture for the Sprite is a diffuse texture and the ShaderMaterial code is:\r\n\r\nshader_type canvas_item;\r\nrender_mode blend_add;\r\nuniform sampler2D normal_tex;\r\nvoid fragment(){\r\nNORMAL = texture(normal_tex,UV).rgb * vec3(2.0,2.0,1.0) - vec3(1.0,1.0,0.0);\r\n}\r\n\r\n*The Shader Param \"Normal Tex\" is used to set the normal_map image of the diffuse texture\r\n\r\n\r\n***The normal_map code is working, you can check this by:\r\n*1- Chage the sprite texture to its normal_map texture\r\n*2- Comment the line\r\n//uniform sampler2D normal_tex;\r\n\r\n*3- Change the code to:\r\nNORMAL = texture(TEXTURE,UV).rgb * vec3(2.0,2.0,1.0) - vec3(1.0,1.0,0.0);\r\n\r\n*Then the light and normal_map works but since we are using the normal_map as diffuse, it defeats the purpose, but you can check this way that NORMAL and TEXTURE are working

Mouse input Event\r\n\r\n\r\n@pixelpicosean recently and Myself a couple of month ago both put effort in making trackpad support better.\r\nThis issue should sum up the ideas to discuss them. There are a couple of discussions in pr's which talk about the same topic but I though a dedicated place would be nice.\r\n\r\n## current implementation:\r\nmost mouse events are just \"hacked\" into the mouse button event. With custom mouse buttons like:\r\nscrollUp /  ScrollDown / scrollLeft / scrollRight and recently Magnify. Precision input is than achieved by a float called `factor` which is set to the value how far the mouse was scrolled/magnified.\r\n\r\nAll this made sense When trackpads were simpler and mouses only used scroll wheels which had increments and fired events on each increment. So the wheel actually behaved like a button.\r\n\r\n## Current Issues:\r\nthe issue with this implementation is that it is hard to figure out what event to use for scrolling and magnifying, Because mouse button does not seem to be the most obvious thing (if you don't know about it)\r\nIn addition to that it does not fit at all into the new introduced class based event system. Each event type should be another class. not the same class with different types.\r\n\r\n# Proposal for redesign:\r\n\r\n## 1. move different mouse events to classes\r\nEvents all of them Inherit From `InpuEventMouse` so you have access to position...\r\n```cpp\r\nInputEvnetMouseScroll\r\n    Vector2 direction\r\nInputEvnetMouseGesturePinch\r\n    float zoom\r\nInputEvnetMouseGestureRotate\r\n    float angle\r\nInputEvnetMouseGestureSwipe\r\n    Vector2i direction\r\n    float speed\r\nInputEventMouseButton\r\n    int button\r\n    bool pressed\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis system is much more straight forward to use:\r\n\r\n## comparison:\r\n\r\n### example for moving node with a trackpad scroll\r\nold:\r\n```cpp\r\nif event is InputEventMouseButton:\r\n    if event.buttonIndex == MOUSE_BUTTON_SCROLL_LEFT:\r\n        node.position.x -= event.factor\r\n    else If event.buttonIndex == MOUSE_BUTTON_SCROLL_RIGHT:\r\n        node.position.x += event.factor\r\n    if event.buttonIndex == MOUSE_BUTTON_SCROLL_UP:\r\n        node.position.y -= event.factor\r\n    else If event.buttonIndex == MOUSE_BUTTON_SCROLL_DOWN:\r\n        node.position.y += event.factor\r\n```\r\n\r\nnew:\r\n```cpp\r\nif event is InputMouseScroll:\r\n    node.position += event.direction\r\n```\r\n\r\n### example for sizing node with a Pinch gesture\r\nold:\r\n```cpp\r\nif event is InputEventMouseButton:\r\n    if event.button_index == MOUSE_BUTTON_GESTURE_PINCH:\r\n        node.size += event.factor\r\n```\r\nnew:\r\n```cpp\r\nif event is InputEventMouseGesturePinch:\r\n    node.size += event.zoom\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 2. Add device enum\r\n\r\nin InputEventMouse:\r\n\r\n```\r\nenum Device{\r\n    DEVICE_TRACKPAD\r\n    DEVICE_MOUSE\r\n    ... and maybe drawing table or touchscreen (although that is handled by compleatly different events)     or special apple mouse with touch ;)\r\n}\r\nInputEventMouse\r\n    Device device\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows to determine the input device and execute different actions for different devices.\r\n\r\n### example\r\nscroll up in 3d could be panning or orbiting when it is emitted by a touchpad and zoom when it is emitted by a mouse\r\n\r\nscroll down in 2d: panning when using DEVICE_TRACKPAD and zoom DEVICE_MOUSE\r\n ```cpp\r\nif event is InputEventMouseScroll:\r\n    if event.device == DEVICE_MOUSE:\r\n         viewport.zoom += event.direction.y\r\n    else if event.device == DEVICE_TRACKPAD:\r\n        vieport.scrollOffset += event.direction\r\n```\r\n\r\n## To Discuss\r\n\r\n - of course as always everything (it's godot community, ppl like feedback ;) ).\r\n - naming: InputEvnetMouseGesturePinch or InputEvnetMousePinch\r\n     - is the Gesture keyword necessary?\r\n - Is a swipe gesture actually beneficial or should it just be implemented with scroll left/right and some threshold logic (I love using swiping to switch scripts so in general that would be a nice feature. although I think it might be better to implement it as an signal listener for controls. Since every swipe also needs setup when it triggers...)\r\n - naming of `direction, zoom, angle`. What would you type in when trying to get the scroll value of a class named `InputEventMouseScroll` ?\r\n\r\n*the code I posed is more or less pseudocode. I don't event know if I used correct class and constant names...

having a hard time figuring out this problem, so I'll leave this issue open until I (or someone else) can solve it. This is valid for 2.1 and 2.2, so I assume it is the same for master.\r\n\r\nThe UWP app exported does not run when installed, it just crashes on opening. The only debug info I have is the EventViewer, which does not help at all:\r\n\r\n`ActivateApplicationForContractByAppIdAsUserWithHost of the app Godot.Engine.Test_q1xfrwf3pzxew!App for the Windows.Launch contract failed with Access is denied..`\r\n\r\nTrying to debug the installed app from Visual Studio (via Debug > Other Debug Targets > Debug Installed App Package) is not helpful because it runs fine there! So there's something fishy about how apps are launched that is a mystery (at least for me).\r\n\r\nSumming up what I know:\r\n\r\n1. The app runs fine if compiled with `target=debug` or `target=release_debug` build, but crashes on opening with `target=release`.\r\n2. The `target=release` build runs fine from Visual Studio, even when debugging the installed app.\r\n3. Compiling the release with `/SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE` instead of `/SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS` makes it work, but also opens the console window when launched.\r\n4. This is not the case when running on the phone emulator. The release build opens fine there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9130","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9130/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9130/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9130/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9130","id":235248480,"number":9130,"title":"Fixed
