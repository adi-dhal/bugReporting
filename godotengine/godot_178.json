: The generic purpose of this patch is to **detects when the GLES2 module turns Godot into a zombie process because the graphics drivers crashed in the middle of a blocking process**.\n\nUnder Windows, AMD drivers around version 16.7.3 have a bug that make\nthem crash and reset on OpenGL initialisation when DualGraphics\nCrossFire is enabled. (**edit :** this bug exists since at least DOOM3 and RAGE release, and is thus not likely to be fixed anytime soon by AMD.)\n\nGodot.exe will then become a zombie process.\n\nThis hack/workaround adds a timeout mechanism that will warn and inform\nthe user that the timeout might be caused by a buggy graphics driver,\nand that will kill the Godot zombie process.\n\nThe timeout is set to occurs after 10 seconds.\n\nWhen AMD will have fixed their drivers, this workaround will be\ntransparent and might be removed. (**edit :** this bug exists since at least DOOM3 and RAGE release, and is thus not likely to be fixed anytime soon by AMD.)\n\nFixes #6502\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6518/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6517","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6517/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6517/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6517/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6517","id":177489058,"number":6517,"title":"Listener2D","user":{"login":"robertdhernandez","id":1021995,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1021995?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdhernandez","html_url":"https://github.com/robertdhernandez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdhernandez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdhernandez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdhernandez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdhernandez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdhernandez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdhernandez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdhernandez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdhernandez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdhernandez/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/7","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/7","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/7/labels","id":2529217,"number":7,"title":"3.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":114,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2017-05-18T13:33:56Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T12:23:57Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-09-16T18:22:21Z","updated_at":"2017-08-05T13:29:22Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There's a Listener for Spatial but there's no Listener2D for 2D positional audio, which is tied to the viewport position.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6517/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4815","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"BE1E:572D:133BED9:2EC0733:59D69C7B","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=179>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=177>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"0b772c011522466ff02c45e16f414e32\"","status":"200 OK"}}
