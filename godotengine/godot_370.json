this is kind of an edge case, but GridMaps using a MeshLibrary file only update once after overwriting that MeshLibrary file with a new one. After this, you have to restart Godot for the changes to happen. To describe my process in more detail:\n\n1) Import a scene of tiles and convert it to a MeshLibrary.\n2) Create a GridMap and use the MeshLibrary as the theme.\n3) Reimport the scene of tiles and convert it to a MeshLibrary, not merging it with the previous MeshLibrary file, but overwriting it.\n4) Check the GridMap, and it should update with the new tiles.\n5) Repeat 3 and 4, but the GridMap no longer updates with new tiles.\n\nThis being a weird situation, if necessary I can provide a video showing the problem in action.

And,\n2. The elements of any windows do not accommodate to the window size upon startup, look:\n   ![godot-mal](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1055216/4554973/25b8ed3e-4eb7-11e4-9dc6-f0d7797a90dc.png)\n   I have to float the window and then stack it again in order to get the elements of Godot's UI accommodate to the size of the window when stacked:\n   Floating: \n   ![godot-float](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1055216/4555006/7dd46908-4eb7-11e4-8737-c49163679592.png)\n   re-stacked: \n   ![godot-bien](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1055216/4555011/8ac2c38a-4eb7-11e4-9343-cfc97776640d.png)\n   After this, Godot is able to fit the GUI properly.\n\nHope this bug report makes sense. Having this fix before Godot hits version 1.0 is a good idea, so I better report this now.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/766/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/765","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/765/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/765/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/765/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/765","id":45210048,"number":765,"title":"Fix

So, if I'm correct in my understanding, this would allow one to:\n\n> Import a scene from a DAE file, \n> Alter the imported scene in Godot (i.e. instance other children scenes into it, alter properties in the scene, etc),\n> Alter the source file and re-export into the same DAE file,\n> And then update the Godot scene to reflect the changes.\n\nSo this would allow one to effectively build both the structural \"shape\" of objects or scenes in Blender, for example, while also building the scene up hierarchically and functionally in Godot without having to start fresh after each scene import.\n\nThis logic appears to be wholly missing in Godot, as I couldn't get Godot to update the scene rather than just import it fresh (or do nothing). My attempts and results are:\n\n> On selecting the ! in the top-right corner and checking my scene I'm trying to update, the scene reloads, but has been unchanged.\n> \n> On choosing to \"Re-import\" from the Import menu, the scene is rolled back to the correct data from the DAE file, but none of the changes I've made in Godot.\n> \n> On choosing to import \"3D Scene\" from the Import menu, it similarly is rolled back to the correct data from the DAE file, but none of the changes I've made in Godot.\n\nIf necessary, I can provide a video of the process failing or an example project zip. Thanks.\n\nAssociated forum thread about it here:\nhttp://www.godotengine.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=981\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/758/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/757","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/757/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/757/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/757/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/757","id":45075131,"number":757,"title":"Build failed","user":{"login":"fredlim","id":8569368,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8569368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredlim","html_url":"https://github.com/fredlim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredlim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredlim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredlim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredlim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredlim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredlim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredlim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredlim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredlim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"punto-","id":6645309,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6645309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/punto-","html_url":"https://github.com/punto-","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/punto-/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/punto-/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/punto-/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/punto-/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/punto-/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/punto-/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/punto-/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/punto-/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/punto-/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"punto-","id":6645309,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6645309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/punto-","html_url":"https://github.com/punto-","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/punto-/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/punto-/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/punto-/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/punto-/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/punto-/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/punto-/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/punto-/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/punto-/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/punto-/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2014-10-07T07:00:52Z","updated_at":"2015-10-09T21:37:40Z","closed_at":"2014-10-12T05:23:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I follow the new build instruction but failed.\n\nLINK : fatal error LNK1181: cannot open input file 'winmm.windows.tools.lib'\nscons: **\\* [bin\\godot.windows.tools.exe.exe] Error 1181\nscons: building terminated because of errors.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/757/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4624","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"DD20:572C:15314A0:2A1471A:59D6A00F","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=371>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=369>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"9f348eb5576999d8c63ded6b6a3c5f35\"","status":"200 OK"}}
