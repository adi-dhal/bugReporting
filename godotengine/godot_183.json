were discussing different ways to make code tagging in Godot in #6371 and, since this idea is a little bit different, I'll make a separate discussion for it. \n\n**Why we need code tagging:** \nAs projects grow, you get more and more code you need to manage. It's very likely that you forget about some incomplete, outdated or buggy block of code in some file. Code tagging can help with that, by showing code that needs attention.\n\n**How this should work:** \n- By default there should be a list of commonly used tags like [Incomplete], [Needs fixing], [To do] etc.\n- Users should be able to create their own tags\n- Tag properties: name, background color\n- In context menu of highlighted code, there should be [Apply Tag] dropdown menu. After user selects tag from it, background color behind selected lines of code should change to tag color\n  ![screenshot at 2016-09-04 14 33 47](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10696955/18230905/451507dc-72b2-11e6-84c7-ffabcd0f0251.png)\n- [Metrics] button on the panel with [Tutorials] and [Classes] could show the window with list of files with tagged code as well as percentage of tagged code in file/project \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6390/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6389","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6389/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6389/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6389/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6389","id":174924012,"number":6389,"title":"Misspelled resource works","user":{"login":"EdwardAngeles","id":6760623,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6760623?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdwardAngeles","html_url":"https://github.com/EdwardAngeles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdwardAngeles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdwardAngeles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdwardAngeles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdwardAngeles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdwardAngeles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdwardAngeles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdwardAngeles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdwardAngeles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdwardAngeles/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279537176,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/hacktoberfest","name":"hacktoberfest","color":"00eeee","default":false},{"id":279097562,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:android","name":"platform:android","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/6","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/6/labels","id":1807486,"number":6,"title":"2.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":263,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-06-03T16:13:32Z","updated_at":"2017-09-18T11:53:44Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2017-09-18T11:53:44Z"},"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-09-04T00:10:24Z","updated_at":"2016-10-03T10:00:22Z","closed_at":"2016-10-03T10:00:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device -

This reduce the number of unwanted change.\nThat could be done automatically with a fixed constant directly in the engine (something like 5 or 3) or with an option in the global project setting.

might be a duplicate of #344, but that issue is over 2 years old so I thought it'd be better to make a new one instead to bring fresh discussion.\n\n---\n\nIt's inconsistent for Sprite to handle spritesheets and AnimatedSprite to handle multiple image sprites. Sprite should be just a simple Node that renders a 2D image with a definable sub region. It shouldn't also do sprite animations -- that's what AnimatedSprite is for: a sprite that has multiple frames defined by a SpriteFrame (or multiple images) and animates it very simply. If users want more customized sprite animations, they can use an AnimationPlayer; otherwise the AnimatedSprite handles majority of animated sprite cases in an easy format.\n\nThe other issue with Sprite doing animations, is that animating them requires an AnimationPlayer, which becomes really tedious to adjust the Sprite:frame for each key for each animation (unless I'm unaware of a better method).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6367/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4810","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"BEB1:572A:6C0372:F2DE18:59D69C90","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=184>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=182>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"404b84a9a56e94e7ec72b944846ec28d\"","status":"200 OK"}}
