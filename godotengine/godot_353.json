They are all 32bits.\n\nCross compilation from linux using Mingw64 does not compile to 64bits, because scons uses `i686-w64-mingw32-g++` instead of `x86-64-w64-mingw32-g++`.\n## also, for windows users who compile using Visual Studio C++ 2010 express\n\nVisual Studio C++ 2010 express does not support 64 bits compilation by default. It will always compile to 32bits without warning whatever `scons bits=64`.\nFor 64bits support, you need to install extra packages (yahoo it, or duckduckgo it to find it), and when you'll run the the vcvarsall.bat, you'll have to add extra argument : `vcvarsall.bat amd64`.\n## how to test if a .EXE is 32bit or 64bit application ?\n### under linux or mingw msys terminal :\n\nUsing the ``file myapp.exe` command line.\nIf it replies `PE32 executable ... 80x86`, then it is 32bits.\nIf it replies `PE32+ exectabke ...x86-64`, then it is 64bits.\n### under windows 7 or 8 64bits:\n\nRun the .EXE, then Ctrl+Alt+Delete, then click \"Task Manager\", look for your .EXE into the Running Applications. If there is a `(32bits)`, then it is 32 bits ... if nothing, then it is 64 bits ..\n\nOther test : right click on you .EXE, click \"Properties\", then \"Compatibility Tab\", check the \"Compatibility mode\" checkbox. If the combo-list contains Windows 95 or 98, it is a 32bits application.

Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_noise)** (also known as improved Perlin Noise) has many uses in modern game development, as it lies at the heart of procedural generation. Infinite terrain, voxel worlds, clouds, and just about any texture with realistic, natural patterns can be generated using Simplex Noise. It's commonplace in modern game engines.\n## Simple examples of simplex noise use:\n- **3D simplex noise for 2D animation** _(passing through the third dimension over time)_: http://blog.bdero.me/some-simplex-noise.html\n- **2D simplex noise for 3D terrain generation:** http://blog.bdero.me/infinite-simplex-noise-map-3d.html\n## Example implementations:\n\nFortunately, it's also pretty easy to implement.\n- **JavaScript implementation:** https://github.com/jwagner/simplex-noise.js/blob/ecfa36aed21d56b298143633b30be554754f3410/simplex-noise.js#L139-L262\n- **Python implementation:** https://code.google.com/p/battlestar-tux/source/browse/procedural/simplexnoise.py#243\n- **C++ implementation:** https://code.google.com/p/battlestar-tux/source/browse/procedural/simplexnoise.cpp#243\n\nThe ideal implementation would involve allowing the user to set the RNG's seed somehow (whether it's set using a separate function in advance or passed as a parameter to the noise functions), and exposing the noise functions in \"@GDScript\", which might look something like this:\n\n``` python\nfloat simplex2d(x, y)\nfloat simplex3d(x, y, z)\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1268/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1267","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1267/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1267/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1267/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/1267","id":54738821,"number":1267,"title":"Project Manager spits errors after deleting projects","user":{"login":"adolson","id":6351421,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6351421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson","html_url":"https://github.com/adolson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-01-19T08:49:02Z","updated_at":"2015-11-18T22:18:52Z","closed_at":"2015-11-18T22:18:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If a project has moved or been deleted from disk, launching the Project Manager will spit this out:\n\nERROR: _load_recent_projects:  Condition ' err!=OK ' is true.

This is another case where a more friendly format (OpenDDL-based) would be called for. See also #1167.\n\nIdeally, old projects that no longer exist on disk should be removed automatically from the editor_settings.xml file, along with the recently-opened scenes stuff.
