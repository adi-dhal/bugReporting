description:**\r\nWhile moving collision shapes around I have noticed, that the gizmo does not update its transform accordingly. I have observed the issue with every type of shape resource, and it also manifests if you change the transform of any one of parent nodes.\r\n\r\nIn order to fix the issue, I have to select some other node, and then select the collision shape node again.\r\nI have not noticed any issues with other gizmos.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n1. Create Collision Shape node and assign it a new shape\r\n1. Try to move/rotate/scale said node, or its parent node\r\n1. Observe the issue\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\n![test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26769454/28886574-46a1fd72-77ba-11e7-8f9c-c005a3498fec.gif)\r\n\r\nPlease note, that the perceived movement of the gizmo is caused by moving cursor over shape handles, which causes the gizmo to update its transform.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10049/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10048","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10048/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10048/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10048/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/10048","id":247472025,"number":10048,"title":"It's impossible to run the project from the editor.","user":{"login":"kubecz3k","id":6129594,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6129594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k","html_url":"https://github.com/kubecz3k","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kubecz3k/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-08-02T17:56:12Z","updated_at":"2017-08-08T07:29:23Z","closed_at":"2017-08-08T07:29:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\r\nLinux, 0586524b9ce67bdcab5cef88397c44bb7b9e46fb\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nAfter clicking 'play' button nothing changes in the editor.

Sure, you can use `_input(event)` as workaround, but it leaves some problems like \"input fighting\" between overlapping controls.\r\n\r\n2. `mouse_filter` property of controls doesn't work for touch events. As a result, events \"fall through\" all controls and go into `_unhandled_input(event)`. And this may be bad if you're trying to handle touch events inside the world (like, for pinch-zoom).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this was made this way intentionally, but to me it makes more sense if both mouse events and touch events are handled the same way.\r\n\r\nSo, I propose to add processing of `InputEventScreenTouch` and `InputEventScreenDrag` inside `_gui_input_event` similarly to mouse events.\r\n\r\nWell, actually, I already implemented this feature in my local fork of repository, but I'm unsure if I should create PR or leave it like that, since it changes behavior of input system.\r\n\r\nPS. I use master branch of engine, so it's all about upcoming Godot 3.0","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10039/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10038","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10038/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10038/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10038/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/10038","id":247314907,"number":10038,"title":"Deleting an asset/resource should remove imports & related files as well","user":{"login":"razvanc-r","id":1177508,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1177508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/razvanc-r","html_url":"https://github.com/razvanc-r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razvanc-r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razvanc-r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razvanc-r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razvanc-r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razvanc-r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razvanc-r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razvanc-r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razvanc-r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razvanc-r/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-08-02T08:43:31Z","updated_at":"2017-08-15T20:21:54Z","closed_at":"2017-08-15T20:21:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\r\nGodot alpha1 v3.0\r\n\r\nSo when you delete something like an `obj`, `png`, `dae`, whatever which have been imported it's reasonable to remove all other related files from `.import` and the `*.import`, `*.flags` etc. files.
