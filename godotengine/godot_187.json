`TileSet`. Now, I know you can have a `StaticBody2D` with a `CollishionShape2D` that has `Trigger` set to `On`, but I think it would make much more sense to be able to have a tile with an `Area2D`, which I guess it isn't possible now? Or am I missing something? You may want to have tiles which trigger certain events but don't block player / enemy movement for example so in this cases it would make sense to have `Area2D`. I'm sure this isn't a big deal but it would be a nice feature to have since this is exactly what `Area2D` is supposed to do (among other things)... unless I'm missing something obvious
