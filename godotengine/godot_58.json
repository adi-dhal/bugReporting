The engine is not able to decide in which order to render them without additional information, which we cannot provide to it at the moment, so it renders them in arbitrary order.\r\n\r\nA related problem is that for some reason [Godot assumes](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/d9a97aae04b947517c286f019ce7cd8abd3745fe/drivers/gles3/rasterizer_scene_gles3.cpp#L2185) that all Unshaded materials have alpha, which is actually rarely the case. This prevents from properly sorting materials that actually have or don't have alpha.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10135/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10134","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10134/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10134/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10134/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10134","id":248302912,"number":10134,"title":"Fixed crash on exist, change to only use audio driver manager to finaize drivers","user":{"login":"JiahuiCai","id":16479286,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16479286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiahuiCai","html_url":"https://github.com/JiahuiCai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiahuiCai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiahuiCai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiahuiCai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiahuiCai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiahuiCai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiahuiCai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiahuiCai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiahuiCai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiahuiCai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-08-07T04:09:09Z","updated_at":"2017-08-07T09:11:12Z","closed_at":"2017-08-07T05:16:38Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/10134","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10134","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10134.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10134.patch"},"body":"Previous PR: #10126, I had to do a hard reset to fix the encoding issue with that commit.\r\n\r\nRelated to #10045 #10028 #10034\r\n\r\nI figured that the crash was caused by deleting the audio driver Singleton twice in the cleanup.\r\n\r\nOnce in AudioServer::finish(), Once in OS_Windows::finalize().\r\n\r\nSince the names suggest that Audio Driver Manager is used for driver management, I feel like it is better to do all the driver finalization with it instead of inside AudioServer class.\r\n\r\nThis is my first time submitting a pull request in my life, Please let me know if I am doing anything wrong or inappropriate.

PR adds a simple crash reporter that dumps the stacktrace to stderr, implemented for various OSes:\r\n\r\n- On Linux it adds a signal for SIGSEGV/SIGFPE that prints the stacktrace when the signal is triggered. It uses addr2line to get file/line number.\r\n\r\n- On OS X it also adds a signal for SIGSEGV/SIGFPE that prints the stacktrace when the signal is triggered. It uses atos to get file/line number.\r\n\r\n- On Windows it uses __try/__except to catch exceptions. Only supported on MSVC (no mingw support yet).\r\n\r\nNote, the code is only enabled with crash_report=yes on debug mode, also after the stacktrace is generated the crash is passed to the OS so that you can debug if necessary.\r\n\r\nThis is a screenshot of how it shows the stacktrace on Linux:\r\n![screenshot from 2017-08-06
