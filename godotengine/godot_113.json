Set your particle material. Go into the scale curve editor. Select either point at the beginning or the end. It will make new points instead most of the time. Try to create a point in the middle of the curve. Now try to select it. Most of the time all you can do is create a new point beside it or on top of it.\r\n\r\nPossible issue is that the selection area is way too small.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8493/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8492","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8492/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8492/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8492/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/8492","id":223577694,"number":8492,"title":"GDNative: ability to handle \"editor\" and \"export\" versions of a library","user":{"login":"Zylann","id":1311555,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1311555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann","html_url":"https://github.com/Zylann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":580537003,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:gdnative","name":"topic:gdnative","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-04-22T16:57:34Z","updated_at":"2017-05-18T12:00:43Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Currently GDNative allows only one version of a library for each platform, however it would be good for it to also support a version that will be used in editor with debug checks and messages (eventually editor tools), and have an optimized version of the library being used when it gets exported.\r\n\r\nThe first idea I have in mind is basically doubling the amount of paths to setup (per platform per mode), having one of them optional if the library doesn't need to.

master, Windows 10 64 bits\r\n\r\nPassing a reference to a GDNative class to the method of another GDNative class doesn't work.\r\n\r\nI created two C++ classes in a GDNative library, with the following setup, simplified:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nclass A : public Reference {\r\n\r\n\tvoid _init() {\r\n\t\tm_seed = 131183;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tint get_seed() {\r\n\t\treturn m_seed;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tint
