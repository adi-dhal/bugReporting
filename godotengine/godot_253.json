You can't directly control the particle emission rate. Besides being confusing, this causes at least two issues:\n\n**1. Changing the particle Lifetime changes the emission rate** (double the lifetime --> half the emission rate), which means you have to adjust two properties at once to get the effect you want. \n\n**2. Animating the Amount to a lower value will delete particles instantly rather than letting them expire normally.** This is the real issue. Because of this there's no way to animate an emitter's spawn rate without it looking horrible and choppy as random particles vanish instantly. Enabling/disabling works fine, but obviously that's pretty limited.  \n\n[Edit] **3. Since Amount and Lifetime are linked, we can never have a random particle lifetime feature.** Being able to spawn particles with variable lifetimes would be a nice addition to particle systems, but since that would mess up your spawn rate, it's not really an option with the current setup. \n\n_A side issue: the Amount can't be set to zero for some reason._\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4294/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4293","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4293/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4293/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4293/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4293","id":147630372,"number":4293,"title":"Mesh class needs to be un-crippled","user":{"login":"slapin","id":6099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin","html_url":"https://github.com/slapin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slapin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-04-12T04:39:55Z","updated_at":"2016-04-12T07:35:07Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For a long time the Godot supports accessing  mesh internals only using GLES calls,\nand it is basically disabled in many configurations.

However the optimization only seems to apply to Sprites (and maybe StaticBody2D nodes, I'm not sure). So my issue is that some of my tiles have attached NavigationPolygonInstance nodes, which don't seem be culled. So right now, generating paths for worlds of 300x300 and larger causes significant performance drops, even for short distance path finding. So now I need to make my own system to add/remove those tiles as the player moves around.\n\nHowever I see this feature not being desirable for some games that want long distance navigation paths, so maybe a \"Enable Navigation Culling\" checkbox could be implemented for those of us that do want it.\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\nI can upload my game to demonstrate the issue if

addons path is hardcoded to point to `res://addons/*` [as evidenced by code](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/a895e2e372c9df2a9972f38134ae0ea9c8bf45a8/tools/editor/editor_plugin_settings.cpp#L22).\n\nBefore addons were introduced, the only hardcoded paths were `res://engine.cfg`, `res://export.cfg` and `res://override.cfg`, all of which are `.cfg` files (I might be missing some of them though, that is based on a quick code search). In other words, even though we configure all paths in `engine.cfg` and `export.cfg`, addons are all folders in a hardcoded folder, without `.cfg` files for listing them, and/or allowing them to go in other directories (E.g. \"What if I want them to go in `res://vendor/plugins/`?\").\n\n**Proposed solutions:**\n1. Allow the `res://addons/` path to be changed in `engine.cfg`.\n   - **Pros:** Would allow for a bit more freedom when choosing a project structure. (E.g., I can move all addons under the `sahder/addons` folder instead.)\n   - **Cons:** The auto-installer/addon lib just got a bit more complex...\n2. Add a `[addons]` section to `engine.cfg`, where addons are listed as paths to their respective `plugin.cfg` or folder.\n   - **Pros:** Would allow some addons to be enabled and others disabled, without moving the folders around.\n   - **Cons:** Harder to manually add an addon, maybe an installer GUI would be necessary.\n3. Add a `addons.cfg` file, which contains that section instead of `engine.cfg`\n   - **Pros:** Better division of concern, `engine.cfg` is less bloated.\n   - **Cons:** One more hardcoded path, `engine.cfg` isn't that big yet.\n\nNote that if 2 or 3 is chosen, it might be nice to include the link/git repo from which the addon was downloaded, so we would be able to distribute the project without the addons inside. (Or.... git submodules to the rescue `;)`)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4279/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4278","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4278/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4278/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4278/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/4278","id":147310795,"number":4278,"title":"Both \"Scene/Save Scene As..\" and \"File/Save All\" use Shift-Ctrl-S","user":{"login":"vjrossi","id":17793037,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/17793037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjrossi","html_url":"https://github.com/vjrossi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjrossi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjrossi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjrossi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjrossi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjrossi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjrossi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjrossi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjrossi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjrossi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":283518733,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"007700","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-04-11T04:06:04Z","updated_at":"2016-06-21T10:02:29Z","closed_at":"2016-06-20T19:18:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Found on Windows 10, Godot v2.0.2.\n\nWhen pressing Shift-Ctrl-S while editing a script, I expected all unsaved scripts to be saved.

Based on #4174, various plugins can work together like one, but a big problem with this now is the plugins don’t know exactly what the others are doing.\nFor example creating a addon for filtering(Random tiles or auto-mapping, #843) tiles in a `TileMap` node is not possible, or not practical, you can handle the input but you don't know what tool the editor is using.\n\n---\n\nI created a small example for the `TileMapEditorPlugin`:  \n- TileMapEditorPlugin\n  - RandomTileAddon\n  - PolygonDrawAddon\n  - MinimapAddon\n\nIn this case we have three different plugins with different functionalities. They need differents API functions, and different levels of access.\n\n| Name | Description | Required API |\n| :-: | --- | --- |\n| RandomTileAddon | Simple addon to draw random tiles automatically | The `TileMap` editor have the `_set_cell` function used by all tools of the editor, for this addon it is interesting to override the function when the user press a key or toggle a button |\n| PolygonDrawAddon | Addon for drawing a \"polygon\" of tiles | This addon will use two existing features line drawing and bucket fill. If the user \"activate\" the addon all the viewport input will be handled by this addon, and the addon will release the \"focus\" when the polygon is finished. A virtual function for drawing on the editor viewport, for example `viewport_draw`, can be useful for this addon |\n| MinimapEditorAddon | Simple addon to display a minimap of the `TileMap`, for faster navigation | This is a especial type of addon it don't need override any function, handle any viewport input or draw anything on the viewport. It will only need access to the viewport(#3992) to add a custom widget, which will handle all the input and drawing |\n\n---\n\nOther ideas:\n- A addon for a editing a custom type can have a \"special access\", it can override some functions of the C++ plugin, or simply \"override\" the entire plugin.\n- A similar API of the `SpatialEditorGizmo` for 2D can make addons for this type of node faster and simpler.\n- Every plugin should have a simple API for extending it's toolbar menu, panels or docks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4275","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4275/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4275/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4275/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4275","id":147226151,"number":4275,"title":"Update

Enables automatic detection of architecture for the MSVC compilers.\nBuilds without assembly optimisations for x64\nCloses issue #3098\n\nInfo: Currently godot cannot be compiled out of the box for 64 bit on MSVC compiler, because until this fix we were not properly seting up the MSVC compiler to compile for different architectures... \n\nIn fact, setting arhitecture in MSVC is somewhat impossible for scons (a wee bit hard manually, and shoudn't be done, because it would clash with attempts of the developer to set it up for the arhitecture he wants to build for...)\n\nSo, in light of that, this fix disables the bits parameter in scons for MSVC, but it also enables detection of the compiler and configures scons bits automatically instead (ie based on which dev prompt the user has invoked, or which vcvarsall.bat setting it has invoked...).\n\nI hope the instructions that scons gives on errors are sufficient to allow you to manage to test properly. I tested on MSVS 2015 Community Eddition (cl.exe version 18) prompts and vcvarsall.bat, but this should support a wide range of MSVC versions. Needs testing, of course.\n\nThis pull changes how MSVC build parameters work so Travis test should fail if it is setup to test MSVC builds (seems it's not setup).\n\nBest regards.\n\nP.S. sys.exit() used because i saw it used in SConstruct\nP.P.S.
