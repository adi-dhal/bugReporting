system or device - Godot version:** Windows 10 - 2.1.1 stable\r\n\r\n\r\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\r\n- I made a simple scene with a Node2D as \"root\" and a \"TextureButton\" as a child.\r\n- I added two textures for the \"Pressed\" and \"Normal\" (just black and white textures for the test) button's states\r\n- I also added a script attached to the \"root\" object having the following code:\r\n```\r\nextends Node2D\r\n\r\nfunc _on_TextureButton_mouse_enter():\r\n\tprint(\"_on_TextureButton_mouse_enter\")\r\n\r\nfunc _on_TextureButton_mouse_exit():\r\n\tprint(\"_on_TextureButton_mouse_exit\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n1) Move the mouse cursor in the button's bounding rect (TextureButton class - I didn't test with other classes)\r\n2) Press the LMB (**L**eft **M**ouse **B**utton)\r\n3) Move the mouse cursor outside the button's bounding rect\r\n4) Experience the issue: the \"_mouse_exit\"

Now the exact area is computed for those shapes as the AABB can have a pretty different volume if the shape is in an arbitrary orientation.\r\n\r\n- The inertia tensor was not computed correctly because the orientation of the object w.r.t. the rigid body origin was not taken into account\r\n\r\n- The vector of inertia only makes sense in the \"Principal Axes of Inertia\" frame of reference that isn't always equal to the rigid body frame of reference and which has to be computed through diagonalization of the tensor of inertia ( The Jacobi method has been implemented to diagonalize a symmetric matrix, it is the same used by Bullet ).\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia#Principal_axes\r\n\r\n- The vector of inertia/inertia tensor only makes sense if computed w.r.t the rotation center i.e. the center of mass for a free rigid body, which has to be computed. The center of mass returned by the new *get_center_of_mass()* method is in global orientation with position relative to the rigid body position.\r\n\r\nNOTE: the slider joint dosn't work but it seems not to be related to these changes as it wasn't working even without\r\n\r\nHere is a test project with some test scenes that can be run before and after my changes to see the difference https://www.dropbox.com/sh/y44l0surabi56rb/AADpJjVHtJsv4IKwCaZnUISga?dl=0","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7426/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7425","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7425/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7425/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7425/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7425","id":198534613,"number":7425,"title":"Fix for the huge audio latency (>200 ms) for the …","user":{"login":"lonesurvivor","id":14860837,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/14860837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonesurvivor","html_url":"https://github.com/lonesurvivor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonesurvivor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonesurvivor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonesurvivor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonesurvivor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonesurvivor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonesurvivor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonesurvivor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonesurvivor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonesurvivor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":410064485,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/needs%20testing","name":"needs testing","color":"ff9900","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-01-03T18:13:35Z","updated_at":"2017-01-10T14:19:14Z","closed_at":"2017-01-10T14:19:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/7425","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7425","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7425.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7425.patch"},"body":"…PulseAudio, ALSA and RtAudio driver.\r\n\r\nPartly fixes issue #6965.

This is required for good brush editing, which combined with easy texture assignment ( #7418 ), easy scaling on all axes ( #7419 ) and more primitives ( #1381 ) could be an absolute game changer for being able to slap brushes of different sizes into the level quickly, then assign automatic \"World UV mapping\" with a basic scale factor to avoid manual UV adjustments. This is also how most oldschool BSP editors work (Quake 3, ...) which is by the way an absolutely amazing and super quick way of throwing together basic level geometry.
