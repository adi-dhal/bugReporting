Confusing and time consuming**.\n\nFor example -\n- first you place grass tiles,\n- then you want to place lets say, road tiles, and **here blind and time consuming work begins, because you can not see how the tile you want to put on this place will look**, if it fits in this location ? if it looks good here ? maybe it should be rotated or not ? You cant tell it, because you see grass tile (the one that is allready placed) **and will not see your road tile until you really place it**. You gota imagine how it will look, risk and put it there to find out if it fits or not, and eventualy replace it back with grass or something else.\n\nHow should it be -\n- first you place grass tiles, (or anything you like)\n- then when you want to place road, you hover your road tile above grid and you see how it will look in this place because the **tile under it should be temporarly hidden** (so you can see road tile (which you hover) not grass tile (which actualy is in this position))\n\n**IMPROVEMENT PROPOSAL**\n**its very simple change but brings huge improvement and workflow speed up**\n**\\- when you hover one tile above place where allready is another tile**\n**\\- this another tile should be temporarly hidden - so you can see how your new tile will look here, and decide if you want to put it here or not, rotate or maybe chose another tile**.\n\nor another idea, much simplier but little dirty,\nmake the cursor with hovering-tile become a tiny little bit above tile which is under it so you can see the hovering tile.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**\nHere is small movie on how it looks rite now.\nYou have grass tiles, and want to replace some with another tile (a road tile), **but you cant see how it will look because you see the grass tiles until you replace it with your hovered tile**.\nYou have to guess if it will look good, or try and place it then eventualy replace back - all around.\nThe other tile (grass) should be temporarly hidden when hovering another tile (road) above it.\n![gridmapgif](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3224132/16542566/f36a17a0-40ad-11e6-999a-c8c35c13d94c.gif)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5525","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5525/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5525/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5525/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5525","id":163532059,"number":5525,"title":"windows get_latin_keyboard_variant() implementation and gdscript binding, #5503","user":{"login":"SuperUserNameMan","id":9801802,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/9801802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan","html_url":"https://github.com/SuperUserNameMan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SuperUserNameMan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":205417413,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:windows","name":"platform:windows","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279098255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:porting","name":"topic:porting","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-07-02T19:14:47Z","updated_at":"2016-07-10T15:45:05Z","closed_at":"2016-07-10T15:41:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/5525","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5525","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5525.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5525.patch"},"body":"This is the `OS_Windows::get_latin_keyboard_variant()` implementation of `OS::get_latin_keyboard_variant()`, and its GDscript binding.\n\nThis method was already implemented for OSX.\n\nIt is still missing for LINUX, ANDROID and others platforms for which it will return QWERTY by default.\n\nThere is an open discussion about the purpose of this function, and the alternative workarounds here #5503.

system or device - Godot version:**\nMac OS X 10.11.5 - Godot 2.1- f6725f9\nBuilt with flags `scons platform=osx theora=yes`\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nSuddenly — doesn't even matter if I go a few days back in commit history — I have the \"Stack Frames\" tab always empty.\n\nEssentially, if I put in a breakpoint, the line is not highlighted and clicking \"Step Over\" isn't following the script.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n1. Create a breakpoint\n2. Test scene\n3. Play the edited scene (F6)\n4. Wait for breakpoint\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\nIt's with one specific project that I'd like not to share. New projects seem to work fine; in fact, after testing with a new project, I reopen this one, it works at the _very first_ breakpoint, but then I click on \"Step Over\" and the \"Stack Frames\" window empties itself again. Remains empty in subsequent tests.\n\nI honestly don't know whether to consider this a bug or just something I screwed up in the settings.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5510/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5509","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5509/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5509/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5509/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5509","id":163274195,"number":5509,"title":"core/hq2x.cpp generates a ton of warnings","user":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-06-30T21:46:07Z","updated_at":"2016-07-05T20:04:45Z","closed_at":"2016-07-05T20:04:45Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"When compiling Godot from scratch, I noticed that half the build log is due to warnings generated in `core/hq2x.cpp`.

system or device - Godot version:**\nWindows 7 - 2.1 alpha build\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nOverwriting group memberships of instantiated scenes can't be modified (at least not from within the editor).\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nAssign a group to a root node of a scene, then save the scene and instantiate it in another scene. The instance belongs to that group (as shown in the editor as well as tested in a script). However, if you remove the membership from the instance in the editor, it is still in that group (when tested by script). If you close and reopen the scene, the membership is shown in the editor again.\n\nI'm not sure if that is intended behavior, since the group editor doesn't have reset buttons like the properties have. If it is, the group editor should be hidden when an instance of another scene is selected since changes don't have an effect anyway.\n\nedit:\nIt seems that adding groups to instanciated scenes is possible, only removing the \"inherited\" ones isn't.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5505/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5504","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5504/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5504/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5504/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5504","id":163193116,"number":5504,"title":"Canvas

according to what returns `OS.get_locale()`, but is not safe.\n\nAn other workaround when it is about mapping \"WASD\", is to use \"ESDF\" instead, but it might not be 100% universal, and might disturb some hardcore-gamers.\n\nAn other workaround for \"WASD\" that make AZERTY (\"ZQSD\") and QWERTx (\"WASD\") and QZERTY (\"ZASD\") all work out  of the box, is to map [WZ] [AQ] [S] [D].\n\n~~PS : and if you also want to support DVORAK (\",AOE\") keyboard out of the box, you'll have to map [WZ,] [AQ] [SO] [DE].~~\nedit : there are several variant of DVORAK : dvorak for left hand, for right
