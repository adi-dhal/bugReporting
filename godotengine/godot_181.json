This compiles without an error. The old value is lost then.\n\nBut wait, there's more! With some basic testing:\n\n```\n    var a = Vector3(0, 0, 0)\n    var b = Vector3(2, 2, 2)\n    var a = Vector3(b.x, a.y, b.z)\n    print(a.y)\n```\n\nThis will bug out at runtime, complaining `a` is `Nil` when wanting to combine `b` and `a` together.\n\n```\n    var a = _grid.get_translation()\n    var b = Vector3(2, 2, 2)\n    var a = Vector3(b.x, a.y, b.z)\n    print(a.y)\n```\n\nThis does **not** cause an error at runtime. `a` \"correctly\" becomes 2, 0, 2 (when the grid was at Y=0).\n\nIn the context of my above code, it gets even worse: The new value of `grid_pos.y` somehow becomes the Y value of `camera_pos`!\n\n```\nfunc _process(delta):\n    # Snap-move the grid to place it centered under the camera.\n    var grid_pos = _grid.get_translation() # Grid is at 0,0,0\n    print(grid_pos.y) # Prints \"0\"\n    var camera_pos = _camera.get_translation() # Camera is at 0,3,6\n    var offset = grid_size * max_grid_steps / 2\n    var grid_pos = Vector3(camera_pos.x - offset, grid_pos.y, camera_pos.z - offset)\n    print(grid_pos.y) # This funnily prints 3 now, though grid_pos.y was 0 all along!\n        # It seems to have taken camera_pos.y's value instead.\n    _grid.set_translation(grid_pos)\n```\n\nTo cut a long story short: Redeclaration should be an error, right? The other things might just be follow-up errors.\nI fell over this several times already, getting values I totally do not expect.\n\nSorry if it has been discussed before and for some reason is allowed now. But the behavior with the Y value doesn't make any sense at all.\n\nThis also happens with local variables shadowing more global ones, though that would still be okay (even if it should raise a warning or something).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6453","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6453/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6453/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6453/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6453","id":176244807,"number":6453,"title":"Scrolling outside Popup areas makes it disappear","user":{"login":"floydnunez","id":1719570,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1719570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/floydnunez","html_url":"https://github.com/floydnunez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/floydnunez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/floydnunez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/floydnunez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/floydnunez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/floydnunez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/floydnunez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/floydnunez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/floydnunez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/floydnunez/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-09-11T13:51:27Z","updated_at":"2016-09-28T10:41:12Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Mac OSX El Capitan, Godot v2.1.stable.official\n\nI have a Button marked as a toggle, to show and hide a Popup.

The debugger says that the Popup loses its visibility. It is not moved around, and using the debugger to make it visible again fixes it until the scroll is done again. The code in the button is not being triggered (the 'unpressed! hiding!' message doesn't show up).\n\nI think it is not about the button specifically. Replacing the code with a toggle that depends on a variable and instead using the button's pressed method does nothing to fix it. Also it seems that scrolling over some other areas of the screen hides the popup as well. But my minimal example uses a button to show the popup. The Popup documentation doesn't mention anything about this behavior. It doesn't work the other way either: scrolling doesn't make the popup visible.\n\nChecking the \"Exclusive mode\" option on the Popup inspector seems to fix it as well (scroll won't make the Popup disappear), but at least on my example it prevents pressing the button again without using the enter key (the mouse won't function to press the mouse) which is odd too.\n\n[demo_bug.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/466017/demo_bug.zip)\n\nI include the example project.\n\nDo note that including a ScrollContainer on the Popup still lets the ScrollContainer to scroll correctly, when scrolling OVER it.

done the experiment of compiling the Android export templates with the _hard_ float ABI instead of _soft-fp_. I've written a simple test script and measured:\n\nCurrent _soft-fp_: 1781 +/- 48 ms\nExperimental _hard_: 1796 +/- 53 ms\n\nPretty surprising for me. I didn't expect a big gain because GDScript is a large bottle neck compared with the floating point calling convention; but a pessimization?\n\nMaybe my test program is not the best one for this task or maybe this has yielded gains in other aspects (render, sound, etc.) and only a real-word example is appropiate for testing.\n\nOr maybe this change just does not improve things at all and should not be merged. However, as long as Godot is built as a whole and the relevant functions are qualified with `JNICALL` it should be safe.\n\nAt least I've pushed it for the records in case some day this is considered again so both these notes and the relevant compiler flags, etc. could be grabbed from here.\n\nP. S.: The test program is an empty scene with this code:\n\n```\nextends Node2D\n\nfunc _ready():\n    set_process(true)\n\nfunc _process(delta):\n    var start = OS.get_ticks_msec()\n    for i in range(0, 1000000):\n        i = float(i)\n        cos(i) * sqrt(i) + exp(i) / i\n    var end = OS.get_ticks_msec()\n    print(end - start)\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6438/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6437","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6437/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6437/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6437/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6437","id":175943631,"number":6437,"title":"Make popup windows / grid column widths resizable","user":{"login":"RayKoopa","id":9631152,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/9631152?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa","html_url":"https://github.com/RayKoopa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RayKoopa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":283518733,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"007700","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-09-09T07:16:45Z","updated_at":"2017-03-14T10:32:37Z","closed_at":"2017-03-14T08:55:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\nWindows 10 x64 - Godot 2.1 stable\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nSo I'm sitting here using one of these huge 2560x1440 monitors at default DPI. Godot runs maximized. Opening the editor settings popup window for example makes it that wide that it starts to become hard to trace back the setting value on the far right to the setting's name on the left.\n\nI tried to resize the window, but it seems to be of fixed width. That's a little annoying. (It even just closes when simply trying to hit the border but missing it thus clicking the main application window, or just scrolling outside of it above the main window, but that's another topic).\n\nOn top of that, I cannot resize the columns of the grid showing me those settings (to shrink - or better, even autofit - the setting's name column). I saw it was possible in some older version of Godot, but the headers are gone.\n\nCan it be made possible to show these column headers again or (even better IMHO) make those popup windows resizable?\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nBuy a monitor which is far too huge, open settings window, enjoy (or not).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6437/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6436","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6436/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6436/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6436/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/6436","id":175897530,"number":6436,"title":"Tweaked
