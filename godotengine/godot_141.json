Issue is, that I really dont know how to detect the error, if it is even possible, and deal with it in code, as exceptions simply dont exist and the function returns 0 (which is the code for OK, if I'm not mistaken).\r\n\r\nSeeing this problem, and a lot of others, maybe exceptions could be added in gdscript? I know that this has been addressed before, and rejected as godot aims to be difficult to crash. That is why I'm proposing the following:\r\n\r\n1. Have exceptions be non-fatal. That means that an exception would just go to the debugger and print out an error message if not caught, instead of crashing the program\r\n2. Exceptions should not travel back the call stack. This should:\r\n    * Make it easy for godot to tell whether or not to print a debug message\r\n    * Prevent unwanted behaviour, as the exception would not have to terminate the function, and keep doing so, until it reaches a try block.\r\n    * Make it easier for developers to anticipate exceptions, as they would only have to worry about the immediate context of the try block, instead of whatever functions the functions inside the try block call\r\n3. To throw exceptions, the throw command would be used, which would accept an exception object, or for ease of use, the following parameters in order:\r\n    * A brief description (string) - required\r\n    * Any clarifications that may be useful (string) - optional\r\n    * An error code (int) - optional\r\n    The same parameters could be used to construct exception objects\r\n    ````GDScript\r\n    func error_prone_function():\r\n        throw \"Invalid IP\", \"<user-supplied IP here>\", ERR_INVALID_IP\r\n    ````\r\n4. To catch exceptions (pretty standard):\r\n    ```GDScript\r\n    try:\r\n        error_prone_function()\r\n    catch exception:\r\n        print(exception)\r\n    ```\r\n5. Optionally, as exceptions do not travel back the call stack, a command that would rethrow exceptions if they occur could be useful:\r\n    ````GDScript\r\n    # This would throw an exception with a description \"Error!\"\r\n    func error_prone_function2():\r\n        attempt:\r\n            error_prone_function()\r\n    ````\r\n    Instead of\r\n    ````GDScript\r\n    # This would throw an

a `shape` property for `TouchScreenButton` that lets you specify a non-rectangular hot area (namely, a `Shape2D`) for it.\r\n\r\nAlso adds a `shape_centered` boolean which keeps the shape centered on the button; useful for regular shapes like rectangles and circles. Since those are the most probable use cases, the centering is on by default. For a polygon you'll probably want to keep it left-top-aligned by unchecking this one.\r\n\r\nIf both a bitmask and a shape are provided, both will be checked for press in an 'or' fashion. The raw item rect will be checked only if neither of those are set, exactly what happens currently: if a bit mask is present, the raw rect is not checked. As a consequence, **this enhancement is backwards compatible**.\r\n\r\nYou can see the shape in the editor at all times and at runtime only if the _Visible Collision Shapes_ is on. Maybe I should provide a way of turning its visibility off, but I haven't been able to think of a good way. Suggestions welcome.\r\n\r\n# Example use case\r\n\r\nMy own use case is to let the player press the on-screen buttons by touching along all the height of the screen, rather than just the actual button bounds. I didn't want to use `bitmask` for the stated reasons and I also didn't want to add a huge transparent area to the button textures to expand their bounds.\r\n\r\nI've added this script as a built-in one to my touch buttons:\r\n```\r\nextends TouchScreenButton\r\n\r\nfunc _ready():\r\n\t# Detect touch along all the height of the screen\r\n\tvar rect = RectangleShape2D.new()\r\n\tvar width = get_item_rect().size.x\r\n\tvar screen_h = OS.get_window_size().y\r\n\trect.set_extents(Vector2(width * 0.5, screen_h))\r\n\tset_shape(rect)\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Design rationale\r\n\r\n* While there is already a `bitmask` property by which you can supply a non-rectangular shape, it allocates memory proportionally to the size of bounding rect of the hot area. Thus the `shape` way is more lightweight. And more user-friendly.\r\n\r\n* I considered letting the button have `CollisionShape2D` children so more complex shapes could be created by combining primitives. I dropped that idea because\r\n\r\n    - you can loosely (but accurately enough) match an irregular button shape with a polygon;\r\n    - the API and editor experience are more user-friendly;\r\n    - the implementation doesn't get complex.\r\n\r\n# 2.1 only?\r\n\r\nNo!\r\n\r\n@akien-mga, I will make the version for _master_ if this one is accepted.

system or device - Godot version:**\r\nXubuntu 14.04 64-bit, compiled myself Godot 2.1.2 & templates.\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nI noticed the problem with ScrollBars in my android app when edited and exported from 2.1.2.  For no reason at all ScrollBars - when clicked on - drop to the value of 0 and the grabber part does not react to any clicking, dragging, moving etc. to change the value. It remains at 0 value no matter what. :( \r\nApp exported from 2.1 had no such problems and ScrollBars worked properly.\r\nTrying to recreate the bug in newly created project (attached in this issue) I was not able to recreate exact behavior, but I found other, similar, but I guess related problem.\r\nCheck the attached project or take the steps below:\r\n*_**When opening the project, notice that the left ScrollBar is just a dot in the upper left corner. I saved the project with it having the same parameters/values/look as the right ScrollBar.**_\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nCreate ScrollContainer. Add a VScrollBar child to it. Set VScrollBar's position, size and/or rotation (or use the attached project).\r\nRun the project. No matter of previous settings VScrollBar will be just a dot of size(12,12) in position (0, 0) and probably other parameters changed (default settings?)\r\nAlso:\r\nYou may change the settings of the VScrollBar and save the project. Then quit to the Project List and load the project again. You will see reset values of size, position etc.\r\n\r\nI was not able to reproduce \"zeroing\" effect after clicking, but I guess this strange behavior is probably connected to the problems I found in my app.\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\n[scroller_test.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/728363/scroller_test.zip)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7632","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7632/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7632/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7632/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7632","id":202976225,"number":7632,"title":"2D

If set to `true`, any `WindowDialog` control can be resized with the mouse by hovering over the border and dragging it.\r\n- Rewrote the movement code (initiated with the titlebar) to no longer make the cursor move away from the dragging point when the cursor leaves the game window to the top.\r\n- Prevented windows to be moved so far to negative Y coordinates so that the title bar would disappear (and making it impossible to move the window back later on). I do not prevent them to be moved out of view into any other direction at the moment.\r\n- Fixed weird style boxes for the popup_dialog image, also aligned the close button more exactly to the right corner of the title bar.\r\n\r\nThe cursor is changed when hovering over the borders of resizable dialogs just like in any window manager I know.\r\nSadly, due to https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/7622 this does not reset the cursor when the mouse moves off the window, but is still hovering another control.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7628/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7627","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7627/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7627/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7627/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/7627","id":202876435,"number":7627,"title":"Undefined math constants breaks windows build","user":{"login":"hammeron-art","id":6967786,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6967786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammeron-art","html_url":"https://github.com/hammeron-art","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammeron-art/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammeron-art/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammeron-art/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammeron-art/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammeron-art/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammeron-art/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammeron-art/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammeron-art/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hammeron-art/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-01-24T16:53:22Z","updated_at":"2017-01-24T17:03:03Z","closed_at":"2017-01-24T17:03:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Windows 10, VS2015 x64 Native Tools\r\nscons platform=windows\r\n\r\nI get errors about math constants (like M_PI, M_SQRT2) in many files in servers\\audio\\effects.\r\nThe build works if I manually define these constants in core\\typedefs.h\r\n\r\nI supposed it's a compiler specific issue.\r\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4hwaceh6.aspx \r\n\r\n> Math Constants are not defined in Standard C/C++.
