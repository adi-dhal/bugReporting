It would be cool to have a per-shape offset for the tiles.\n\nAlso when using an offset for the texture, the collision shape does not use the on-editor shape offset. Instead it uses half the size of the texture as the offset. I think the collision shape and the texture should have different offsets.\n\nNotice that this is currently fixed by manually editing the tileset shape-offset parameter, but this change is overwritten every time the tileset is exported.\nWhen exporting the tileset insted of using the shape offset within the sprite node (32, 32), it uses half the size of the texture (32, 40).\n\nThis is what happens

The red dot is an enemy. The current navigation classes would probably give path 0 as the best option for the enemy, which might not be possible if the enemy cannot jump that high.
