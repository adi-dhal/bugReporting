making a shader with ShaderGraph and deleting a node that's already connected to the chain, sometimes all other nodes reset their position and \"stick\" to the cursor (often fail to do so). \nFor example, after deleting one of the nodes here, RGB operator stuck to the cursor and moves with a pointer, but it's position is way too far from the pointer. \nThese little glitches are not consistent but occur way too often and ruin the whole structure sometimes.
