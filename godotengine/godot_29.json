Signals / Notifications\r\nWhile the signal-system in Godot works very well in many cases, there is one pattern that I'm personally missing and that is to be able to subscribe globally to signals to receive information without knowing if it will occur or which objects that are emitting it up front. This is more akin to an event system. Godot has some internal notifications that would work - but as far as I know these are predefined and mostly not for use by normal developers.\r\n\r\nThe idea that you can only connect signals explicitly through object and using 1 slot means that it is not as useful as it could be. I miss a mechanism where you can emit some signals globally and you can connect to a global queue without knowledge of objects - just events.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\nAn example - I have a set of objects detecting various objects passing through it (like `Area`-triggers) in one scene. I want to know whenever one of the triggers were firing - both passing through them and also as part of general accumulation and updating of UI.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I see the following solutions to this problem:\r\n1. To iterate through the scene, and connect to these explicitly. But then I consume the signal slot and block it from further access for other objects.\r\n2. In the actual trigger detection - check if the target has a predefined method (`has_method()`) and call it if they have it. But this will imply that you need an object to enter the trigger and possibly route the fnction call further.\r\n3. Other stuff I missed? As mentioned - the notification systems seems mostly like an internal mechanism.\r\n\r\n## Solution suggestions\r\n1. Create a special global queue object that everyone connect and emit to - might be messy.\r\n2. Create new functions for this and call them something else - like *Event* or similar.\r\n3. Expand the existing notification functionality to allow user-defined notifications.\r\n\r\n## Edit\r\nAs pointed out by @Zylann an event bus is more descriptive of what I'm trying to achieve.\r\n* http://timnew.me/blog/2014/12/06/typical-eventbus-design-patterns/\r\n* http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/event-queue.html","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10990","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10990/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10990/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10990/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10990","id":255163509,"number":10990,"title":"Fix unshaded materials render","user":{"login":"MednauN","id":20835548,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/20835548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MednauN","html_url":"https://github.com/MednauN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MednauN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MednauN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MednauN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MednauN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MednauN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MednauN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MednauN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MednauN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MednauN/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279098111,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:rendering","name":"topic:rendering","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-09-05T05:27:57Z","updated_at":"2017-09-05T13:51:36Z","closed_at":"2017-09-05T13:51:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/10990","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10990","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10990.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10990.patch"},"body":"After commit e611ff5f0110210221a6f90250bdd65f5fb3ff2d unshaded materials are rendered pitch-black.
