In my case, the only '+' instance I have is in this line:  aux.set_translation(get_translation()+Vector3(aux.direccion.x,1,aux.direccion.z))\n  2 - In the Replace bar (Ctrl + r), write your desired character and the string you want to replace it. In my case, that would be '+' and ' + '.\n  3 - Press \"Replace All\" (Just \"Replace\" won't produce a crash)\n\nNote: This bug is nor present in Godot_v2.0.3_stable_x11.64\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5935/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5934","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5934/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5934/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5934/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5934","id":167860600,"number":5934,"title":"Cubemap TSCN/TRES","user":{"login":"Elinvention","id":5737945,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5737945?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elinvention","html_url":"https://github.com/Elinvention","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elinvention/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elinvention/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elinvention/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elinvention/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elinvention/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elinvention/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elinvention/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elinvention/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Elinvention/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-07-27T13:58:10Z","updated_at":"2017-03-20T14:39:34Z","closed_at":"2017-03-20T14:27:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\n\nDebian Testing, mesa 12.0.1, godot 2.1.rc1.custom_build\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\n\nCubemaps are broken if saved as a sub-resource in a TSCN scene or as TRES resources.

now dangerously nearing the 2.1 release (it's more or less release ready now, but we should take the time to prepare some proper PR material before announcing it IMO), so here comes the now obligatory issue about making a cool video trailer for Godot 2.1.\n\nHaving such a video would be great for our blog post + maybe landing page + Steam store and, last but not least, for the official press release we'll send all over the world for the press to make some noise about us.\n\nIf we don't manage to make a new video in time for the release, we can of course reuse the games showcase done in #3877; what I have in mind here though is something that would show the editor a bit more, and maybe try to highlight the killer features of Godot as a game engine. If we do have a new video for 2.1, I still plan to use the games showcase for the PR anyway, two videos are better than one ;)\n\nI'll start writing some ideas about the contents in the next comment, please add yours :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5917/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4795","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"C07F:572D:133E7C8:2EC656E:59D69CCF","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=199>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=197>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"23b8cf48638dd649ea23050974431c5b\"","status":"200 OK"}}
