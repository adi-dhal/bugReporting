there a reason the line\n# define BACK_TO_TABLES\n\nis commented out at the top of core/io/aes256.cpp?  From what I can gather, the current code skips the use of lookup tables, and instead calculates the needed data on the fly.  In my roughly measured experiments where I enabled encryption of my scripts, this gives me load times 3-4 times longer than the unencrypted scripts.  If I uncomment this line, so that it uses the lookup tables, I can no longer distinguish between the encrypted and unencrypted load times, which is great.  But I wonder if this is too good to be true, and using the lookup tables is a bad choice for some reason.  I was able to export my scripts encrypted using a slow, non-lookup table built binary, then load that data using the fast lookup table version, so it seems they both work correctly.\n\nShall I make a PR for this, enabling the lookup tables?  Does anyone know enough about this to comment on whether this is a good idea?  I should be able to do this through scons build scripts myself, but if this is an acceptable change, I see no reason to keep doing it the slow way by default.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3011","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3011/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3011/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3011/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/3011","id":120921065,"number":3011,"title":"parse_json
