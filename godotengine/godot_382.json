I can't be sure.. because its difficult to monitor at runtime. There should be a way to get the number of collided objects from RigidBody (like an get_contact_number() : int function). But I'm seeing odd behaviour when an object destroys itself inside a rigidbody set to 'kinematic' where the rb will not register any more contacts after it reaches the maximum set by the user. I'd expect 'freed' contacts to get cleaned up from the contact lists, but it SEEMS they don't.\n\nGenerally its quite important to me to have good 3D collision detection - without full physics simulation. After a lot of experimenting I'm finding the only way to achieve this in Godot is to use Rigidbodies set to 'Kinematic' and use signals to send a collision message to a suitable script elsewhere in the scenegraph.  There has to be a cleaner way.. I notice looking through the APi docs that 2D collision detection is quite well served in this regard. Any plans to extend the 3D collision detection system along similar lines?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/422/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/421","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/421/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/421/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/421/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/421","id":33577787,"number":421,"title":"Capsule CollisionShape","user":{"login":"TheCosmicGoat","id":7535169,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7535169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheCosmicGoat","html_url":"https://github.com/TheCosmicGoat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheCosmicGoat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheCosmicGoat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheCosmicGoat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheCosmicGoat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheCosmicGoat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheCosmicGoat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheCosmicGoat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheCosmicGoat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheCosmicGoat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-05-15T11:42:16Z","updated_at":"2014-05-17T19:45:02Z","closed_at":"2014-05-17T19:45:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When I create a 3D collision object with a capsule collision shape.

there,\nI have created a mockup for a simple ui enhancement. At the moment the shape settings are very hidden in the shape resource itself. You need to open the shaperesource to adjust the shape settings. It took me about 3 month to discover this. Before I always adjusted the shape via the nodes scale values, which resulted in very bad physics behavior.\n\nIn this screenshot I show how this can be exported to the main CollisionShape2D node. Depending on which shape is selected the appropriate shape values are shown.\nI also thought if maybe removing the scale vector from that node, but I don't know if that should be done, or to just set it inactive or something like that.\n\n![collisionshape_ui_enhancement](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6723918/2962884/4ad1e252-dad5-11e3-839b-66231c5a22d0.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/415","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/415/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/415/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/415/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/415","id":33408479,"number":415,"title":"Auto generate editor_icons.cpp to make it easy to update editor icons","user":{"login":"marynate","id":3735467,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3735467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate","html_url":"https://github.com/marynate","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-05-13T15:20:53Z","updated_at":"2014-06-27T06:20:50Z","closed_at":"2014-05-20T23:45:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/415","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/415","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/415.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/415.patch"},"body":"\"editor_icons.cpp\" need to be merged for every new added/modified icons, which is time consuming;\nThis patch make it auto generated in SCons build process.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/414","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/414/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/414/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/414/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/414","id":33406679,"number":414,"title":"IP.resolve_hostname() on Linux","user":{"login":"mrunion","id":5022458,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5022458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrunion","html_url":"https://github.com/mrunion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrunion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrunion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrunion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrunion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrunion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrunion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrunion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrunion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrunion/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":17,"created_at":"2014-05-13T15:02:25Z","updated_at":"2014-08-02T14:02:27Z","closed_at":"2014-08-02T14:02:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The call to IP.resolve_hostname always resolves to 127.0.0.1 on Linux.

I use a texture that's not imported, but referenced directly after I copy it into my resources directory, the repeat flag in the texture's settings will correctly make the texture repeat within the editor on a sprite with an oversized region setting.  However, when I launch the game with F5, the texture does not repeat.  If I save, close the editor and reopen the scene, the texture's repeat flag is no longer enabled.\n\nUbuntu 13.10, Godot v1.0.3917-beta1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/399/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/398","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/398/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/398/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/398/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/398","id":33254973,"number":398,"title":"New created export variable value get lost","user":{"login":"marynate","id":3735467,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3735467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate","html_url":"https://github.com/marynate","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-05-11T04:28:47Z","updated_at":"2014-09-23T00:10:21Z","closed_at":"2014-09-23T00:10:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"How to reproduce:\n1. assign a script to a node, created a new export variable in the script\n\n```\n   export(int) var test_int\n```\n1. assign a value to new created variable, e.g. 100\n2. save and reload the scene, find test_int in property inspector, it's 0 ( should be 100)\n\nAfter the scene reloaded, the value will get serialized properly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/397","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/397/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/397/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/397/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/397","id":33254890,"number":397,"title":"Fix LineEdit selected text drag and drop behavior","user":{"login":"marynate","id":3735467,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3735467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate","html_url":"https://github.com/marynate","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marynate/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-05-11T04:19:35Z","updated_at":"2014-07-07T10:16:56Z","closed_at":"2014-05-11T16:18:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/397","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/397","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/397.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/397.patch"},"body":"- move selected text instead of duplicate them after drag and drop\n- maintain selection after drop\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4612","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"DF10:572C:1532ABA:2A17176:59D6A03C","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=383>;
