preview of the tileset in the tilemap editor was recently improved by @Hinsbart and @bojidar-bg, to make it possible to zoom in and out, which is great.\n\nIf you test [this level of Jetpaca](https://github.com/KOBUGE-Games/jetpaca/blob/master/stages/world_1/forest_fun.tscn) though, you will see that it can become very unwieldy if there is a tile that is disproportioned compared

limiting factor for each tile's scaling. When iterating over all tiles to set their dimensions corresponding to the current zoom factor, if the calculated dimensions are wider than the panel width, we should set the preview of this tile to a custom zoom factor corresponding to the panel width. Other smaller tiles should still be able to be scaled up and down independently of this limiting tile (if possible, even allowing to keep this big tile on a single column even when the smaller tiles start being stacked on several columns at low zoom factors).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4983/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4982","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4982/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4982/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4982/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4982","id":158034873,"number":4982,"title":"Remove Make-related flags from Android build","user":{"login":"vnen","id":5599796,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5599796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen","html_url":"https://github.com/vnen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vnen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097562,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:android","name":"platform:android","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279098009,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:buildsystem","name":"topic:buildsystem","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-06-02T00:18:22Z","updated_at":"2016-06-02T05:23:41Z","closed_at":"2016-06-02T05:23:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/4982","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4982","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4982.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4982.patch"},"body":"They were wrongly placed, creating a file named \"-fpic\" instead of\napplying \"-fpic\" to the build.

am really hesitant to report this, but I ran out of options.\n\nThe issue is that at running the project, when Godot logo with splash screen appears, the nodes `_fixed_process()` function starts. All fine and dandy, but the problem is at the same time collisions doesn't work if there is one at startup! I used manual collision checking for RayCast2D or even Area2D, they fail to report collisions or overlapped areas when there is already one at startup. The collision objects ends up half way through the ground.\n\nI suspected that physics server is not yet loaded and running when the nodes are already moving. What I did and seems to fix it:\n\n```\nonready var testTime = 0\n\nfunc _read():\n    set_fixed_process(true)\n\nfunc _fixed_process(delta):\n    testTime += delta\n    if (testTime < 1):\n        return\n\n ... rest of processing, collision checking .. etc!..\n```\n\nIs this the proper way of fixing it? Why `_ready()` is called when in fact it is not ready?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4958","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4958/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4958/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4958/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4958","id":157725897,"number":4958,"title":"Area Documentation","user":{"login":"P-GLEZ","id":19669392,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/19669392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/P-GLEZ","html_url":"https://github.com/P-GLEZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/P-GLEZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/P-GLEZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/P-GLEZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/P-GLEZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/P-GLEZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/P-GLEZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/P-GLEZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/P-GLEZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/P-GLEZ/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":283518839,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"ffbbff","default":false},{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-05-31T17:25:12Z","updated_at":"2016-05-31T17:34:16Z","closed_at":"2016-05-31T17:34:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/4958","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4958","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4958.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4958.patch"},"body":"Ported the Area2D documentation into its 3D counterpart.
