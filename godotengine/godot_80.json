this is my first contribution in a public repository, please note that I don't completely understand how git works, so expect mistakes in that area. With that out of the way:\r\n\r\n**Initial behavior:** Calls to `ResourceSaver::save(path, resource)` with an edited object from a GDScript editor plugin resulted in the resource being null when it arrived at the C++ function from GDScript.\r\n\r\n**Issue:** The edited object was passed to editor plugins through the edit() function as a Variant, which was constructed by the Variant::Variant(Object*) constructor. However the constructor did not handle the case of the passed Object being a Reference, meaning that the variant was not considered to hold a Reference at that point (Nor a Resource, in the case of `ResourceSaver::save`) so I added a special case for that.\r\n\r\nAlso, I removed the (already commented out), `operator RefPtr()` in reference.h, which seems to have now been replaced by the more direct `operator Variant()`\r\n\r\n**Fixes

They were inaccessible.\r\n\r\nThen I tried adding the following lines to shader_compiler_gles3.cpp:\r\n```cpp\r\n\tactions[VS::SHADER_SPATIAL].renames[\"OMNI_LIGHTS\"] = \"omni_lights\";\r\n\tactions[VS::SHADER_SPATIAL].renames[\"OMNI_LIGHT_INDICES\"] = \"omni_light_indices\";\r\n\tactions[VS::SHADER_SPATIAL].renames[\"OMNI_LIGHT_COUNT\"] = \"omni_light_count\";\r\n\tactions[VS::SHADER_SPATIAL].usage_defines[\"OMNI_LIGHTS\"] = \"#define USE_FORWARD_LIGHTING\\n\";\r\n```\r\nBut the new names (ex: \"OMNI_LIGHTS\") were also inaccessible.  I'm guessing their types also need to be registered in shader_types.cpp, but it looks like theres no way to register struct or array types.  Which is a problem because omni_lights is an array of LightData.\r\n\r\nUnless I hear otherwise, I won't continue working on this as I'm guessing @reduz probably knows how this should be done.\r\n\r\nOr maybe this functionality already exists and I'm totally wrong 😄

is still somewhat experimental but I think its nearly complete.\r\n\r\nWhen exporting your game for Mac OS X from anything but Mac OS X the logic works as with earlier versions of Godot. The app bundle is produced as a zip file. The problem with this is that this app bundle isn't code signed and when unzipping the application is marked as quarantined and won't run. Also the file permissions don't seem to be correct so you'll always end up making at least some changes.\r\n\r\nWhen exporting your game for Mac OS X on a Mac the logic has now changed. The application bundle is optionally signed and then packed up in a DMG. The creation of the DMG is pretty straight forward and could use a few improvements such as adding a background image and adding a link to Applications so you can drag/drop your game. \r\n\r\nCode signing is the experimental bit because Apple is deliberately very unclear on manually code signing applications and what their exact requirements are.\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Procedures/Procedures.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005929-CH4-SW2\r\nThey expect you to use XCode. I'll have to start work on some documentation because manually creating the certificates you need through developer.apple.com and knowing what to download can be tricky.\r\nAlso I have no exposure deploying on the App Store, what I've done should however works for providing applications outside of the App Store and may work if you want to deploy to App Store.\r\n\r\nIn the export window there are now two new fields under a section called CodeSign\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1945449/27769492-fe27d454-5f6d-11e7-9594-3e297c173e72.png)\r\nIdentity should be set to the name of the certificate entry of your signing certificate as its stored in keychain. I'm using my 'Mac Developer' certificate in this screenshot which is fine for testing but you're supposed to use different ones for deploying.\r\n\r\nThe entitlements setting probably isn't implemented fully yet, this allows you to point to an entitlements.plist file that is used along with the signing process but what I do not know is if this entitlements file should also be bundled into your application bundle. The entitlements file lets OSX know what it can expect your application uses, does it open network connections, does it use the camera, etc, and sandbox the application. This is optional if you control the deployment of your app but mandatory if you deploy through the App Store if I understand correctly.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9468/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9467","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9467/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9467/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9467/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/9467","id":240000486,"number":9467,"title":"Script editor search: F3 hotkey for \"next\" conflicts with 3D viewport","user":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":283518733,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"007700","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-07-02T09:53:10Z","updated_at":"2017-07-24T17:45:46Z","closed_at":"2017-07-24T17:45:45Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\r\nLinux x64, Godot *master*\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nWhen doing a text search in the script editor, F3 (supposed to highlight the next match) goes to the 3D viewport.
