about adopting just-in-time (JIT) compilation for GDscripts?\n\nJIT compilation has no disadvantages over interpreted code (aside from slower startup, in some cases) and many advantages, mainly in terms of performance.\n\nFor JIT compilation, there are at least two popular ways to implement it in a cross-platform way without writing any code from scratch:\n- [LLVM Intermediate Representation](http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html)\n- [DynASM](http://luajit.org/dynasm.html), used in LuaJIT\n\nThere is also the option of using PyPy, the JVM or the CLR, but those are quite heavier, using [GNU Lightning](https://www.gnu.org/software/lightning/) or [libjit](https://www.gnu.org/software/libjit/) (not sure if the license is compatible with Godot's) and of course, writing a code generator from scratch (which could take years).\n\nSo, the choice is pretty much between **LLVM IR** and **DynASM**. Both have very good performance, but DynASM is written in Lua and LLVM has a fairly large footprint (~20MB), but also offers other features.\n\nOf course, compiling GDScript directly to C++ could also be a valid alternative - the only game engine which does it that I know of (if I understood it correctly) is [Enigma](http://enigma-dev.org/), which compiles its own scripting language (EDL) to C++.\n\nWhat do you think about this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5049/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5048","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5048/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5048/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5048/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5048","id":158553116,"number":5048,"title":"Added Dictionary.values()","user":{"login":"J08nY","id":1296726,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1296726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/J08nY","html_url":"https://github.com/J08nY","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J08nY/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J08nY/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J08nY/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J08nY/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J08nY/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J08nY/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J08nY/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J08nY/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/J08nY/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-06-05T12:55:31Z","updated_at":"2016-06-07T05:29:15Z","closed_at":"2016-06-06T23:09:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/5048","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5048","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5048.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5048.patch"},"body":"There was no easy way to get an Array of Dictionary values.
