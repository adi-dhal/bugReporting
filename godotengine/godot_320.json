a while I've noticed that my disk was full, that's why the save was corrupted. Anyway GODOT tried to save and didn't report an error, so I guess this is a bug anyway. Leaving old description here just for the sake...**\n\nSo I just got my test scene wrecked by this bug, and since I didn't use GIT or anything.. RIP work :D (maybe use temp .scn files for recovery in the future?)\n\nAnyway, tl;dr - ~~if you add a GDScript resource and not save it, but you save the scene it basically corrupts the scene [1.1stable]~~ (insufficent disk space was the cause of this, GODOT didn't notify about it)\n\nReporduction:\n1. Create a new scene\n2. Create a main node of somekind (doesn't matter which class)\n3. Go to Resources tab, add a resource of type GDScript\n4. Write something in the code editor, for example `extends Node`\n5. Click around the editor, or wait a couple of seconds, the editor's tab name turns into `(*)` which suggests an unexpected behaviour\n6. CTRL+S saves the scene instead of the GDScript file, which is counter-intuitive, anyway save the scene\n7. Try to load the just-saved scene (or load another one and try to load this scene again)\n8. Ooops! `Error loading scene`\n\n~~Result: Scene file is corrupted, overwriting previous work on the scene\nBinary-wise the file has a bit of junk, that's it (a few bytes maybe, truncating the scene completely).~~\n\nWhat I was trying to achieve while finding this bug:\nI wanted to create a GDScript that was not attached to a node right away. I've created a resource, but then I changed my mind so I removed it quickly. I couldnt close the editor's tab (another bug) so I just thought it's a little bug and decided to save the scene and reload the editor.\n\n**EDIT: in short - GODOT doesn't detect full disk space (errors while saving a scene)**\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2280","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2280/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2280/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2280/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2280","id":95954256,"number":2280,"title":"Scene stopped with a bad number of arguments","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279098082,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:gdscript","name":"topic:gdscript","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-07-19T22:27:39Z","updated_at":"2015-11-28T17:15:47Z","closed_at":"2015-11-28T17:15:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"On Linux:\n\n``` GDScript\nclass A:\n    func _init(a):\n        pass\n\nvar a = A.new() #

This appears to be a problem in the remote script debugger.  When a variant is created from an object, the object pointer in the ObjData is initialized, but not the RefPtr.  When the variant is passed across the debugging connection, the remote debugger checks to see if it has a valid reference.  Since there is no reference, it does not retrieve the ObjectID from the object pointer to pass to the GDScript debugger, instead passing \"0\".\n\nWhen I simply remove the RefPtr check in this patch, the ObjectID appears in the GDScript debugger as expected.  The safe_get_instance_id function is only used for the purpose of marshalling objects across the debugging connection, so there doesn't seem to be any harm in removing this check.  Is there a reason for this check that I am missing?  Is it OK to just remove this?\n\nThis \"fix\" corrects the seeming null reference issue reported in #2275.  In this case, find_node returns a Node pointer.  The binding code creates a variant from the Object pointer, which the remote debugger then reports as 0 instead of the Node's ObjectID.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2279/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2278","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2278/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2278/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2278/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2278","id":95871712,"number":2278,"title":"File

from GDScript does not seem to work as intended.  The first issue is that the find_node binding seems to include a copy/paste error in node.cpp:1842, binding to get_node instead of find_node.\n\nThe second issue is a little harder.  When I debug the engine in gdb while stepping over the find_node call, I can see the recursion search for and find a matching node, and return a pointer to the node.  The pointer seems valid until it is returned and assigned to the Variant type in the language binding, and then I don't know enough to continue following.  However, after the GDScript step-over is complete for the find_node call, the godot debugger shows the return of find_node as 0.\n\nI have created an example project that demonstrates this.  To reproduce:\n1. Set a breakpoint on the GDscript find_node call, test.gd:9.  Run the project.\n2. Attach GDB to the child process.\n3. Set a breakpoint on Node::find_node and continue GDB.\n4. Press step-over in the godot debugger.\n5. Once the GDB breakpoint is hit, step though the until the first recursion returns the matching node, to see that it is found.\n6. Continue GDB so that the Godot debugger step can continue.\n7. Examine the returned value in the editor; it is zero.\n\nhttp://fazjaxton.net/files/test3.zip\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2275/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2274","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2274/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2274/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2274/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/2274","id":95566439,"number":2274,"title":"Improve
