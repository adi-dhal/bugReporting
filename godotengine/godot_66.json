Godot 2.x branch is in an odd place in terms of MSVC and Visual Studio.  Godot 2.x doesn't currently support Visual Studio 2017 and Microsoft no longer offers Visual Studio 2015 for download unless you're a Visual Studio subscriber.\r\n\r\nHowever, as usual, Microsoft does provide the compiler and other [build tools for VS2015](http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools) for free, just without VS itself.  Godot's current build scripts however, for whatever reason, check for Visual Studio rather than the presence of the MSVC compiler tool chain.  This PR fixes that.  A similar fix is likely to be required for the master branch.\r\n\r\nEDIT:  Apparently VS2015 is available as part of the free tier of the Visual Studio subscription.  That makes this PR less critical, but it's still worth merging for those that need to target earlier MSVC tool chains without having the associated release of VS installed as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9902/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9901","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9901/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9901/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9901/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/9901","id":245911282,"number":9901,"title":"Unable

By now, it stay modifiable through an enum property, and the ANCHOR_BEGIN, ANCHOR_END and ANCHOR_CENTER are kept as constant. Basically it does not deeply changes the API or the workflow, but it stores the anchor as a float value. (This is the base for other enhancements)\r\n- [x] The margin are now always a vector2 relative to the anchor position, it does not changes sign when it has a value like ANCHOR_CENTER or ANCHOR_END (>=0.5). This means that inner margins on the bottom and right side (with ANCHOR_CENTER or ANCHOR_END anchor) have usually negative values.

The export is done on Linux 64 bit.\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nWhen the LineEdit node has some text and it's selected with select_all(), then the expected behavior is that that text is cleared on backspace or when typing. This works fine in 2.1.2 on Android with a predictive keyboard.\r\n\r\nBut in 2.1.3 what happens is that with a predictive keyboard only one character is removed with backspace (while the entire text is selected) or characters are appended to the current text with typing. Also when there are two words and they are both selected (with select_all()) and backspace is pressed, the first word is deleted and 1 character is removed from the second word.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9879","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9879/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9879/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9879/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9879","id":245738533,"number":9879,"title":"Fix mutating project.godot","user":{"login":"RandomShaper","id":11797174,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11797174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper","html_url":"https://github.com/RandomShaper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandomShaper/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-07-26T14:20:28Z","updated_at":"2017-07-28T10:30:08Z","closed_at":"2017-07-28T09:11:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/9879","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9879","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9879.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9879.patch"},"body":"Namely:\r\n- comment block lost on first save;\r\n- `config_version` doubled as 3 and null on second save;\r\n- format change on first save.\r\n\r\n## Concerns\r\n\r\n- Without the added `p_merge_with_current` parameter set to `false`, the initial settings would have properties for display width and height. that would go away on first save.

But that's not a problem provided it will eventually get converted to binary, is it?\r\n- Also code is added to make the order of the properties be the same between the first and second saves.
