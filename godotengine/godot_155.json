implement iterators on Objects one can bind the `_iter_init` `_iter_next` and `_iter_get` functions in C++ (and gdScript) at the moment.\r\nWhen  it comes to C++ this is slower as it has to be. (about 7 times slower in my tests).\r\n\r\nI suggest adding a `_script_use_iter` flag and add the _iter* as virtual functions to Object.\r\nvariant_op.cpp can then check in its iter_* functions if the flag is set for the specific object and use the old (obj.call(...)) way if it is and the virtual function if not.\r\nThe `_script_use_iter` flag should be set to true by default, so everything behaves exactly the same **except** for Classes extending Object which set the flag to false and thus indicate that they want to handle iterators via the virtual functions. (The `packed_data_container.cpp` could benefit from it f.e.)\r\n\r\nMy proposal would look like this:\r\nhttps://github.com/SleepProgger/godot/commit/c918699e8a69cedab765dbfea829f85b42bb94ce\r\n\r\nI didn't sent a PR yet because i am not sure if i may have messed something up ;), and also if it might be a good idea to use a bitset instead of a simple boolean.\r\nThis way some _iter functions could be implemented/overwritten via script but not all (depending on the use case). This wouldn't bring any performance penalties compared to a boolean.\r\nAnyone thoughts on that ?\r\n\r\nI also did some benchmarks:\r\nTest module and gd script: https://gist.github.com/SleepProgger/6ca1483dadc146f3b70ef8964aa2e581\r\n*Editor mode:*\r\n>\r\n> C++ impl iterator: Needed 325 ms for 1000000. 0.000325 ms per item.\r\n> C++ impl bound functions: Needed 2178 ms for 1000000. 0.002178 ms per item.\r\n> GDscript iterator: Needed 3579 ms for 1000000. 0.003579 ms per item.\r\n> Array: Needed 180 ms for 1000000. 0.000180 ms per item.\r\n\r\n*Release mode:*\r\n> \r\n> C++ impl iterator: Needed 87 ms for 1000000. 0.000087 ms per item.\r\n> C++ impl bound functions: Needed 888 ms for 1000000. 0.000888 ms per item.\r\n> GDscript iterator: Needed 1180 ms for 1000000. 0.001180 ms per item.\r\n> Array: Needed 60 ms for 1000000. 0.000060 ms per item.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7218/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7217","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7217/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7217/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7217/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7217","id":192686648,"number":7217,"title":"Work on asm.js and WebAssembly platforms","user":{"login":"eska014","id":6996191,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6996191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014","html_url":"https://github.com/eska014","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eska014/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279097455,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:html5","name":"platform:html5","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279098255,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:porting","name":"topic:porting","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-11-30T21:37:07Z","updated_at":"2016-12-02T07:56:58Z","closed_at":"2016-12-02T07:56:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/7217","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7217","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7217.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7217.patch"},"body":"In practice, these are the changes:\r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\n -
