As far as I know for people like me there is an option `Open dominant script on Scene change`, when this option is checked for 90% of time the script you are seeing is the script that is related to opened scene and this is cool.\nThe problem occurs in those remaining 10% of time. The most common case when this happens is simply at the time when there is an error in the script:\n![scene_script_relation](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6129594/16733524/2e919490-4782-11e6-9c50-b4ee36c89c3b.png)\nIn this example the error is inside the script that is related to SplashNew.tscn scene, but what I'm seeing when I'm looking at tabs is \"BaseBall.tscn\" and this is confusing me regularly.  \nIt would be super nice if Godot could open scene that's linked to script in which error occur.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very

item is selected. Also, you can't scroll through entries, unless you hover your mouse over the scroll bar or empty space in the list (which isn't how scrolling works, check any scrolling lists in your OS). \n\nWhat should happen: \nWhen you focus on entry that's partially or completely out of bounds of scroll container, it should set it's value to completely show the entry. If you scroll mouse with cursor in bounds of scroll container it should scroll. Pressing PageDown/PageUp should set scroll so only the last/first element is visible on top/bottom of the scroll container. \n\nAt screenshot you can see how the topmost item in list has focus. If you press up, it switches focus to next element without moving the scroll. For controller friendly games it pretty much breaks the usability. \n![clearcolor16](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10696955/16716169/c0afdcf4-46fd-11e6-9419-09cf3cc4e961.png)\n\n[ScrollContainerBuggeh.tar.gz](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/357137/ScrollContainerBuggeh.tar.gz)\nProject for testing.

When the player picks them, I hide them and disable particle emission, because that way it won't \"pop out\" and I can make them respawn easily when the level restarts (which happens a lot).\n\nTo reduce CPU usage, I added VisibilityEnabler2D on pickups so their particles aren't simulated when out of view.\nProblem: disabled pickup started to emit particles again when the player goes back the place where it was, because VisibilityEnabler2D activates them again.\n\nThen, in addition to disable emission, I also turn off VisibilityEnabler2D with this code:\n\n``` gdscript\nget_node(\"VisibilityEnabler2D\").set_enabler(VisibilityEnabler2D.ENABLER_PAUSE_PARTICLES, false)\n```\n\nHowever it doesn't works at all, the enabler continues to enable or disable particles.\nIt works if I disable the enabler from the inspector, but in code I see no change.\n\n**Example project:**\nHere is a test project in which  I disable the enabler from code:\n[ParticlesEnabler.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/356128/ParticlesEnabler.zip)\n\nPress right arrow to move the camera away from the particles. Notice it stops emitting, ignoring the `ENABLER_PAUSE_PARTICLES` setting.\n(I also noticed a kind of margin, the camera has to be further away from the area)\nYou can also notice this when intentionally disabling particles: they will start to emit once in view.\n\n**What was expected:**\n1) VisibilityEnabler2D should work the same in code and inspector\n2) Should pause particle simulation instead of changing emission\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5629","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5629/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5629/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5629/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5629","id":164724145,"number":5629,"title":"Support for control bone removal in Collada exporter","user":{"login":"SaracenOne","id":12756047,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/12756047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne","html_url":"https://github.com/SaracenOne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaracenOne/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-07-10T16:59:26Z","updated_at":"2016-07-10T17:17:11Z","closed_at":"2016-07-10T17:17:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/5629","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5629","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5629.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5629.patch"},"body":"This PR adds support for a feature in spec of the Collada exporter but was not avaliable. Prefixing 'ctrl' to any bone in an armature will now discard it during the export phase. As well as bones at the end of the tree, it can also discard control bones which lie between the root and the rest of  the armature by providing matrix compensation in the animation export. It doesn't remap vertex weights as of yet (though it could probably be added), but that is probably outside the scope of what this feature is meant to provide, specifically just the removal of redundant control bone helpers. I also replaced the matrix 'inverted' methods with 'inverted_safe' which should resolve some exporter crashes with zero bone scaling (the pre-existing workaround does not solve the issue).\n\nShould

have this issue.\nI would suggest they appear at the center of the screen, like Unity3D does with its project manager.\nThis could be a common feature between tools and games, like, have an option for

system or device - Godot version:**\nWindows 8 - Bleeding Edge (454b210242ec15a9928324757f27989216bc5a59)\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nOkay, so a recent update (0db02f26b66ba4e3ac671607ba85fc794ae698fa) introduced some changes to the scene import, but one thing it broke was the running the animation optimizer on scenes as they're imported. The reason specifically for this breaking is because the update made it so that the AnimationPlayer node which is created automatically on scene import had its named changed to 'animations', whereas the method for method for preprocessing animation optimization search for a node with the default name 'AnimationPlayer'. This is obviously incredibly trivial to fix, and I would have already fixed it myself, but I wanted to know whether there was a reason for renaming the AnimationPlayer node, and whether it should be fixed by either reverting the name or have the optimizer method simply search for the node with a new name.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nImport any Collada file with animation using the optimization flag.\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5621","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5621/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5621/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5621/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/5621","id":164711194,"number":5621,"title":"Fix

system or device - Godot version:**\nLinux Mint 18 x64\nGodot 2.0.4 Stable (Linux 64) (download from site)\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nThe editor randomly crashes when I save a script. **It happens only with old projects made in 2.0.3.** I tried 2.0.3 again and confirmed that the issue is only on 2.0.4. Also, it seems to only occur when using the hotkey (ctrl+s) to save the script. I haven't gotten it to crash when using the menu to save (File > Save). I made a new project in 2.0.4 and the issue went away, but when I tried moving over all my important files (*.tscn and *.png) the issue came back. The Control.tscn and Control.gd was made in 2.0.4 and all I did was try and edit and save Control.gd while having Control.tscn open, and it crashed again, even though I haven't even touched the old files from the 2.0.3 project, but before moving over the old files, it worked just fine. I think the issue has something to do with the *tscn files from 2.0.3.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n1. Open any project\n2. Open any script\n3. Make any small change (ex: add/remove newline)\n4. Press ctrl-s to save script\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until it crashes (usually within 5 saves)\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\n[game.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/355855/game.zip)\n\n**Terminal Output** (No actual error messages appeared, but it crashed very time)\nbatmanasb@MintySuitcase ~ $ /home/batmanasb/MEGA/Godot/Godot2.0/Godot_v2.0.4_stable_x11.64\nOPENING: /home/batmanasb/MEGA/Godot/Projects/Rogue Voyage/game (::home::batmanasb::MEGA::Godot::Projects::Rogue Voyage::game)\nVBoxContainer: 136,100\nbatmanasb@MintySuitcase ~ $ bind toptions\nTextureButton: 16,-4\nLabel: 289,63\nHBoxContainer: 70,27\nsettings changed\n^C\nbatmanasb@MintySuitcase ~ $ /home/batmanasb/MEGA/Godot/Godot2.0/Godot_v2.0.4_stable_x11.64\nOPENING: /home/batmanasb/MEGA/Godot/Projects/Rogue Voyage/game (::home::batmanasb::MEGA::Godot::Projects::Rogue Voyage::game)\nVBoxContainer: 136,100\nbind toptions\nbatmanasb@MintySuitcase ~ $ settings changed\nNo completion\n^C\nbatmanasb@MintySuitcase ~ $ \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5619","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5619/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5619/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5619/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5619","id":164696151,"number":5619,"title":"3D WorldEnvironment-CubeMap rotation","user":{"login":"avril-gh","id":3224132,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3224132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/avril-gh","html_url":"https://github.com/avril-gh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avril-gh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avril-gh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avril-gh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avril-gh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avril-gh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avril-gh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avril-gh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avril-gh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avril-gh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":279098111,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:rendering","name":"topic:rendering","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-07-10T02:45:23Z","updated_at":"2016-07-10T02:59:54Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It would be very nice feature if CubeMap (of 3D WorldEnvironment node) could have ability to become rotated.\nThis way it could be very easy to make a moving sky / stars / clouds effect just simply rotating the CubeMap along Y axis.
