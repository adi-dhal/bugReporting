The folder explorer always starts the somewhere obscure (on mine, buried a good few folders deep within the actual godot.app bundle). This also applies to any dialog prompt that requires a file to be located. \r\n\r\n**Example**\r\nI really like the way Game Maker Studio deals with projects. It has a _pre-filled_ directory, pointing to documents>gamemaker>[projectname]. And that default directory can later be customized in settings.\r\n\r\nIt also creates all the assets folders for you, for your sprites, sounds, scripts, etc. But I understand people will have their own conventions, and this might be annoying. But on the flipside, standard conventions are never a bad thing to introduce. It could perhaps be an option.\r\n\r\n**Also**\r\nMacs have this neat feature, where you can drag a directory or a file into the load window, and it will automatically go to that path.
