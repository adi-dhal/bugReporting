The `.png.flags` file, although bundled, is ignored because it cannot be matched any longer with the image file name. *\n\n**_What this PR does_**\n\nWith this PR merged, the export process reads the flags from the `.png.flags` files and sets the corresponding ones in the `.tex` file.\n\nMoreover, the flags file is read on every export and considered for the computation of the hash of the converted file. That way should those flags change from export to export, Godot is aware and knows it has to reconvert them\n\n(*) It would be nice also to prevent these no longer needed flag files from getting into the exported game (work for another PR). Another option would have been to rename or remap these (`.png.flags` -> `.tex.flags`) but as long as the `.tex` format is capable of storing flags I believed that should be the way to go.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6662/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6661","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6661/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6661/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6661/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6661","id":180334591,"number":6661,"title":"Crash on attempt to edit SoundPlayer2D with broken dependencies","user":{"login":"syskrank","id":11526664,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11526664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syskrank","html_url":"https://github.com/syskrank","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syskrank/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syskrank/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syskrank/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syskrank/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syskrank/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syskrank/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syskrank/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syskrank/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syskrank/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-09-30T15:35:02Z","updated_at":"2016-09-30T16:57:17Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\nlinux debian stable ( 8 ) x64;

In TSCN it looks like this:\n`[connection signal=\"body_enter\" from=\"Enemy\" to=\".\" method=\"_on_Enemy_body_enter\"]`\nDisconnecting and reconnecting again fixes it, and changes the TSCN to:\n`[connection signal=\"body_enter\" from=\"Enemy\" to=\"Enemy\" method=\"_on_Enemy_body_enter\"]`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6655","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6655/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6655/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6655/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6655","id":180192550,"number":6655,"title":"sub window focus and autoswitching is confusing","user":{"login":"raould","id":77176,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/77176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raould","html_url":"https://github.com/raould","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raould/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raould/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raould/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raould/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raould/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raould/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raould/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raould/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raould/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":283518733,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"007700","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-09-30T00:06:15Z","updated_at":"2016-10-11T05:55:46Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\nlinux ubuntu 16.04.1 lts 64 bit running mate wm (not ubuntu wm)\nv2.1.stable.official\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nthe relationship among the sub-windows is confusing.\n\nit sorta makes sense to me that when i switch to a different scene tab, the central editor window changes to whatever i was last working on the scene, ok.\n\nbut the reverse doesn't happen: if i use the left/right arrows of the central editor pane to go back through history of scripts i've been editing, it doesn't change the scene tab, and it doesn't change the tree.\n\nwhich means i can easily get confused/worried/lost about \"wait am i editing the right file?

E.g. browsers start off with a white page background with black text by default. (a) If I like white then Godot is different and that is annoying. (b) if I use a screen color inverter (which i do) to make most everything become darker, so that the browser pages are now white text on black background, then Godot is now bright which is annoying. In other words if an app has a different default color relationship of fg + bg vs. the standards (which in this day and age means whatever web browsers do by default) i think it is not good ux. (i mean same goes for lightroom or whatever else.)\n\nnote that (depending on what system was used to invert system colors) things sometimes get worse because of Godot's cross platform nature, is my guess: the I-bar text caret mouse cursor doesn't get the color changed for some reason so then i end up with a white on white mouse cursor in the text editor! but the arrow mouse cursor does get inverted properly. etc. etc. etc.\n\n(thanks for a great fun program.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6653","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6653/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6653/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6653/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6653","id":180127631,"number":6653,"title":"remove

There are though, in my opinion, 2 limitations:\n- It does not allow to optimize the network usage by not exposing multiple **ENet channels** (see http://enet.bespin.org/Features.html#Channels )\n- It does not allow to test both client and server in the same instance.\n\nI'm opening this issue since I'd like some **feedback** from the community and the developers regarding the new features and the design.\n# Proposal\n\nMy proposal is composed by two parts:\n## Expose channels\n\nReserve the 2 channels already in use by Godot and allow to specify the number of custom channels to be used in `create_server` and `create_client` (minimum 1)\n- All calls to `put_packet(packet,len)` will send the packet to the first custom channel\n- SceneTree will call `put_packet(packet,len,CHANNEL)` (where CHANNEL is currently 0 and is reserved)\n- From GDScript `put_packet_channel(packet,channel)` will be available in order to send the packet on `channel + first_custom_channel`\n- SceneTree will emit `network_peer_packet(sender:int,channel:int,packet:RAW_ARRAY)` when receiving a packet on a custom channel. In this case `channel` will be `actual_channel - first_custom_channel`\n\n(I have this partially implemented already in a private repo, I'm still cleaning up the code. See note 1 for a more detailed description)\n\nThis will keep the compatiblity with the current system, it will still not allow to test multiple clients on the same scene, but will enable the user to have multiple channels available for any custom data he'd like to send.\n\nThis brings us to the second proposal.\n## Expose Poll and create NetworkedMultiplayerNode\n- Shuoldn't we expose the `poll()` method of `NetworkedMultiplayerENet` to GDScript?\n- Create a `NetworkedMultiplayerNode` that mimics the current behaviour of `SceneTree` concerning polling and handling network signals (including the new `network_peer_packet`)\n- Possibly expand the node behaviour also to mimic the scene synchronizations with relative node paths (probably a long shot).\n\n---\n# Notes\n## Note 1 - Details of phase one\n- Add `RESERVED_CHANNELS` pre-compiler define to `NetworkedMultiplayerPeer` (the first reserved channel, that is also the number of reserved channels)\n- Add function `put_packet(packet,len,channel)` to `NetworkedMultiplayerPeer`\n- Override `put_packet(packet,len)` with a call to `put_packet(packet,len,RESERVED_CHANNELS)` in `NetworkedMultiplayerENet` (so default GDScript binding will send the packet on the first custom channel)\n- Add function `get_packet_channel()` to `NetworkedMultiplayerPeer` (it works, like `get_sender`, on the next incoming packet)\n- Update `SceneTree` to use `put_packet(packet,len,0)` (0 is the channelID already in use)\n- Update `SceneTree` to emit signal `network_peer_packet(sender:int,channel:int,packet:RAW_ARRAY)` packets on `channel >= RESERVED_CHANNELS`\n- Add function `put_packet_channel(packet, channel)` to `NetworkedMultiplayerENet` GDScript binding (the default `put_packet(packet)` will send the packet on the first not reserved channel) \\\n  Note: All GDScript references to `channel` will be considered as `channel + RESERVED_CHANNELS`\n## Note 2\n\nExample to test udp network code stability locally with iptables (20% packet loss simulated).\n\n```\niptables -A INPUT -p udp --sport SERVER_PORT -m statistic --mode random --probability 0.2 -j DROP\niptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport SERVER_PORT -m statistic --mode random --probability 0.2 -j DROP\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6642/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6641","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6641/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6641/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6641/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6641","id":180033987,"number":6641,"title":"Astar node id to be a string or variant","user":{"login":"cefleet","id":3854829,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3854829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cefleet","html_url":"https://github.com/cefleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cefleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cefleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cefleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cefleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cefleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cefleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cefleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cefleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cefleet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-09-29T12:21:56Z","updated_at":"2016-10-04T13:14:06Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Pretty straight forward.

You might be wondering, why in the world?\n\nWell, the reason is somehow you need to have a random `yield(get_tree(), \"idle_frame\")` right before printing.  Like so:\n\n```\nextends RichTextLabel\nfunc _ready():\n    yield(get_tree(), \"idle_frame\")\n    print(get_v_scroll().is_visible())\n```\n\nMy suggestion is.. can't this `yield(get_tree(), \"idle_frame\")` be done behind the scenes for us? And can also give us the option to use it when we need? I know it advances towards the next frame and yields for it: http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/reference/gdscript.html#coroutines-signals\n\nBut for newer people, and I can contest to this.. I was stuck developing a user interface for my fairly large game now for hours trying to figure out why some ui elements weren't working. And then I suddenly added  the `idle_frame` yield at the top of whatever code and it worked miraculously.\n\nThere was also another instance earlier where I was tweening a RichTextLabel and it had a weird blink for the first 0.5ms of the transition then any other new tweens / messages were fine. I spent almost an hour looking at what it could be. It turned out I just needed a `idle_frame` yield right before it.  \n\nYeah, I understand the need for it and I like it. But I feel like if we could somehow get it to work behind the scenes for most basic stuff (like my example code above), newer people won't have problems with it.  Especially when developing rich user interfaces. Maybe we should add somewhere in the docs that `idle_frame` is your best friend? :)  Especially when working with UI elements.\n\nEdit: The point I am getting at is really about the example code above. If I were brand new, I would have absolutely no idea that I would need a `idle_frame` yield there. I just don't want other new people to share this fate. I would have most likely made a bug issue about it, and waste the time of other developers.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6638/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6637","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6637/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6637/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6637/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/6637","id":179930899,"number":6637,"title":"Windows: prevent huge prints from crashing the engine","user":{"login":"Zylann","id":1311555,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1311555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann","html_url":"https://github.com/Zylann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":205417413,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:windows","name":"platform:windows","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/6","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/6/labels","id":1807486,"number":6,"title":"2.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":263,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-06-03T16:13:32Z","updated_at":"2017-09-18T11:53:44Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2017-09-18T11:53:44Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-09-29T01:24:32Z","updated_at":"2016-09-29T07:31:52Z","closed_at":"2016-09-29T07:31:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/6637","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/6637","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/6637.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/6637.patch"},"body":"This snippet makes the engine crash on windows:\n\n``` gdscript\nfunc _ready():\n    var dic = {}\n    for y in range(0, 40):\n        for x in range(0, 40):\n            dic[Vector2(x,y)] = randi()%10\n    print(dic)\n```\n\nIt was caused by an out-of-bound access of a fixed-size buffer, which is later used for widechar conversion.\nvsnprintf can actually return values greater than the provided length, as a count, even if it doesn't writes all the characters: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/vsnprintf/\n\nObviously the data is too big, but it should not make the engine crash.\nThis fix only prevents the crash to happen.
