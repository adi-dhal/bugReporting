@Hinsbart) I'm seeing this behavior (with a PS3 pad on linux)\n- press a button, which triggers a call to load() that blocks the main thread for 1 second\n- during that second, release the button\n- after the load() is finished and the main loop is back to number, the release event doesn't seem to be generated\n- press the button again, the event is not generated again\n- release the button, the release event is generated\n\nThere seems to be 2 bugs, the first lost event is during the time where the main thread is blocked (for example while loading a new level, etc). The 2nd lost event, could it be because the engine thinks the button is already pressed so it omits it? This is ok to do for axis values and mouse movement, but we shouldn't do it for buttons.. We want to send every event that happened, even if the end result is the same state that we previously had. Users are not fast enough, so we won't have more than 2 or 3 events from the same button in one frame (and in that case, the FPS has to be _very_ low).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3727/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4722","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"E3FC:6E61:F7CB4B:1FD68F8:59D69DFF","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=272>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=396>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=270>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"1750544a582d92200fca6a7e4ea12c03\"","status":"200 OK"}}
