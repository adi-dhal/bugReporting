Instead, the first point is set fixed after reaching bake interval the first time.\n\nFor example: adding points Vector2(0,0)...Vector2(13,0) with bake interval set to 10 will end in baked points: Vector2(10.000001,0) and Vector2(13,0).\n\nThe last point is always alternating, until a new interval is reached, what feels fine. But I think, that the starting point of the curve must not be alternating.\n\n[curve2d_demo.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/128000/curve2d_demo.zip)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3689","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3689/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3689/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3689/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3689","id":133221795,"number":3689,"title":"*
