system or device, Godot version, GPU Model and driver (if graphics related):**\r\nArch linux; Godot 3.0 master branch\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nI am trying to remove rigid body when it collides with other.\r\nIt stops the process if I use node.free() or node.remove_and_skip() or node.get_parent().remove_child(node)\r\nI understand, that I should use node.queue_free(), but process should not stops without any error. But it does.\r\n\r\nWhen I tried to debug process, I found an issue:\r\nin file space_2d_sw.cpp (I added comments on lines):\r\n\r\n\tvoid Space2DSW::call_queries() {\r\n\t\twhile (state_query_list.first()) {\r\n\r\n\t\t\tBody2DSW *b = state_query_list.first()->self();\r\n\t\t\tb->call_queries(); // as I understand from this callback body will be freed\r\n\t\t\tstate_query_list.remove(state_query_list.first()); // and here state_query_list.first() is null and it fails in remove() method\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\twhile (monitor_query_list.first()) {\r\n\r\n\t\t\tArea2DSW *a = monitor_query_list.first()->self();\r\n\t\t\ta->call_queries();\r\n\t\t\tmonitor_query_list.remove(monitor_query_list.first());\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nI think, that it is better to store state_query_list.first() in variable to remove it correctly after b->call_queries()\r\n\r\nAnd other problem, that process stops without any error. So it was pretty hard to find root of the problem. So maybe it should write an error to the output.\r\n\r\n**Example

may be just a single uniform declaration and nothing else.\r\nit is caused by reimport for 3d\r\n\r\nUPD: as soon as i select the texture, it appears on the mesh (when using standard shader for example) but after this, editor starts reimport and crashes. seems strange now, after i've noticed that texture is applyed to the mesh first.\r\n\r\nUPD2: tried to reimport the texture with '3D'

think there are some ways the output could be improved. I'm interested in what you think and if you have other suggestions.\r\n\r\n1. At the moment the output area just displays text. But you can't really tell where the `print()`-call came from. In unity for example it shows the file name and the line number. And you can also double click the text to jump directly to the `print()`-call (as described here #10566 ).\r\n2. The next thing in unity is, that there are different versions of logs. You can use `Debug.Log()`, `Debug.LogWarning()` and `Debug.LogError()`. These logs show up with different icons leading the text and the text is a different color. You can also selectively toggle which types of logs should be displayed. Even though this is quite nice to have 3 different options to select from, I think it would be quite interesting to go one step further. Maybe let us create our own tags to use. You could select an icon for these tags and set a specific color. And some kind of filtering mechanism would also be helpful.\r\n3. In unity you can use rich text markup to add different styles to the string. I'm not sure if this is necessary, but it just crossed my mind when thinking about improving the output.\r\n4. Another feature from unity is that you can use a game-object as a second parameter, like so `public static void Log(object message, Object context);`. When clicking only once on the output-log it highlights this object in the scene-hierarchy. In godot it could bring up the remote-inspector and show the context-object selected in the live scene tree.\r\n\r\nI know I mentioned a lot of unity-like behavior, but I think many developers could benefit from some of these features.
