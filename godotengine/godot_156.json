find Godot's random number generation methods to be somewhat lacking.\r\nI think for a game engine, there should be more random number generation methods built-in.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if Godot implemented something like this:\r\nhttps://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html\r\n\r\nI've never written Python but since GDScript is based on it, I looked up what rng features Python had, and it looks a lot better than what GDScript has.\r\n\r\nWhat is needed is a class like that that can encapsulate random number generation from a specified seed. Right now what we have are methods that use a shared global seed - but in game dev, you need separate RNGs with separate seeds for things such as an RNG for randomly generating procedural worlds with a 'world seed', another RNG for particles and non-important stuff - etc.\r\n\r\nI have tried using ```rand_seed``` ... but there is no documentation on what type it returns (it looks like an int) and no documentation on the possible range.\r\n\r\nSo again, it would be great if Godot could provide an easy to use and optimized RNG class in GDScript encapsulating a seed and exposing methods such as\r\n\r\n_init(seed = -1) - allows initializing the seed upon construction, default value means random seed\r\nrand() - returns float 0-1\r\nrandi(max)\r\nrandf(max)\r\nrandf_range(from, to)\r\nrandi_range(from, to)\r\n\r\nand even other methods like Python provides such as\r\n\r\n(using Python's names)\r\nchoice(array) - returns a random element in the array\r\nsample(n, array) - returns new array with n elements randomed from input array\r\nshuffle(array) - shuffle the array in place\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\nI was about to build a class like this built on ```rand_seed```, but as noted, I don't even know what range the values can be. Also I'm not sure what algorithm is being used for it and how good it is.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7198","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7198/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7198/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7198/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7198","id":191863563,"number":7198,"title":"Fix

is a bit of a minor feature request for GDScript.\r\n\r\nTo help mitigate really long lines, it would be nice if you could write method chains on multiple lines, rather than being forced to have it all go on a single line. An example of this could be the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# go from this\r\nblock_size = get_node(\"Block\").get_texture().get_size()\r\n\r\n# to this\r\nblock_size = get_node(\"Block\")\r\n\t.get_texture()\r\n\t.get_size()\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the use of an indentation level to indicate that the chain belongs to the line above.\r\n\r\nDoing this would let you write a really long method chain (if needed) without needing intermediate variables to store parts of the chain.\r\n\r\nAs the title suggests, this could also be useful in things like argument lists:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# going from this\r\nRect2((block_size + 255) / 2, door_width)\r\n\r\n# to something like this\r\nRect2 (\r\n\t(block_size + 255) / 2,\r\n\tdoor_width )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way if you're working with a super long argument list, you can break it up onto multiple lines to give a better overview.\r\n\r\nHaving to scroll sideways to be able to read the code isn't always super ideal, and not everyone has ultrawide monitors to work on, so this kind of breaking the code apart would be a nice addition.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7197/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7196","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7196/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7196/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7196/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/7196","id":191845119,"number":7196,"title":"AnimationPlayer timeline scrollbar not functioning properly.","user":{"login":"avencherus","id":13004169,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/13004169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/avencherus","html_url":"https://github.com/avencherus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avencherus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avencherus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avencherus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avencherus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avencherus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avencherus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avencherus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avencherus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avencherus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":283518733,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"007700","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-11-27T06:27:31Z","updated_at":"2016-11-28T14:32:27Z","closed_at":"2016-11-28T14:32:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm using Windows 64 version of v2.1.1\r\n\r\nIn the AnimationPlayer, whenever I drag on the timeline's slider, it will only jump from end to end.

is a double linked list in godots source code (*core/list.h*).\r\nIt would be nice if that would be exposed as there are some cases where a double linked list performs way better as a vector

(Although i could try to mirror the behavior of the Array class).\r\nBasically exposing the list<Variant*> and list<Variant*>::Element should do the trick i guess .?\r\nImplementing it as iterable should also work similar to how Array does it.\r\n\r\nAdditionally (and if requested i could open another issue for this) exposing the core/ring_buffer.h as queue would also be nice for queue needs.\r\nIt should perform better as a queue using a double linked list (and def. better as a vector based list) with the limitation that it has a \"fixed\" size and potential allocates unused memory ofc.\r\nBut there are cases where exactly this behavior is

I can register them by switching to english keyboard but then when I switch back to Slovak, the buttons don't work in-game.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nUse Slovak Keyboard layout and see yourself.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7181","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7181/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7181/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/7181/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7181","id":191530017,"number":7181,"title":"Set minimum version to 10.9 building OSX","user":{"login":"BastiaanOlij","id":1945449,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1945449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij","html_url":"https://github.com/BastiaanOlij","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279097780,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/platform:osx","name":"platform:osx","color":"dddddd","default":false},{"id":279098009,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:buildsystem","name":"topic:buildsystem","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-11-24T14:14:47Z","updated_at":"2016-11-24T15:06:06Z","closed_at":"2016-11-24T15:06:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/7181","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7181","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7181.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7181.patch"},"body":"Since XCode 6 Apple has only supplied the latest SDK with a macro switch to support earlier versions of the OS.
