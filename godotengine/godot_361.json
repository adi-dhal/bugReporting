function findNearestTargetZombie() returns a dictionary that is properly filled with two non-null values.\n\nWhen accessing the key directly in the function call to sendProjectile(), as in this example below, the game crashes without an error message (except Debug Process Stopped).\n\nIf I assign these two dictionary valus to two separate vars before using them, everything works fine.\n\n```\n            var targetZombieIntel = findNearestTargetZombie()\n\n            if (targetZombieIntel[\"targetZombie\"] != null):\n                sendProjectile(currentWeapon, targetZombieIntel[\"shortestDistance\"])\n```\n\nThe function returns a dictionary:\n\n```\nfunc findNearestTargetZombie():\n    var heroPos = self.get_translation() + self.get_parent_spatial().get_translation()\n\n    var targetZombie = null\n    var shortestDistance = null\n\n        # code for finding zombies\n\n    var found = {\"targetZombie\": targetZombie, \"shortestDistance\": shortestDistance}\n    return found\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1039","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1039/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1039/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1039/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/1039","id":52754402,"number":1039,"title":"Code

so it seems like code completion only works for built-in classes and types.
