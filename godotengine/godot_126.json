They are, however, displayed fine both in the editor and in game with the 'visible collision shapes' option enabled.\r\n\r\nFurther inspection confirms that the NodePath of the collision shape does point to the base scene's resource while the game is running.\r\n\r\nThe expected behaviour is of course that the scenes use their own collision shapes when overridden.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nCreate a scene with a `KinematicBody2D` root, and a `CollisionShape2D` helper node. In that node, create a `CircleShape2D` resource of radius 32. Save as `A.tscn`\r\n\r\nCreate an `A.tscn` inherited scene, `B.tscn`. In the inherited `CollisionShape2D` node, create a new `CircleShape2D` resource of radius 16. Save.\r\n\r\nCreate `Main.tscn`and instance both A and B. Turn on visible collision shapes. Both the editor and running game will show the expected collision shapes. But B will still reference A's collision shape, as you can test with any collision.\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\n[InheritedSceneResources.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/859115/InheritedSceneResources.zip)\r\n\r\nRemember to turn on visible collision shapes when testing this project. That sprite following the mouse cursor will turn red when over a shape, I figured it'd make the issue easier to see.\r\n\r\nIf you take a peek at the console, I've printed the shape resources' NodePaths.

PR adds support for reading the gravity vector sensor. This is a vector the OS calculates from the accelerometer sensor with some nice math to filter out any user vibration/movement. It is very useful in getting a more accurate \"down\" vector for stabilizing device orientation or for getting an approximate user movement by subtracting this vector from the accelerometer output.\r\n\r\nMainly it's added to create parity with the core motion changes we did for iOS for issue #7503 \r\n\r\nIn theory the test project I did for coremotion should work to test this as well:\r\nhttps://github.com/BastiaanOlij/TestCoreMotion\r\n\r\nDue to lacking a suitable android device that actually has these sensors I've not been able to actually test this so I'm hoping someone with device that has all 3 sensors could give this a go?\r\n\r\nAnd since @akien-mga refactored half the 2.1 branch this probably works in Godot 3 too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8088/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8087","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8087/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8087/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8087/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/8087","id":215348003,"number":8087,"title":"Preparing for 2.1.3-stable","user":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279097162,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/discussion","name":"discussion","color":"ee77ee","default":false},{"id":362483476,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/tracker","name":"tracker","color":"f9d0c4","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":20,"created_at":"2017-03-20T07:46:38Z","updated_at":"2017-04-25T15:39:44Z","closed_at":"2017-04-25T15:39:44Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"It's time to work on stabilising the 2.1 branch again so that we can release 2.1.3-stable.\r\n\r\n2.1.2 was two months ago, and since 3.0 is taking its time, many devs have pushed some development work to the 2.1 branch directly, so we'll need to do some more extensive testing -

the addition of dynamic libraries as scripts (soon, hopefully 😜 ) it would be nice to have a proper versioning system for the class API and also different modules in use.\r\nThis could also benefit custom modules, as those have no proper versioning system and might or might not work across Godot versions. \r\n\r\nI suggest using semantic versioning for that as it's super cool to programmatically check for compatibility between versions.\r\n\r\nFor example an \"API version\" could be defined as (arbitrary versions)\r\n```gdscript\r\n{\r\n    \"version\": \"3.0.2\",\r\n    \"modules\": {\r\n        \"my_custom_module\": \"1.1.0\",\r\n        \"enet\": \"1.3.0\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA script (or even modules) could then check if the API they need to properly work is compatible with the one Godot currently offers.\r\n\r\n```GDScript\r\nvar required_version = {\r\n    \"version\": \"3.0.0\",\r\n    \"modules\": {\r\n        \"my_custom_module\": \"1.0.0\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nif not Engine.is_version_compatible(required_version):\r\n    # warn the user or something like that\r\n```\r\nIn this case those versions would be compatible because the major version is compatible and every module that's required is present and the version is matching.\r\n\r\nThe asset lib could check for those versions as well and refuse to download assets or plugins (or at least give a warning) if versions don't match etc.\r\n\r\nWDYT?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8083/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8082","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8082/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8082/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8082/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/8082","id":215305789,"number":8082,"title":"Crash
