issue are actually multiple related issues combined. A very tough nut for me to crack, but it got me into looking at the godot source, so I guess that's a good thing. But I'm stuck, so please help me out a bit.\n\nAnyway, in an [example project](http://cutpi.com/jlm), I created a scene containing two instances of KinematicBody2D which overlap. Both bodies are on layer 1, but without a mask. That's why they do not affect each other.\n\nIn the [scene script](https://gist.github.com/ZuBsPaCe/f0832c1989b570c61764) I'm using Physics2DDirectSpaceState.intersect_shape(query) to determine, if both bodies overlap. In the query I am setting the layer mask to 1, but I do not get any results, which is wrong.\n\nThis appeared to me in a project created in godot 1.1, where everything worked fine. This bug was introduced somewhere around the 26/27 Mai (See commit [9df77d2](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/9df77d2) and following) after introducing threaded physics. I figured out, that this bug only happens, if the project property \"physics_2d/thread_model\" is set to Single-Safe or Multi-Threaded. Single-Unsafe works fine.\n\n**What worries me is, that Single-Safe is the new default for new and existing projects.** So everyone using such queries will be affected. By looking at the code I believe, that collide_shape, cast_motion and rest_info are affected, too. I could provide a pull request if you like, but I'm not sure if I'm the right person for this job, maybe @reduz could take a look first? \n\n**It is also questionable, that Single-Safe is the default setting.** Does this provide any benefit compared to Single-Unsafe?\n\n**Additionally, there's a problem running the example project with thread_model Multi-Threaded**. I'm running into AccessViolations within hash_map.get_entry, but not on every start. Maybe 1 out of 4 starts, so you need to try multiple times. The 2D demo 'dynamic collision shapes' (the one with the yellow balls falling) is also affected when run as Multi-Threaded and crashes after a few seconds. I tried to debug this, but I have no clue where to look. Probably one thread is moving/removing stuff which another one needs to access, but this is just a guess. I hope, that maybe someone else could take a look.\n\n(Edit: Updated Example Project link.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2760/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2759","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2759/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2759/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2759/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2759","id":116071735,"number":2759,"title":"Don't

(There might be other types that have this issue, these are the ones I've found). I'll try to illustrate...\n\nI put a few Control nodes under a Render Target viewport and few above it and this is what it SHOULD look like\n![howitshouldlook](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15483613/11039252/5302dbee-86cc-11e5-804b-e88e515e5411.png)\n\nHowever this is what it does instead\n![output](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15483613/11039034/729ed33c-86cb-11e5-9d0d-427f6353399f.png)\n\nThe white/black squares are texture frames and are working correctly. The white ones are children of the Render Target viewport and the black ones are not but they just show that they line up as intended.\n\nThe red box, the green box with the gradient, and the second (not visible) RichTextLabel are all children of a Render Target viewport, the  blue box, the first box with the image of the gradient, and the first RichTextLabel are not. In fact, here's what the scene looks like...\n![scene](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15483613/11039466/6f5768fe-86cd-11e5-97a7-f00e67a43990.png)\n\nI actually just used a big `draw_rect` to locate the wandering nodes. At first it appeared as though the nodes just weren't showing up at all.\n\nAlso worth mentioning that I forgot to show is that the boxes move when the window is resized. If the window is resized just a little they'll move down a little more. They move out of the window entirely before it's even twice as tall. And it's just like... the clipping rectangle that moves. For example, in the green box with the gradient image, the image and scroll bar will stay where they are, the visible area will just move so that it shows less and less of them.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2757/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2756","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2756/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2756/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/2756/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/2756","id":115773240,"number":2756,"title":"UDP fixes","user":{"login":"trond","id":217357,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/217357?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trond","html_url":"https://github.com/trond","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trond/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trond/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trond/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trond/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trond/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trond/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trond/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trond/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trond/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/1/labels","id":1381437,"number":1,"title":"2.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":444,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-10-28T13:37:45Z","updated_at":"2017-07-28T10:44:22Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2017-07-28T10:44:22Z"},"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-11-09T00:43:29Z","updated_at":"2015-11-19T22:33:04Z","closed_at":"2015-11-19T22:33:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/2756","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/2756","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/2756.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/2756.patch"},"body":"Fixed a couple of issues with PacketPeerUDP:\n- recvfrom was getting wrong buffer sizes causing disconnects.\n- recvfrom could get wrong buffer sizes due to signed<->unsigned conversion.\n- disconnects were caused by WSAECONNRESET-error, which normally should be ignored (the udp chat example is difficult to try on Windows due to this).

now RayCast Node and raycast API for Camera Node can only accept exceptions which they omit when they are doing collision check.\nIt would be greatly useful to have there something opposite for this

using get_tree().get_nodes_in_group() to find objects that I want to ignore.
