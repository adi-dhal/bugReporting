3.0 pre-alpha master\r\nWindows 10 64 bits MSVC\r\n\r\nI am making an `opensimplex` GDNative plugin that registers a `Noise` class inheriting Reference (not a node script, unlike the news shows). \r\nSo I compiled my library as a `.dll` using the C++ kit, and put it in the project with GDNaive libraries as well.\r\n\r\nThen I created these resources:\r\n`opensimplex.tres`, which references my `.dll` (and other platforms in the future),\r\n`noise.gdn`, which is a resource referencing the `Noise` class within my library.\r\n\r\nHowever, the following didn't work:\r\n\r\n```gdscript\r\nconst OsnNoise = preload(\"res://addons/zylann.opensimplex/noise.gdn\")\r\n\r\nfunc _ready():\r\n\tvar noise = OsnNoise.new()\r\n```\r\n`Invalid call. Nonexistent function 'new' in base 'GDNativeScript'.`\r\n\r\n@karroffel told me the `new` method might indeed be missing.\r\n\r\n-----------------\r\n**The following is wrong due to earlier confusion based on a wrong guess.**\r\n\r\nHowever, I got confused when I went to create an instance of my class in GDScript. Apparently, as @karroffel told me, the `.gdn` already is an instance of the `Noise` class. So getting the instance looks like this:\r\n\r\n```gdscript\r\nvar noise = load(\"noise.gdn\")\r\n```\r\nBut there are numerous things I find wrong with it:\r\n\r\n1) It is inconsistent compared to how GDScript classes usually work. From my experience using GDScript, a `.gd` file behaves as a `Resource` containing a *class*, not an *instance*. So instancing it actually look like this:\r\n```gdscript\r\nconst Klass = preload(\"klass.gd\")\r\nvar obj = Klass.new()\r\n```\r\nAnd if the Klass inherit a `Node`, you should get a node instance with the script on it. Same for Resources I guess.\r\n\r\n\r\n2) It makes class constants harder to access, because they are usually bound as \"static\" members of the class. However with this you are forced to get the constant from an instance of the class, instead of the class itself. Again, in GDScript, this is how it looks:\r\n```gdscript\r\nconst Klass = preload(\"klass.gd\")\r\nprint(Klass.SOME_CONSTANT)\r\n# or\r\nprint(Mesh.PRIMITIVE_TRIANGLES)\r\n```\r\n\r\n3) Creating an instance from scratch is too complicated, or requires to create a `.gdn` file which would look like a singleton.\r\nWithout a file, this is the code required (pure guess, this code actually doesn't work for some reason, although the same process happens in the editor when creating a `.gdn` file. @karroffel tell me if I'm wrong on this one):\r\n```gdscript\r\nvar noise = GDNativeScript.new()\r\nnoise.library = preload(\"opensimplex.tres\")\r\nnoise.script_name = \"Noise\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I would expect is for the .gdn file to represent a class, not an instance, and to be able to create instances the following way:\r\n\r\n```gdscript\r\nconst Noise = preload(\"noise.gdn\")\r\nvar noise = Noise.new()\r\n```~~ ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8432/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8431","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8431/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8431/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8431/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/8431","id":222039732,"number":8431,"title":"[GDNative] `const` functions cannot be registered","user":{"login":"Zylann","id":1311555,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1311555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann","html_url":"https://github.com/Zylann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zylann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false},{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":580537003,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:gdnative","name":"topic:gdnative","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-04-16T23:22:15Z","updated_at":"2017-04-16T23:51:27Z","closed_at":"2017-04-16T23:51:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Godot 3.0 pre-alpha master\r\nWindows 10 64 bits MSVC\r\n\r\nWhen making a GDNative library using the C++ kit, I figured out C++ functions declared as `const` produce compilation errors when used in method bindings.

ASTC support on PC is limited to Intel, and on mobile is limited to Tegra and Mali, but support for it will likely improve over time.\r\n\r\nRegardless, both share a design challenge: They permit size/quality tradeoffs that break the assumption that there is a single optimal VRAM-compressed format for an image.  ASTC does this by having configurable block sizes, and BPTC does this by being higher quality than DXT1 on RGB-only data, but at twice the size (unlike DXT5, which has no quality advantage over DXT1 on RGB).\r\n\r\nSo, it would make sense to apply a quality option to images exported to VRAM formats in addition to lossy.  For BPTC, this would mean switching to DXT1 for RGB below some threshold.

After I updated Windows 10, Godot crashes on the startup immediately, It doesn't even reach the project manager. Unfortunately the console does not print any errors either. Both the stable and the master branch seem to be affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:** I am not sure if it happens for everyone but the issue pretty much started after I updated to Windows 10 Creator. I can imagine this is not something anyone wanted to read today...\r\n\r\n![yay](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18212852/25065141/ec4c671e-2209-11e7-9e3a-aa4b7ac2993c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8415","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8415/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8415/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8415/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/8415","id":221952421,"number":8415,"title":"Developing plugin in c++ sometimes make script mandatory, or require godot-code change","user":{"login":"CharlesWoodhill","id":13883399,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/13883399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesWoodhill","html_url":"https://github.com/CharlesWoodhill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesWoodhill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesWoodhill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesWoodhill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesWoodhill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesWoodhill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesWoodhill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesWoodhill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesWoodhill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesWoodhill/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-04-15T14:44:29Z","updated_at":"2017-04-25T09:03:45Z","closed_at":"2017-04-15T16:18:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device -
