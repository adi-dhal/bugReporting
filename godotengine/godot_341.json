makes BUTTON_WHEEL_UP/DOWN readable like any other mouse button\nusing `Input.is_mouse_button_pressed()` or `Input.is_action_pressed()`.\n\nIt simulates a delay between the \"mousewheel press\" event and the fake\n\"mousewheel release\" event.\n\n**I describe the intended behavior here, so it could be easily\nreimplemented for other platforms :**\n\nThe fake release event is scheduled to occurs 100ms after the press\nevent, which makes it catchable into any gdscript process function (as\nlong as the delta is smaller than 100ms indeed).\n\nWheelUp and WheelDown cancel each others by immediately triggering an\nearly release event if one was scheduled. Overlapping WheelUp and\nWheelDown is thus impossible.\n\nIf several \"WheelUp press\" (or several \"WheelDown press\") events occurs\nin less than 100ms, the matching release event is simply postponed to\noccur 100ms after the last \"wheel press\" event.\n\nThe states of the BUTTON_WHEEL_UP/DOWN are also accessible through\nInput.get_mouse_button_mask() respectively as bits 4 and 5.\n\n**What behavior does it change into the Editor ?**\n\nThe only change I have noticed is that when you mouse-wheel over the 2D\nor 3D viewports, it zooms in and out into two half steps instead of just\none. But this behavior was already happening before this patch. It's\njust that it was not noticeable because there was no delay between the\npress event and the fake release event.\n\n**TODO (by someone else) :**\n- reimplement it on Linux and MacOS\n- then, add `BUTTON_MASK_WHEEL_UP = 4` and `BUTTON_MASK_WHEEL_DOWN = 5`\n  into `input_event.h` and bind them into `globals_constants.cpp`.\n- replace the FAKE_MOUSEWHEEL_RELEASE_DELAY_IN_TICKS constant by a\n  project setting to allow to choose the fake release delay\n\nit fixes #1357 and #1636 for windows platform
