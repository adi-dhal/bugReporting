I used commits to save work and I'm not the most linear person in the world, so work is scattered and quite hard to group. I'll leave it like this for now though, since it might be easier to pinpoint specific changes if need be.~~ Nevermind, I rebased the history already,\r\n## Building\r\n- I'm using Visual Studio Community 2015 Update 3. May or may not work with earlier versions. Please report if you find that it works or not with other versions.\r\n- C++ tools for VS are needed of course, and also the Windows 10 SDK (all of which can be selected in the VS installer).\r\n- Clone the default `ms-master` branch from the [Microsoft ANGLE fork](https://github.com/Microsoft/angle) somewhere.\r\n- Set the `ANGLE_SRC_PATH` environment variable to the ANGLE clone full path.\r\n- Same instructions as [Windows](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/reference/compiling_for_windows.html): open the correct prompt (can also be the ARM prompt to build for devices). Run `scons p=winrt target=release_debug`.\r\n  - This will also build ANGLE for the correct architecture, so no need to pre-build it.\r\n### Templates\r\n\r\nThere's the `tools/dist/uwp_template` folder with the main template. Add the built `.exe` file here, rename it to `godot.winrt.exe` and Zip to a file called `winrt_%arch_%target`, where `%arch` is the architecture (`arm`, `x86` or `x64`) and `target` is either `release` or `debug`.\r\n\r\nThe template also need the built ANGLE DLLs. Copy `libEGL.dll` and `libGLESv2.dll` from `%ANGLE_SRC_PATH%\\winrt\\10\\src\\Release_%arch` (where `%arch` is `Win32`, `x64`, or `ARM`) to the root of the zip template.\r\n\r\nAs the other platforms, you need _all_ templates installed to be able to export. Those don't need to be correct, just to exist in the templates folder.\r\n\r\nNote that the emulator only runs the `x86` architecture.\r\n## Exporting\r\n\r\nThe exporter generate an **unsigned** `.appx` package. One important thing to change is the `Publisher` option in the export settings to match the certificate you'll use. Packages cannot be installed without being signed by a trusted certificate.\r\n### Signing\r\n\r\nThere's code for generating the signature but the digests don't match. It was ported from [fb-util-for-appx](https://github.com/facebook/fb-util-for-appx) and I failed to see what is the difference. I left the code because it's almost working and I'm willing to revisit it in the future.\r\n\r\nHence, signing can only be done in Windows for now (note you don't need to sign beforehand when submitting to the store). Instructions for [making a certificate](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/jj835832%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) and [signing a package](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/jj835835%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) are provided by Microsoft.\r\n### Bundles\r\n\r\nIt's theoretically possible to make \"App Bundles\". Those are similar to \"fat\" binaries, i.e. they contain packages for multiple architectures. There's no code for that now, but it should be easy to do by refactoring the packager code.\r\n## Third-party\r\n### ANGLE\r\n\r\n~~I added a module for [ANGLE](http://angleproject.org) since it's needed for UWP. Following the pattern already established in Godot to add the code and statically link instead of providing DLLs. Also, ANGLE may be used for Windows Desktop (which may solve some issues with problematic graphic cards) and maybe to EGL contexts like the Raspberry Pi.~~\r\n\r\nNo ANGLE module anymore. Now there's a dependency on external ANGLE source, as described in the \"Building\" section.\r\n### OpenSSL\r\n\r\nMicrosoft have their own [fork of OpenSSL](https://github.com/Microsoft/openssl) to make it work for WinRT. Luckily the changes I ported are quite minimal and to make it easier I provided a patch file to see what was changed and apply it to updates.\r\n\r\nFrom the MS fork I also took a file with shim code for unsupported API under UWP. This is only an _addition_ so it shouldn't cause problems.\r\n### Enet\r\n\r\nI also needed to apply a patch to make enet build. For this I did not store the patch file, but the changes were the same as [enet-uwp](https://github.com/ahrnbom/enet-uwp/commit/c14968f8f58cc96c5054e0c1a396701586582dbe). Those might even be pushed upstream, but AIUI enet is not really being maintained and not accepting PRs.\r\n## Missing features\r\n\r\nI don't see any important thing missing but I might have overlooked something. Nevertheless, here it's a list of things that wasn't ported because it's either too difficult or even impossible:\r\n- Window mode (resizable/borderless).\r\n- Maximizing/minimizing the window.\r\n- Monitor info (amount/size). This _might_ be possible with DirectX though.\r\n- <kbd>Alt</kbd> key and any combination is not reported. The <kbd>AltGr</kbd> is reported as <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>.\r\n- <kbd>F10</kbd> key is also not reported.

This is a very serious issue that can cause endless hard-to-spot bugs in games if not handled with utmost care.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nI am loading some data from json files. That data contains some integers that are used to reference an index in a normal array. \nIf done from a regular, gdscript dictionary, (such as `var mydict  = { value = 5 }` then I can do `print(myarray[mydict.value])` and as long as there's an index 5 in the array, that will work, no problem.\n\nThe problem comes if I acquire the same dictionary (with \"`value = 5`\") from json. Then it will fail. After spending some time debugging the issue, I came to the conclusion that the only way to get it to work is to \"cast\" the json-provided integer (like `print(myarray[int(mydict.value)])`). Meaning that, somehow, value doesn't contain an integer despite it having no decimal part in the json file.\n\n**Link to minimal example project** (optional but very welcome):\nDemonstration of this

So it may be fixed already, but I found only #5599 about this bug, and that one got already fixed in 2.1. So i decided to report it anyway.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\nMake a new scene. Add a TextureProgress node as root node or as a child of a CanvasLayer. Save.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6343","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6343/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6343/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/6343/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/6343","id":174257195,"number":6343,"title":"ItemList scrolling from GDScript - Impossible","user":{"login":"DimitriyPS","id":11189223,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11189223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimitriyPS","html_url":"https://github.com/DimitriyPS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimitriyPS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimitriyPS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimitriyPS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimitriyPS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimitriyPS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimitriyPS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimitriyPS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimitriyPS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimitriyPS/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279098082,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:gdscript","name":"topic:gdscript","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/6","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/6/labels","id":1807486,"number":6,"title":"2.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":263,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-06-03T16:13:32Z","updated_at":"2017-09-18T11:53:44Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2017-09-18T11:53:44Z"},"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-08-31T12:12:17Z","updated_at":"2016-09-11T20:12:19Z","closed_at":"2016-09-10T14:40:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**All OS / Godot 2.1**\n\nJudging from the discussion:\n[linc](https://godotengine.org/qa/7535/richtextlabel-itemlist-scrolling-from-gdscript)\n\nImpossible ItemList scrolling from GDScript.
