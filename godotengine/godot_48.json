It would be nice to add it directly in `main.cpp` and have it toggle a boolean, which you could then use in GDNative, instead of parsing command line arguments stealthily there (helps documentation to have all possible arguments defined in `main.cpp`).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10444","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10444/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10444/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10444/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10444","id":251425217,"number":10444,"title":"styleBoxFlat:

The changes have been\r\ntested on our WIP game, which uses godot-nim and depends on several\r\nthird-party .so libs, and Platformer demo to ensure nothing got broken.\r\n\r\n - .so libraries are exported to lib/ folder in .apk, instead of assets/,\r\n   because that's where Android expects them to be and it resolves the\r\n   library name into \"lib/<ABI>/<name>\", where <ABI> is the ABI matching\r\n   the current device. So we establish the convention that Android .so\r\n   files in the project must be located in the folder corresponding to\r\n   the ABI they were compiled for.\r\n\r\n - Godot callbacks (event handlers) are now called from the same thread\r\n   from which Main::iteration is called. It is also what Godot now\r\n   considers to be the main thread, because Main::setup is also called\r\n   from there. This makes threading on Android more consistent with\r\n   other platforms, making the code that depends on Thread::get_main_id\r\n   more portable (GDNative has such code).\r\n\r\n - Sizes of GDNative API types have been fixed to work on 32-bit\r\n   platforms.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10422/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":10,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10421","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10421/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10421/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10421/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/10421","id":251283516,"number":10421,"title":"ETC2 texture appears to be corrupt","user":{"login":"endragor","id":2417849,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2417849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/endragor","html_url":"https://github.com/endragor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/endragor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/endragor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/endragor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/endragor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/endragor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/endragor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/endragor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/endragor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/endragor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/4/labels","id":1449702,"number":4,"title":"3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":308,"closed_issues":2842,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T19:55:32Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-08-18T15:39:03Z","updated_at":"2017-09-04T21:45:59Z","closed_at":"2017-09-04T21:45:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Operating system or device -
