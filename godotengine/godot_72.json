scenes and even if the script had no changes. \r\nI set autosave to 10 seconds so the editor freezes every 10 seconds even if I don't have the Scripts tab open, making it pretty unusable in large scenes unless I close either the scene or the script file.\r\nThe test scene has 500 nodes which freeze up the editor for about 4 seconds in my PC, making it 1000 nodes freezes for 40 seconds.\r\nDisabling \"Auto Reload and Parse Scripts on Save\" in Editor Settings->Text Editor->Files stops the freezing.\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\n[Editor
