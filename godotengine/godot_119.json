people were confused about the name \"DLScript\".\r\nDLScript stands for \"dynamic linking script\". It's a module used for using shared libraries as scripts.\r\n\r\nThe confusion stems from the fact that a \"script\" is usually a computer program *written in a scripting language*. Since DLScript deals with binary files (shared libraries) there are no direct scripting languages in use.\r\n\r\nThis name was chosen in the first place because game logic in Godot is accessed via the *scripting system* and all this module does is *dynamically link in* native code.\r\nAlso you're adding a *\"script\"* to a node, so it made sense to us to include \"Script\" in the module name.\r\n\r\nThose are implementation details which not every user of Godot is aware of.\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nNow I'm asking for pros and cons of a rename and what name you think is better suited.\r\nPlease only make suggestions if you know remotely how this module works, what it does and *what it is not*. The [blog post](https://godotengine.org/article/dlscript-here) and the [FAQ](https://github.com/GodotNativeTools/godot_headers/blob/master/README.md) should give you a good insight to be able to constructively join the discussion.\r\n\r\nSome suggestions that were made this far:\r\n * Godot/Native (or GDNative)\r\n * DLBridge\r\n * NativeBridge or NativeLink / DLBridge or DLLink","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8311","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8311/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8311/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8311/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8311","id":220358153,"number":8311,"title":"Spaces to tabs and layout adjustments on .mm files","user":{"login":"BastiaanOlij","id":1945449,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1945449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij","html_url":"https://github.com/BastiaanOlij","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BastiaanOlij/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-04-07T23:50:37Z","updated_at":"2017-04-09T11:31:26Z","closed_at":"2017-04-08T14:49:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/8311","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8311","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8311.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/8311.patch"},"body":"Applied a bunch of layout changes to .mm files to bring them in line with the clang reformatting we've done for C++ files.

OS_Unix::execute() now depends on forkfd, which is used instead of fork() if the condition `!p_blocking` is met.\r\n- `OS_Unix::execute()` calls forkfd_nofd() instead of forkfd(). Unlike the latter, forkfd_nofd() does not create any file descriptor to track the child process. This allows forkfd to be used by `OS_Unix::execute()` without gdb notifying (unless a startup command is specified) of SIGPIPE signals, since `OS_Unix::execute()` would immediately close the returned file descriptor otherwise.\r\n\r\nTested on the following platforms:\r\n\r\n- [x] x11 (Ubuntu 16.04 64bit)\r\n- [ ] server\r\n- [x] windows (Windows 7 64bit)\r\n- [ ] osx\r\n- [ ] iphone\r\n- [ ] android\r\n- [ ] haiku\r\n- [ ] bb10\r\n- [ ] uwp\r\n\r\nI can't test on the unchecked platforms, I don't have access to them (well, android, but...).\r\n\r\nExample: https://gist.github.com/neikeq/5b3ab0461733d1100561b0ba227a19e0\r\n\r\nDocs will come later.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8310/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8309","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8309/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8309/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8309/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/8309","id":220318238,"number":8309,"title":"Bug: HScrollbar slider cannot be grabbed when at leftmost side.","user":{"login":"Zach777","id":27028216,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/27028216?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zach777","html_url":"https://github.com/Zach777","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zach777/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zach777/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zach777/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zach777/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zach777/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zach777/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zach777/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zach777/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zach777/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-04-07T20:20:32Z","updated_at":"2017-04-17T14:54:57Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"**Godot 2.1.2 Stable for Linux**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Issue description:\r\n When the slider of the scrollbar is at the far left side, which\r\nis the min value, I cannot grab the slider with the mouse.\r\n    I insured that no other control node or selectable node was\r\nobstructing selection of the slider.\r\n    The slider is still highlighted when the mouse hovers\r\nover the bar but the moment the mouse pointer is within\r\nrange of grabbing the slider the slider stops being highlighted.\r\n    The issue caused by the bug is alleviated by setting the\r\nsliders page value to a higher setting.

It would be cool to have at least all methods that are [exposed to varcall](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_image.html) implemented here. (if you want to go further and include functions only available to C++ then that's cool as well).~~\r\n\r\n[godot_string](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/modules/gdnative/godot/godot_string.h): Basically only has a constructor, a way to get the data back out of it, equality and concatenation. The [C++ class](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/core/ustring.h) has a lot more functions that are also very important, (like `String::num()`). Also a function to get a `char *` would be nice, using `wchar_t *` can be a pain.\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\n~~Other types have missing C functions as well, but those functions can be implemented in the language binding much easier than string and image.~~\r\n\r\n * ~~[godot_vector3](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/modules/dlscript/godot/godot_vector3.h)~~\r\n * ~~[godot_vector2](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/modules/dlscript/godot/godot_vector2.h)~~\r\n * ~~[godot_transform2d](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/modules/dlscript/godot/godot_transform2d.h)~~\r\n\r\n~~Maybe there are more, but these are the ones I can think of right now. Probably all of the C wrapped core types lack functionality. Feel free to wrap the C++ classes as much as possible.~~\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\n~~Also, there's no equivalent of GDScript's `print()` or C++'s `print_line()`. So currently it's not possible to write to the in-editor-console using DLScript. A `godot_print()` function that does that would be cool. Such a function would live in [`godot.h/.c`](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/modules/dlscript/godot.h)~~\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\n\r\n# Update\r\n\r\nonly really `string` methods are missing.\r\nThe rest is more or less complete, mostly thanks to @touilleMan  and also @sheepandshepherd.\r\n\r\nAlso @cynicaldevil for the efforts of wrapping Image, but that was removed recently, so your changes are obsolete 🙁 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there are any questions, message me on IRC or Discord","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8300/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":1}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8299","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8299/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8299/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/8299/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/8299","id":220057484,"number":8299,"title":"Full screen shaders does not work in browser (texscreen issue?)","user":{"login":"DjPale","id":1427902,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1427902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DjPale","html_url":"https://github.com/DjPale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DjPale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DjPale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DjPale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DjPale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DjPale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DjPale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DjPale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DjPale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DjPale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279128044,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/confirmed","name":"confirmed","color":"66dd66","default":false},{"id":279098111,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:rendering","name":"topic:rendering","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/milestones/5/labels","id":1449703,"number":5,"title":"2.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"akien-mga","id":4701338,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4701338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga","html_url":"https://github.com/akien-mga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akien-mga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":119,"closed_issues":1250,"state":"open","created_at":"2015-12-08T11:42:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T10:14:01Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":8,"created_at":"2017-04-06T22:56:04Z","updated_at":"2017-04-28T16:39:29Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"**Operating system or device - Godot version:**\r\nWindows 10 Pro x64 v1607\r\nChrome Version 57.0.2987.133\r\nGodot v2.1.2-stable (Steam)\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nFull-screen shaders doesn't work on Chrome, might be an issue with texscreen as I discovered this while making my own screen-space shading with some lighting effects\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nExport the demo \"Screen-Space Shaders to the HTML target\", host it and run in Chrome.
