understand what they do and why.So since every developer who makes it`s project open source wants to build a community around the project many people would want to add new features to that project.But

When moving to another frame (or playing) then moving back to the first frame, the mesh is suddenly distorted and cannot be restored until the scene is reloaded.\n### Steps to reproduce:\n- In Blender, pose the armature in a transformed state (move it around etc).\n- Export it using the \"Better collada exporter\"\n- Import in Godot using Import->\"3D Scene\"\n- Open the scene's Animation player in Godot.\n- Push play or just move to another frame.\n  - Notice the distortion\n- Move back to frame 0 and it still remains etc.\n- You can now repopen the scene and the distortion will be gone.\n\nThis is after first importing the mesh.\n\n![showing_ok_mesh_first_frame](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8754559/5971677/361dd2c0-a808-11e4-9e14-088b0e34d0a6.png)\n\nAfter moving away from frame 0 in the animation player (by playing etc). Moving back to frame zero retains distortion, as seen here:\n\n![messed_up_first_frame](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8754559/5971661/d36dc874-a807-11e4-92c7-bebe08b2d4b3.png)\n\nIf you reopen the scene it will look normal again, until you animate.  The same behavior is seen if you animate in code, by referencing any animation name (even if they just contain the rest pose).\n### Workaround\n\nThe issue appears to be when exporting if you leave the armature in a transformed state (not in the rest identity transform, pose).  As seen here:\n\n![default_pose_blender](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8754559/5971694/79758b44-a808-11e4-81cb-e1174d008b20.png)\n\nThe solution is to clear all rotations, scale and translations in pose mode before exporting.  Additionally I made a \"default\" animation strip as the first animation and have 1 frame with just the rest pose.\n\nShown here:\n\n![rest_pose](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8754559/5971714/ea9254b0-a808-11e4-84d5-d20c6ff899da.png)\n\nThe project is here: \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0By6FH_3O43IRWnBtWWhUYXhuQVU/view?usp=sharing\n- The blender file located under RawAssets->3d_santa.blend\n- The Collada file is under RawAssets->3d_santa.dae\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1315","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1315/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1315/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1315/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/1315","id":55997033,"number":1315,"title":"Allow arrays in shaders","user":{"login":"seadra","id":9574367,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/9574367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra","html_url":"https://github.com/seadra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seadra/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":279096997,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/archived","name":"archived","color":"888888","default":false},{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":279098111,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:rendering","name":"topic:rendering","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2015-01-30T05:43:11Z","updated_at":"2016-04-01T09:28:12Z","closed_at":"2016-04-01T09:28:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Not sure if this even needs a justification, but here is why I just needed them.\nThere is a huge class of shaders that use lookup tables, in the form of arrays.\n\nOrdered dithering, color quantization, noise, many others to count...\nSeriously, no arrays? :D\n\nAnd it shouldn't be difficult to implement, right?

It could use some more functions like:\n- creating straight from Polygon2D\n- creating from TileMap\n- creating from objects array (using their shapes or sprites f.e.)\n- using shapes to calculate routes\n- path offset\n\nAt the moment it is only useful when creating route through static, pre-defined environment; while assuming that object moving through this path is of point size (or smaller), unless the path was offseted manually.\n\nCreating any dynamic pathfind usually ends up with strange routes because of badly interpreted connections ( there can't be more than 1 line going through 1 point? ) or overlapping polygons.\n\nI'd say current [polygon_path_finder_demo](https://github.com/okamstudio/godot/tree/master/demos/2d/polygon_path_finder_demo) is the best example of current PolygonPathFinder capabilities :(\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1308/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1307","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1307/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1307/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1307/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/1307","id":55599474,"number":1307,"title":"Adjustment to x11/detect.py","user":{"login":"sambler","id":149608,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/149608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sambler","html_url":"https://github.com/sambler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sambler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sambler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sambler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sambler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sambler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sambler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sambler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sambler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sambler/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-01-27T10:21:13Z","updated_at":"2015-02-10T00:18:25Z","closed_at":"2015-02-10T00:18:25Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/1307","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/1307","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/1307.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/1307.patch"},"body":"Test if clang is defined in CC/CXX/LD - this allows a specific version of clang to be defined, which may be a full path or have a version suffix.\nMove appending -DTYPED_METHOD_BIND to keep clang options together\n\nMove sanitize option out of use_llvm test, gcc48+ also supports sanitize=address\nNot sure with env.extra_suffix after sanitize, would this way leave a trailing 's' not in a location desired?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1307/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1306","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1306/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1306/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/1306/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/1306","id":55592827,"number":1306,"title":"fix build on freebsd","user":{"login":"sambler","id":149608,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/149608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sambler","html_url":"https://github.com/sambler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sambler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sambler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sambler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sambler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sambler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sambler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sambler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sambler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sambler/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-01-27T09:13:20Z","updated_at":"2015-02-10T00:20:22Z","closed_at":"2015-02-10T00:20:22Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/1306","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/1306","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/1306.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/1306.patch"},"body":"I have got godot to build and run on FreeBSD.
