(2.1.3 and 2.1.4)\r\n- Randomly, when selecting a node or making a connection, several other nodes will be selected. (2.1.3 and 2.1.4)\r\n- Sometimes, you cannot deselect a node. (2.1.4, haven't replicated on 2.1.3)\r\n- When panning, if a node is selected, the node moves as well. (2.1.4)\r\n- After deleting a node, several random nodes are selected. When the mouse moves all of the selected nodes are repositioned on top of each-other. (2.1.3 and 2.1.4)\r\n- Node positions are hidpi dependent. Meaning, if I organize my graph on a retina display, then open godot on a normal display, the nodes are 2x further apart from each-other.

The icons generation time is increased, as i suspected, the color replacement takes some time, so according to my measurements, the icon generation time for the white theme is 0.37 s whereas for the dark theme is 0.26 s, i know it is not much of a increase but this time is added to the editor and project manager boot time, (it should be less with release mode), (also there is room for optimization in color replacement).\r\n\r\n2. visual issues: the ones i found so far\r\n![screenshot from 2017-09-04 13-05-07](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1103897/30035756-04132ee0-9173-11e7-85fa-965a6e193be9.png)\r\n![screenshot from 2017-09-04 13-05-35](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1103897/30035762-07c4c7c4-9173-11e7-97df-0a56fa9ada3a.png)\r\n![screenshot from 2017-09-04 13-05-55](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1103897/30035764-09968d58-9173-11e7-836f-167d7a27505f.png)\r\n\r\n3. this is not related with white theme, but it is a change introduced by it\r\ncontrast_colorx for variable naming is not very good, the thing is that there are just to variant for contrast\r\ndark and light, thats way more explicit than, since usually you dont choose full black or **full white** as base color\r\n\r\n4. white as a base color might no be a good idea.\r\nwhite should not be used as base theme,  because you are loosing the light contrast variation, instead a more greyish color should be used (people can still set that as a base color, but with poor results).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconcerns (should be a little harder to solve):\r\nMy main concern about supporting the white theme, is that now we have to focus in making sure that everything we do works on light and dark themes (this is hard), there are several hardcoded colors, and several style rules, also element that were designed for a dark theme do not match exaclty when presented on dark themes (and vice-versa), increased effort in new visual features, now we have to test on both variations (something that apparently has not been done so far). @toger5 i know you use the light theme, and when you do changes you focus mostly on the white theme, and i do stuff for the dark theme (which is the official flavor). so @toger5 we have to figure out a way to avoid throwing dirt on each other (meaning when you fix something for light, it breaks something for dark and vice-versa). also first and foremost we have to focus our efforts in the official flavor (which is dark).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\n<!-- Optional but very welcome.

am trying to write an addon that lets the user open an image file from the spritesheet editor with an external app - directly from godot.\r\n\r\nto do that I have to get the name of the currently selected animation in the spritesheet editor, and also get the currently selected frame.\r\n\r\n`get_selection().get_selected_nodes()[0].get_animation()) `\r\nwill always return the first animation, or whatever is set in the inspector, and not what I need - what the user has selected in the sprite sheet editor\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no way to access that information from the spritesheet editor via gdscript.\r\n\r\nIs this possible to do at all, or is it a missing feature?\r\n\r\nMy end goal is to make an addon that lets godot create new image files and open them in any external editor - with a single command - as well as open existing images in sprites, spritesheets and any node that has them as a resource\r\n\r\nI tried writing a pixel art tool addon, but abandoned it for now , since I got stuck at the eraser tool -godot is missing a blending mode that would allow me to implement an eraser tool in a clean way.\r\nhttps://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/10255\r\n\r\nSo I decided to make an addon that would at least let me create and open images in an external editor by calling it from within godot - I want to make a way to have better integration of external tools with the resources within godot that are assigned to nodes -mainly png and other type of images.\r\nI want to reduce the number of clicks required to get to them in an editing app to one or two","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/10960/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4963","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507238052","x-github-request-id":"A54E:572D:1327461:2E8F96F:59D69A12","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/15634981/issues?state=all&page=31>;
