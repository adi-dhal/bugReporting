system or device - Godot version:**\r\nOn Android, probably also on other platforms when res:// is pointing to a read/only directory\r\nGodot 2.1.3 stable\r\n\r\nThe error might not occur if Android is rooted.\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nI want to change a value in the engine.cfg from GDScript.\r\n\"Globals\" allows this, but on save it files with error 12 (ERR_FILE_CANT_OPEN). This is because it tries to write the config to its initial position in res:// which is read-only on many platforms.\r\n\r\nSaving to another location is possible via Globals.save_customs() but the game/app won't read it on startup. So that is useless AFAIK.\r\n\r\nI've seen in the source that godot also tries to read/merge a override.cfg on startup, but also... only from res:// or the current directory. A solution for this problem would be when godot searches for an override.cfg (or whatever) in user:// because that is the directory where files are allowed to be written (usually).\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nvar res= Globals.save()\r\nprint(\"Globals save, result: \"+String(res))\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9194/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9193","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9193/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9193/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9193/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/9193","id":236141913,"number":9193,"title":"stencil
