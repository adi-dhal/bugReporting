And it can be seen that the \"Collision Pairs\", in Physics3d, in the monitor of the debugger, are lower than normal.\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\nhttps://github.com/Mbenoni1/GodotEngineTestProject\r\n\r\nThis is a minimalist version of my own project. To see the problem happens, just launch, click play, then move with the arrows of your keyboard to take some elements. It will after a short time automatically come back to menu. Click \"play\", etc, and see the bug happens after 2 to 4 cycle.\r\n\r\nThanks !

was looking for a Finite State Machine implementation for my game, but found only limited implementations working as plugins.\r\nAs FSM are a commonly used tool to define objects behavious in video games, I was wondering why not implement it as a built-in feature for godot.\r\n\r\nThus, I open this issue to discuss multiple thing: \r\n- Should it be implemented as a built-in function ?\r\n- If the answer is yes, how ?\r\n\r\nHere is my idea of a possible implementation:\r\n- A FSM parent node is responsible for the state machine handling, while its children are the states.\r\n- Hierachical FSM can be implemented by using a FSM a a child of another FSM.\r\n- The initial state is the first child node (or predefined maybe).\r\n- A transition between two nodes can be added using a function of the FSM node:\r\n`add_transition(NodePath from, NodePath to, FuncRef[] conditions, FuncRef[] inverted_conditions, int priority=0)`\r\nWhen the current state is the \"from\" node (or one of its children), the transition can be trigerred if all functions called in `conditions` return **true** and all functions called in `inverted_conditions` return **false**. The current state node is then set to `to`. Transitions with higher priorities are treated first.\r\n- An \"update\" function in the FSM node triggers transitions util none can be triggered (up to a fixed limit of transitions, so that it does not goes in circles until infinity).\r\n- State nodes can implement three functions that are automatically called when the FSM update is triggered: \r\n  - `on_state_enter` is trigerred when the node becomes the current state\r\n  - `on_state_exit` is trigerred when the node is no more the current state\r\n  - `on_state_update` is triggered once per `update` FSM call, once we have found the new state.\r\n\r\nThis implementation could be completed with a specific editor view, with something like that:\r\n![FSM](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/images/state-flowchart.png)\r\n\r\nWhat do you think

The smaller the value, the smaller the roll the car body experiences in turns. 0.1 is still the default value, but you can now set a larger value (for even greater roll) or smaller (for roll that is only cosmetic and doesn't threaten rollover).\r\n    This is especially important if someone wants different kinds of cars that behave differently wrt roll (e.g. a pickup truck vs a minicar vs a sports car)\r\n\r\nP.S.

all methods of the Godot API are lower case, e.g. `set_position()`.
