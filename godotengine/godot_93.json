system or device - Godot version:** \r\n2.1.3 Stable (64-bit)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Issue description:**\r\nThe Rigidbody2D node does not appear to have correctly functioning Continuous Collision Detection (even thought the option is present).  \"Tunneling\" occurs with both \"Cast Ray\" and \"Cast Shape\" options.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n1. Create a Rigidbody2D node and enable Continuous CD in it's properties (Cast Ray or Cast Shape).\r\n2. Create an Area2D node as a child of the Rigidbody2D node (so it has mass). \r\n3. Place the Rigidbody2D node overtop of a ColliderObject2D node (make it static because it should never move anyway).\r\n4. Set gravity scale to something large, like ... I dunno... 300 or something.\r\n5. Run the game, watch your Rigidbody2D either pass through the static collider or tunnel into it slightly.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have tried both options (Cast Ray and Cast Shape) and neither of them seem to work.  Looking back on previous issues posted here (and elsewhere), it appears Continuous CD was broken since version 2 of Godot was released and never got fixed.  Is there any chance this can be corrected soon?  It impacts a lot of my testing currently.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9071/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9070","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9070/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9070/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/9070/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9070","id":233944492,"number":9070,"title":"Fix
