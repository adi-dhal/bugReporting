Check this screenshot please: http://itmages.com/image/view/1638064/11bfe00e\n\nSo. \nEither Help page need use all color setting from script editor (Help page need to use script editor's background color), or Help page need use always default colors. \nElse Help page become to be unreadable if you prefer to use light background in script editor. \n\nI understand that you have really much important problems but this issue do work with Godot for people with eye problems (like me) really hard. \nIt is not urgently.
