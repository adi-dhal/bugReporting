I later posted about the z-buffer issue I mention in greater detail [as a separate thread](http://www.godotengine.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=560) with a minimal reproduction (as it's a general problem that doesn't have to do with 3D scene imports).\n\nThe Blender scene that I made to test this feature (as mentioned below), can be downloaded here: http://cheesekeg.com/listings/rocks_and_water.zip\n\nTo kick off my experimenting with Godot, I made a small 3D scene using Blender 2.7a containing the following objects:\n- A sky-sphere (unshaded sphere mesh with a texture)\n- A plane for water (reflective, slightly transparent plane with high specularity, a wavy normal map, and a noise texture)\n- A mesh for rocks (with a normal map and texture)\n- A hemi-lamp (a directional light; energy of 3 with a slight yellow tint)\n- And, of course, a camera\n\nEverything is generated from within Blender (including textures/normal maps).\n\nHere's what it looks like rendered in Blender:\n![Screenshot of Blender scene rendering](http://i.imgur.com/mZ7u9dN.png)\n\nFirstly, I tried to export as-is (no export config changes) using the \"Khronos Collada\" exporter found [within the repository](https://github.com/okamstudio/godot/tree/master/tools/export/blender25):\n![Screenshot of Khronos Collada export](http://i.imgur.com/NOKaBa4.png)\n\nImmediately, I ran into this incompatibility issue with the hemi-lamp:\n![Screenshot of incompatibility issue](http://i.imgur.com/LeRDYZY.png)\n\nSo I unchecked \"Lamp\" in the exporter's settings:\n![Screenshot of Khronos Collada export settings](http://i.imgur.com/QYMJZhL.png)\n...and the DAE export succeeded, so I imported it with Godot and added a \"Direction Light\" to start (since I couldn't export the hemi-lamp):\n![Screenshot of 3D scene imported with Godot](http://i.imgur.com/9iongZ1.png)\n\nAfter correcting the camera's FOV, here's what it looks like in the editor:\n![Screenshot of 3D scene from the camera's perspective in Godot](http://i.imgur.com/e8KgeqH.png)\n\n...and here's what it looks like in-game:\n![Screenshot of 3D scene in-game with Godot](http://i.imgur.com/oafdwgf.png)\n\nAs you can see, I'm running into a few problems here:\n- **The rock mesh is drawing over the water completely! (z-buffer issues?)** Also, in the editor, the opposite is happening (the water is drawing over the rock mesh completely!)\n- None of the textures/normal maps carried over\n\nThere are probably a few more things that I could list, but most other issues are easily fixable by readjusting the settings for each object anyhow.\n\nI zipped the blend file and tossed it up here: http://cheesekeg.com/listings/rocks_and_water.zip\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/380/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/379","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/379/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/379/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/379/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/379","id":32977279,"number":379,"title":"call
