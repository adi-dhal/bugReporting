port a project from 2.1 to 3 and I realized that the generic 6DOF joint isn't working, everything gets unstable, so I started tracking down the regression.\r\nIn this branch (https://github.com/m4nu3lf/godot/tree/bugfix/physics) it was working, so by rebuilding tons of different commits I've been able to find where things broke, and it is... just after the merge of the branch (https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/7426)!\r\nDiffing the physics server I couldn't see any major change before and after the merge so... long story short, the bug is in the Matrix3 and/or Transform classes. Not sure if the conventions have been changed without updating the physics engine, but if I revert just those 2 files to before the merge (fixing just a few compilation errors) everything works again\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nCreate 2 rigid bodies and join them with a Generic6DOFJoint with angular

description:**\r\nIt seems as if the mouse position as reported by get_global_mouse_position() is incorrect when in tool mode.

When running in game mode the mouse position is correct.\r\nIt seems to be related to the position of the game viewport, if you increase the width of the sidebar, the mouse offset also increases.\r\n\r\nThis is with the Godot_v3.0-alpha1_win64 build. 2.x does not seem to have the same issue.\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\n```python\r\ntool\r\n\r\nextends
