is a small modification but may enable many possibilities. One of the possibilities is to create a plugin for a plugin and so on... e.g. Can create a plugin to handle an object of type Polygon2D.\n\nOne of main modification was the creation of the class `EditorPluginList`:\n\n``` c++\nclass EditorPluginList : public Object{\n\n    private:\n        Vector<EditorPlugin*> plugins_list;\n\n    public:\n        void set_plugins_list(Vector<EditorPlugin*> p_plugins_list){ plugins_list = p_plugins_list; }\n        Vector<EditorPlugin*> get_plugins_list(){ return plugins_list; }\n\n        void make_visible(bool p_visible);\n        void edit(Object *p_object);\n        bool forward_input_event(const InputEvent& p_event);\n        bool forward_spatial_input_event(Camera* p_camera,const InputEvent& p_event);\n        void clear();\n        bool empty();\n\n        EditorPluginList();\n        ~EditorPluginList();\n\n}; \n```\n\nThis is nothing more than the information holder of current editors enabled. This is a wraper for actions to be executed simultaneously at all being edited plugins.\n\nNow, instead of having one single top_editor_plugin, you can have multiple that will `handle()` the same Object type.\n\nAll the plugins that can handle the current selected editor object/resource is added to the list of editor plugins.\n\nI already noticed that may be an inconsistency when were talking about event forwarding, because what I have implemented is: \"When some plugin of the being edited list decide to discard the event, so ... DISCARD the event. \".\n\nWith this in mind, we can easily add a flag to define which plugins of the list have the priority to discard the events.\n\nWell, it is my first contribution on third part github project, so I'm very excited whit that. I may be doing something wrong, but please correct me if I'm wrong. \n\nHope it is cool for you, as it was for me.

seek-to-zero, and I believe the other two are bugs.\n\nIn OneShot, it was used to reset the oneshot animation to the beginning\nwhen fired. But this would fail if the oneshot node was fired before it\nhad completed its previous run. While this _could_ be a valid way for\noneshot to work (firing does nothing if it's already running), the code\ncurrently resets the fade-in, so I believe that it is intended to reset.\nI replaced this usage with seek-to-0.\n\nIn Transition, it was used on the previous (fading out) animation when\nseeking the Transition node, which I believe is incorrect: why would you\nwant to loop a non-looping animation instead of simply fading out from\nthe end? Also it will never happen unless you seek the Transition node\ntwice during one cross-fade.\n\nThe other two uses are in Transition and _process_animation, where it is\nused along with a seek-to-zero which overrides it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4154","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4154/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4154/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/4154/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/4154","id":143797665,"number":4154,"title":"add
