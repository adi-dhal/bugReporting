related and one lead to me finding the other. I've noticed this problem (get_frustum errors) with 2.x before, but the editor crash was a new one in 3.0\r\n\r\nI'll try and explain it as best I can.\r\n\r\nBasically, the problem happens when you set the world parameter on a viewport (which has a child camera), clear it, save and then close the scene.\r\n\r\nWhen the scene is re-opened, everything will appear fine, but if you then create a new blank scene or open up any other scene, you'll get the following error every time the editor camera updates:\r\n\r\nscene/3d/camera.cpp:601 - Condition ' !is_inside_world() ' is true. Returned: Vector<Plane>()\r\n\r\nThis was annoying as it slowed down the editor a bit, but it didn't usually stop me working. Unfortunately that changed when I found that if you try to play a spatial sound by clicking the 'playing' checkbox on an AudioStreamPlayer3D the editor will crash. I suspect this is because the 3D audio relies on the camera position and whatever's causing the previous error has probably caused a null reference to something \r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n\r\n- Load the project I've attached\r\n- Select the viewport node and then clear the world it currently has set (You might start seeing 'scene/resources/world.cpp:125 - ' Condition !E ' is true.' errors)\r\n- Save the scene and close it\r\n- Load the scene\r\n- create a new blank scene and move the camera around, you should see lots of this error: \r\nscene/3d/camera.cpp:601 - Condition ' !is_inside_world() ' is true. Returned: Vector<Plane>()\r\n\r\nThe issue with audio is that spatial play back in a scene where this error is happening will cause godot to crash\r\n\r\n\r\n**Link to minimal example project:**\r\n[viewport_bug.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/1327398/viewport_bug.zip)\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional but very welcome.
