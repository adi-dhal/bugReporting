example you have raycast object with ray to 0,-1,0 when you put it under a box shape it will detect a the collision but it will not detect a collision if you put it under a capsule shape(unless you put the raycast completely into the object or the ray to is (0,1,0) there is a project that you can download and see:\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/download/8m503pg60zd3f2j/Fps.zip\nIn here the player won't fall because the gravity scale is 0.\nYou will see that the raycast 1 will detect collision with the T but the raycast 2 will not detect any collision with Player.

is feature request, and follows from the discussion in the issue #3223.\n\nIn GDScript, currently, there is no way to wait/block until a signal completes (in a general setting). This is in particular desirable in situations where the user wants to keep the game logic is synchronous, and the code structure flat (rather than sorting to a callback/futures/promises style game logic, which can be harder to develop and maintain).\n\nIt can be realized by adding a blocking alternative of signal-yield which blocks/waits until the signal is handled completely, or adding a `blocking=false` parameter to signal variant of yield for example.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3235/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3234","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3234/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3234/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3234/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/3234","id":124811913,"number":3234,"title":"Allow

I hope it's OK to make an issue about this.\n\nIn the [documentation](http://www.godotengine.org/projects/godot-engine/wiki/GDScript#Coroutines-38-Signals), it says:\n\n> The real strength of using yield is when combined with signals. yield can accept two parameters, an object and a signal. When the signal is activated, execution will return.\n\nBut this works only if you call yield in a \"top-level\" function in the GDScript call stack. For example, if I use yield as follows, it doesn't block:\n\n```\n# script of the class\n\nvar m_param\n\n# return a result from a signal\nfunc get_result():\n    # stuff...\n    yield(node, \"signal\")\n    # more stuff here...\n    return m_param\n\nfunc signal_callback(param):\n    m_param = param\n```\n\nWhen I make an instance of this class and call get_result as follows:\n\n```\n# stuff\nvar result = obj.get_result()\n```\n\nit gives me a `GDFunctionState`, not `m_param`.\n\nThis is useful for getting input from the user via an input from a GUI control object for example.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug in the implementation or the intended behavior but it's a bit confusing. Maybe the docs should be updated to clarify that yield doesn't actually block.\n\nThat being said, a blocking alternative to yield is sorely need for the use case I mentioned above.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3223/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3222","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3222/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3222/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3222/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/3222","id":124685399,"number":3222,"title":"Add \"Make Resource Unique\" flag (allow unique Materials on instanced nodes)","user":{"login":"FEDE0D","id":6296184,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6296184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FEDE0D","html_url":"https://github.com/FEDE0D","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FEDE0D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FEDE0D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FEDE0D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FEDE0D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FEDE0D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FEDE0D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FEDE0D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FEDE0D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FEDE0D/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330068,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/feature%20proposal","name":"feature proposal","color":"1144ff","default":false},{"id":279097966,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:core","name":"topic:core","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":279098111,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:rendering","name":"topic:rendering","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":283518733,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"007700","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2016-01-04T01:59:25Z","updated_at":"2017-09-18T09:51:47Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"_bugsquad edit:  The orginal title of this issue was \"Shader material not unique on instanced nodes\"_\n_Changed title to reflect \"feature proposal\" status in reaction to reduz comment: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/3222#issuecomment-168666945_\n\n---\n\nRelated to #2162\n\nWhen using shader on sprites (haven tested on other nodes), the shader is the same for every instanced sprite.\nI have a setup where the sprites are instanced in the editor inside another scene. If the shader changes one of it's parameters it changes on every sprite instance.\n\nRootNode\n===> Instanced1\n=====> Sprite(shader)\n===> Instanced2\n======> Sprite(shader)\n\nThis happens even if I use the \"Make sub-resources unique\" on the instanced node. The only way to achive this is going node by node and set the \"Editable Children\" flag to true. Then navigating to the sprite child node and setting \"Make sub-resources unique\" flag.\n\nIs there a reason why the shader resources are not duplicated when duplicating nodes that are using them?\n\nPS: here's a test project
