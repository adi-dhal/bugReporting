system or device - Godot version:**\nMageia 6 x64, git master HEAD\n\n**Issue description** (what happened, and what was expected):\nLoading a tileset source TSCN and saving it, and/or exporting/saving again an existing TRES tileset resource generates random redistribution of the subresources' IDs, leading to unnecessary diffs.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n1. Download the attached minimal example, which is a zipped git repo (so that changes can be seen with `git diff`)\n2. Load `mountain_tileset.tscn` in the editor, export the TileSet to overwrite `mountain_tileset.tres` (make sure to untick \"Merge with existing\").\n3. Check the `git diff`: it might show some random reordering of the subresources in `mountain_tileset.tres`. If it doesn't, close the editor, and repeat step 2 and 3. It might take several attempts to happen.\n4. Once you have a diff, `git add .` the changes to take it as the new \"reference\" (in case the previous state was actually bad).\n5. Repeat steps 2 and 3; depending on your luck, you might see the previous changes being reverted again. Saving `TileMap.tscn` might also exhibit the issue, as it resaves the TRES resource.\n\nThe behaviour is a bit non-deterministic, it kind of looks like the order of the subresources depends on the time, or the way the resources were loaded into memory in the editor, etc.\n\nAt any rate, some way should be found to ensure that such resources won't get randomly reordered, and ideally they should be sorted by ascending IDs.\n\nExample diff:\n\n``` diff\ndiff --git a/mountain_tileset.tres b/mountain_tileset.tres\nindex 0a6adab..7ded8df 100644\n--- a/mountain_tileset.tres\n+++

Happens only for mouse button 4 and 5, normal mouse button presses 1 to 3 are not received by the parent control.\n\n**Link to minimal example project**:\n[ui.tar.gz](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/380220/ui.tar.gz)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5888/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5887","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5887/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5887/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/5887/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/5887","id":167225322,"number":5887,"title":"Having more general information icons for the scene panel.","user":{"login":"Sslaxx","id":324679,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/324679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sslaxx","html_url":"https://github.com/Sslaxx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sslaxx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sslaxx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sslaxx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sslaxx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sslaxx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sslaxx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sslaxx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sslaxx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sslaxx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330066,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"44bbff","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false},{"id":283518733,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"007700","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-07-24T09:30:23Z","updated_at":"2017-08-08T11:57:34Z","closed_at":"2017-08-08T11:57:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67740160/Scene_Panel.png - the popup node has a warning icon next to it.
