Next frames draws according autoplay animation. I think it is bad behavior.\r\n\r\nFor example i want my scene to smooth alpha intro. If i leave animation editor somewhere in the middle, new instances will flicker a frame. To fix this i will put time marker right to the start (where alpha is 0). It is uncomfortable to do: i must do this with every autoplay animation. But when i want to edit scene i will make it visible by dragging time marker, and then pop it to start when i'm done.\r\n\r\nI think autoplay animation will start and draw the first frame as it in
