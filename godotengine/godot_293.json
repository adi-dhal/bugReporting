using sliders (HSlider and VSlider. And applies to SpinBox as well.), I noticed two small quirks that could be subject to discussion. Specifically in the case of using integers/ \"Rounded values\".\n\nThe second thing is that the limits for the sliders seem reasonable for floats, but 65535 seems like a very low number for integers. While multiplication tricks could be used to get around this limit, it could become cumbersome when the numbers could get large like money or experience points. Seems the only way to get exact integers over 65535 is using a LineEdit, but that'd require accounting for possible non-numeric characters the user may accidentally input.\n\nIs there something that could be done for this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3091/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3090","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3090/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3090/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3090/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3090","id":122383755,"number":3090,"title":"Fix Remove Item option in TileSet plugin","user":{"login":"neikeq","id":7718100,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7718100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neikeq","html_url":"https://github.com/neikeq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neikeq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neikeq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neikeq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neikeq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neikeq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neikeq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neikeq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neikeq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neikeq/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":73330064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ff2222","default":true},{"id":279098219,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/labels/topic:editor","name":"topic:editor","color":"ffdd44","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-12-15T22:39:35Z","updated_at":"2016-02-17T20:14:14Z","closed_at":"2015-12-16T09:18:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/pulls/3090","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3090","diff_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3090.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3090.patch"},"body":"Fixes #3088\n\nThis seems like the best way to handle tiles deletion for now.

we have ability to save scenes to file, and attach them to the scene like almost any ordinary\npredefined node, the next natural step would be to to allow people to convert these scenes into some kind of \"node plugin\" that could be shared even more easly between projects in more easily and 'standardized' way than currently. \nBasically when we put 'Node Plugin' folder somewhere inside the project folder, editor should automatically detect it (or allow to add it from settings) and add proper entry in \"Create new node\" window.  (Additionally  there could be a folder inside ~/.godot/ that would collect all the 'node plugins' for use in all our projects without the need to define them in each project separately)\n\nCouple observations:\n- There is need for some kind of 'public/protected' modifier for gdscript, to disallow users changing internal state of 'plugin node' in not planned way.\n- Scripts that are added to root node of plugin should not be visible in inspector, and user should be able to define it's own script for this node if he need (just like it's with build in nodes) (I assume this script should by default extend after the script from 'plugin node').\n- There should be possibility to contain more than one 'Node definition' inside single plugin. Some plugins might require to operate on higher amount of node types in order to work (i.e. StateMachine node might need to operate on 'State' nodes). Guess the easiest way to achieve this might be to simply allow to define main folder that contain more than one 'root node plugin' at the same level (referencing to other plugins(node types) would be easy thanks to relative paths).  \n- In \"Create new node\" window there should be some kind of separator to separate build in nodes, from those that comes from the plugins folder.\n- Other things that need to be considered is to allow plugin creator to define an icon for 'plugin node'\n- Godot help system should be able to display descriptions written by plugin creators for public functions, members, signals and the plugin itself. \n- I know that there are currently available \"editor plugins\", which allows developers to write widgets that are used by Godot editor itself. It might be good idea to allow distribute 'scene plugins' together with these editor ones in a transparent - not noticeable for user - way, since I can imagine someone might want to write 'node plugin' that might be editable only via editor plugin.\n- Creating a plugin should not be very complicated process and should allow developers to gain better reusability of some parts of the project (even if they want these plugins only for internal use like \"Enemy\" node, and thanks to help system developers could easily document those plugins for their less technical co-workers).\n- Node plugins should not be allowed to be created, if they are using any resource that is located  outside of the main folder for given plugin. Thus all paths should be relative, and all inner scenes should be located inside plugin folder.\n- As an exception from above,  there should be possibility to define plugin that is depended on another plugin (one or more).\n- It also seems that nodes that are part of the editor plugin should not be visible from the outside world (someone who is using plugin node as a root node for it's scene could be very surprised by what  get_children() is returning). Some random idea: As alternative provide some global way to set node visibility as ?public/protected/private? In this case I don't have clear idea how this exactly should work, and be represented in editor right now, guess some feedback from main devs is needed. \n- Idea on how creation of such plugin could look: Scene -> convert to plugin option. After selecting, some kind of simple wizard/guide could be launched that would validate scene and look for not relative paths in .gd (?or resources that are outside the folder?) and show validation alerts. There also could be some short \"howto\" in this place, as well as other necessary steps (depending on idea implementation: i.e file icon chose, pointing out which folder is a main folder for the plugin as a whole, etc).\n- Sounds like implementation of some of these things would require some additions to gdscipt. I know that in 2.1 there are plans to add new scripting language with static typing, maybe creation of 'node plugins' should be possible when using this new language? \n- Also this would be some start point for developers to create more generic, **encapsulated** scenes that could be more easily shared on the upcoming asset store. \n\nThese ideas in their core are currently generally achievable by using some rules when creating scenes. This feature request is opened more in hope to standardize some things and make them more automatic, native and pleasant to use. \n\n**Edit: Further (maybe little crazy) ideas:**\n- It's totally possible currently to write 'subscene', that in order to work need some other node that is delivered by the user from editor depending on the situation (currently we can just add a node to the scene loaded from file, or click 'edit' button and add node to any child of subscene). But there are some problems with this approach: \n  - first of all, the user need to know internal structure of the node-plugin, it need to know where to add given node and how to name it.\n  - Node-plugins by it's nature should hide it's internal implementation from the outside world\n    This problem might be partially solved by exported variables, but this is not always straightforward (for example plugin could want from user to provide Position3D nodes to point some concrete transform).\n  - Because of all this it would be cool if there could be an ability to define plugin-placeholder nodes, that would be visible as a childrens of a plugin-node when it's added to the editor (All other children are hidden). Thanks to these nodes user will be able to 'inject' some concrete nodes  inside the plugin by replacing those placeholders. \n  - Another approach to this problem would be to just give ability for selected nodes to be visible in scene tree editor as a child of node-plugin. (Not involving any kind of placeholder concept), this would allow users to modify these concrete internal nodes ([move]/[scale]/[add new child] - exactly the same way how it's possible currently with any child when SubScene is editable).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3076","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3076/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3076/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/godotengine/godot/issues/3076/events","html_url":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/3076","id":122070362,"number":3076,"title":"Option
