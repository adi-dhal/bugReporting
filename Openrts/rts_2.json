WeaponLink value=\"TankCanon\"\n-  WeaponLink value=\"TankMachinegun\"\n-  WeaponLink value=\"TankFrontLaser\"\n\nThen the turret value would be stored inside the Weapon himself as : \n# Weapon\n\n```\n<Weapon id=\"TankCanon\".>\n    <UIName value=\"ubber powerful canon\"/> (I don't think this is needed)\n    <EffectLink value=\"StdDamage\"/>\n    <Range value=\"5\"/>\n    <ScanRange

(How far the weapon can shoot)\n- Period (Delay between two attack)\n- ScanRange (how far the unit start moving to get in range)\n\nOptional value : \n- TurretLink (Is this weapon a turret)\n- UIName

though the main purpose of OpenRTS seems to be a general RTS engine, good software development practice suggests that this is developed while implementing a practical example.\nI like the current idea to have a simple and very stylized art-style... a bit like what the game \"Planetary Annihilation\" is also doing. At the very least it allows rapid art creation, especially when the units are mainly non-humanoid and thus only require simple animations like a turret or some particle effects.\n\nFor the overall style and background I was thinking about expanding the existing art set towards a post-apocalyptic snowball-earth scenario that should go well with the more or less untextured low-poly art. \nThe first faction would be then rather low tech tanks \"diesel-punk\" that the surviving population uses. The other faction could be aliens that invade the \"empty\" planet and try to terraform pockets on earth (with strange plants and fungi etc.). A third faction could be returning \"high-tech\" terrans that left shortly before the catastrophe to live in generation ships, but have now returned to \"safe\" the home-world from the alien invasion (and are not really welcome be the local humans either).\n\nFocus would be competitive multiplayer and maybe SP/coop scenarios to play against an AI.\n\nAs you can see it is a bit of a Starcraft like scenario, that requires a snowy base level style, an alien terraform plant style, and maybe an orbital platform style for creating the various levels.\n\nI am willing to work on the 3D art assets, but I will probably need some help as I don't have that much time. Therefore keeping the art requirements low is key to success I think.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/methusalah/OpenRTS/issues/63/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/methusalah/OpenRTS/issues/62","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/methusalah/OpenRTS","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/methusalah/OpenRTS/issues/62/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/methusalah/OpenRTS/issues/62/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/methusalah/OpenRTS/issues/62/events","html_url":"https://github.com/methusalah/OpenRTS/issues/62","id":74665176,"number":62,"title":"general framework software architecture","user":{"login":"meltzow","id":1238001,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1238001?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meltzow","html_url":"https://github.com/meltzow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meltzow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meltzow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meltzow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meltzow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meltzow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meltzow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meltzow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meltzow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meltzow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":122527749,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/methusalah/OpenRTS/labels/aesthetic","name":"aesthetic","color":"fbca04","default":false},{"id":122527713,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/methusalah/OpenRTS/labels/long%20time%20goal","name":"long time goal","color":"5319e7","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2015-05-09T12:44:12Z","updated_at":"2015-05-21T05:29:08Z","closed_at":"2015-05-21T05:29:08Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hi all,\nOpenRTS should be a framework which supports any kind of common real-time strategy gameplay, design and control. With the current features (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjYJWFQFIVE\" target=\"_blank\">the engine in action !</a>)  OpenRTS has the potential the crow up to a powerful game engine.\nBut we need a concept for extending and changing the generic functions of OpenRTS. We cant implement all wishes of all developers, which want to use OpenRTs. On the other hand, we must extend OpenRTS to support some new features like sound, networking and so on. The software-architecture must be prepared for this. \nIn our last project we have very good experience with an EntityComponentSystem. Here are some explanations:\nhttp://wiki.jmonkeyengine.org/doku.php/jme3:contributions:entitysystem:introduction\nor\nhttp://wiki.jmonkeyengine.org/doku.php/jme3:contributions:entitysystem:advanced\n\nThis software architecture means a big refactoring, but solves a lot a problems which will coming in later versions of OpenRTS like multiheritance in models, codecomplexity in the controllers and extending/overriding functions in game implementations.\n\nAny opinion on that? Are there any other plans for the future?\nthanks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/methusalah/OpenRTS/issues/62/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/methusalah/OpenRTS/issues/61","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/methusalah/OpenRTS","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/methusalah/OpenRTS/issues/61/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/methusalah/OpenRTS/issues/61/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/methusalah/OpenRTS/issues/61/events","html_url":"https://github.com/methusalah/OpenRTS/issues/61","id":74624212,"number":61,"title":"Ramp
