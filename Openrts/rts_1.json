have cloned the latest repository (as of an hour ago) and imported OpenRTS-core and OpenRTS-example as gradle projects in Eclipse. When trying to run Game.java (the main class in example), I run into the following exception - \nSEVERE: Uncaught exception thrown in Thread[LWJGL Renderer Thread,5,main]\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n    at com.jme3.material.Material.<init>(Material.java:120)\n    at view.material.MaterialManager.getColor(MaterialManager.java:62)\n    at view.MapView.createSky(MapView.java:89)\n    at view.MapView.<init>(MapView.java:55)\n    at Game.simpleInitApp(Game.java:27)\n    at app.OpenRTSApplication.initialize(OpenRTSApplication.java:156)\n    at com.jme3.system.lwjgl.LwjglAbstractDisplay.initInThread(LwjglAbstractDisplay.java:130)\n    at com.jme3.system.lwjgl.LwjglAbstractDisplay.run(LwjglAbstractDisplay.java:207)\n    at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\n\nRunning with JDK1.8 on Mac OS X and Eclipse Luna.

I am totally newbie to jmonkey, so I am not really sure how jmonkey assets/resources are pulled into open-rts. Will keep checking the jmonkey jars pulled by Gradle to see if the above asset exists or not ...\n\nAny tips to get the Game running from Eclipse or atleast start the Example Game from command line using Gradle?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/methusalah/OpenRTS/issues/104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/methusalah/OpenRTS/issues/103","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/methusalah/OpenRTS","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/methusalah/OpenRTS/issues/103/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/methusalah/OpenRTS/issues/103/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/methusalah/OpenRTS/issues/103/events","html_url":"https://github.com/methusalah/OpenRTS/pull/103","id":107390628,"number":103,"title":"Made many small updates/corrections to README.md.","user":{"login":"mfreema5","id":5863302,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5863302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfreema5","html_url":"https://github.com/mfreema5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfreema5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfreema5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfreema5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfreema5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfreema5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfreema5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfreema5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfreema5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfreema5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-09-20T12:30:32Z","updated_at":"2015-09-20T20:17:20Z","closed_at":"2015-09-20T20:17:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/methusalah/OpenRTS/pulls/103","html_url":"https://github.com/methusalah/OpenRTS/pull/103","diff_url":"https://github.com/methusalah/OpenRTS/pull/103.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/methusalah/OpenRTS/pull/103.patch"},"body":"Rebased onto commits in Pull Request #101 .\n\nIncludes:\n- Corrections of spelling/grammar errors\n- Addition of links to relevant pages/anchors\n- A few small rewrites (that hopefully improve clarity)\n\nNote: I verbified the section to “Licensing” to avoid having to choose between “Licence” and “License”.
