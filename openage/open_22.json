Central management of current loglevel\n  - `--verbose`, `--quiet`\n- Program has one single entry point: `openage.__main__.main()`\n  - run with `python3 -m openage`\n  - alternatively: `./run`\n  - subcommands: `game`, `test`, `codegen`\n- Media file conversion is now done when launching the game.\n\nBuildsystem:\n- added valgrind-python.supp, a valgrind suppression file.\n- added basic whitespace compliance checking for textfiles\n- added pylint code compliance checking\n  - Many files are not yet pylint-compliant; those have a header\n    '# TODO pylint: disable=C,R,whatever categories'\n- added selective code compliance checking (closes #229)\n- re-worked Makefile targets\n\ncloses #217 \n\nSee the various doc files, including [pyinterface](https://github.com/mic-e/openage/blob/pyinterface/doc/code/pyinterface.md), [testing](https://github.com/mic-e/openage/blob/pyinterface/doc/code/testing.md)\n\nSome things are still remaining to do, but they in no way prevent merging:\n- write interface for `FSLikeObject`\n  - use that interface for all asset handling (in C++)\n  - add `inotify` support to `FSLikeObject`\n- support for other sources for `openage.convert` (setup disk/.iso #82)\n\nNote: If you wish to start work that derives from this before it's been merged, which you should, if you're about to start any new branch, base it on [this commit](https://github.com/mic-e/openage/commit/483c482649fa026cee8fe4024237f34f23255ab3).

I used lambda expressions to replace the original switch statement.\n- You'll be able to point from keys to actions. This is currently hardcoded, but will be saved in a file. \n\nThere's still some open questions:\n- Currently everything is for `SDL_KEYUP` events. It would be easy to extend this to also incluse `SDL_KEYDOWN` events, but do we need this? (we'll need key modifiers like control as well)\n- The meaning of the current `y`, `z`, `x` and `c` key bindings is unclear. What do they do?

The first one is the pseudo-HTML (it's not HTML as no proper closing tags are being used) that's being used for markup. The other thing is placeholders.\n\nMy suggestion is the following:\n- Use a markdown subset for markup: `*italic*`, `**bold**`, `***bold italic***`. Maybe also the underscore variants (although I prefer simplicity).\n- Use a placeholder syntax inspired by Python 3's named `.format()` syntax: `Create **Samurai** ({cost})`. I don't think we need formatting syntax like `!s` or `:.2`.\n- Convert all uppercase placeholders to lowercase. Convert camelCase (not sure if that even exists) to snake_case.\n- Strip unneeded whitespace\n\nSo the examples above would become:\n- `{team}`\n- `**Mini-map**`\n- `Create **Samurai** ({cost})`\n\nAn alternative placeholder could be like in the Django template language: `{{ placeholder_name }}`. That would also leave open the possibility for filters: `{{ begin_date|date:\"d.m.y H:M\" }}`\n\nOpinions?\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/10198376-string-resource-markup-format?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F371436&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F371436&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\n</bountysource-plugin>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/265","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/265/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/265/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/265/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/pull/265","id":65068005,"number":265,"title":"[WIP] Media versioning","user":{"login":"TheJJ","id":673543,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/673543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ","html_url":"https://github.com/TheJJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":142835352,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/labels/assets","name":"assets","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":142056555,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/labels/nice%20new%20thing%20%E2%98%BA","name":"nice new thing ☺","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":142245512,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/labels/python","name":"python","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-03-29T14:55:52Z","updated_at":"2016-10-07T00:06:55Z","closed_at":"2015-08-19T23:49:38Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/pulls/265","html_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/pull/265","diff_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/pull/265.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/pull/265.patch"},"body":"My attempt on versioning the media files.

Take the following example files:\r\n\r\n`a.h`\r\n\r\n``` cpp\r\nvoid f();\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * docstring goes here\r\n */\r\nstruct A {\r\n    /**\r\n     * member function docstring goes here\r\n     */\r\n    template<int i>\r\n    int member_function(int arg) {\r\n        return arg + i;\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n`b.h`\r\n\r\n``` cpp\r\n#include \"a.h\"\r\nstruct B {\r\n    A *member_struct;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n`c.h`\r\n\r\n``` cpp\r\n#include \"b.h\"\r\nstruct C {\r\n    B *member_struct;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nEvery file that includes `c.h` will automatically include `b.h`, with all its own dependencies, including `a.h`. It will even need to parse the implementation of `a::member_function`. As a result, in practice everything that includes `engine.h` in openage automatically includes the huge majority of all openage header files.\r\n\r\nHowever, `c.h` does not actually _need_ to know about the contents of `struct B`, it just needs to know that `B` _is_ a `struct`, so I suggest splitting the headers into:\r\n\r\n`a_decl.h`\r\n\r\n``` cpp\r\nvoid f();\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * docstring goes here\r\n */\r\nstruct A;\r\n```\r\n\r\n`a.h`\r\n\r\n``` cpp\r\n#include \"a_decl.h\"\r\n\r\nstruct A {\r\n    /**\r\n     * member function docstring goes here\r\n     */\r\n    template<int i>\r\n    int member_function(int arg) {\r\n        return arg + i;\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n`b_decl.h`\r\n\r\n``` cpp\r\nstruct B;\r\n```\r\n\r\n`b.h`\r\n\r\n``` cpp\r\n#include \"b_decl.h\"\r\n\r\n#include \"a_decl.h\"\r\nstruct B {\r\n    A *member_struct;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n`c_decl.h`\r\n\r\n``` cpp\r\nstruct C;\r\n```\r\n\r\n`c.h`\r\n\r\n``` cpp\r\n#include \"c_decl.h\"\r\n\r\n#include \"b_decl.h\"\r\nstruct C {\r\n    B *member_struct;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs an added bonus, this also prevents any unnecessary circular header dependencies.\r\n\r\nTo avoid unneeded parsing of template implementations, in addition `a.h` may be split into\r\n\r\n`a.h`\r\n\r\n``` cpp\r\n#include \"a_decl.h\"\r\n\r\nstruct A {\r\n    template<int i>\r\n    int member_function(int arg);\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n`a_impl.h`\r\n\r\n``` cpp\r\n#include \"a.h\"\r\n\r\ntemplate<int i>\r\nint A::member_function(int arg) {\r\n    return arg + i;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI do not recommend making this policy mandatory, just to use it for headers where significant compile time reductions are to be expected.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/262","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/262/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/262/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/262/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/pull/262","id":65005840,"number":262,"title":"Abort
