system:** Ubuntu 16.04 (64-bit)\r\n**System Python Path:** `/usr/bin/python`\r\n**Anaconda Path:** `/opt/anaconda3/bin/python`\r\n\r\nI forked this repository and pulled the latest code on my local machine. I had Anaconda installed already at `/opt/anaconda3` with its binary path in my `$PATH` variable. When I first ran `./configure` I had some issues with Anaconda (sorry I don't remember what issues I had). So, I decided to switch my Python interpreter to the one that comes with Ubuntu at `/usr/bin/python`. I removed Anaconda's Python Path from my `$PATH` variable in `.zshrc`, `.bashrc` and `.bashrc_profile` and restarted my machine. However, when I ran `./configure` again, it still picked Anaconda's Python binary instead of `/usr/bin/python`. I even ran `python` manually in the same session but it correctly picked Ubuntu's Python binary instead of Anaconda's.\r\n\r\nI got annoyed and removed Anaconda completely and this time it correctly picked Python binary from `/usr/bin/python`. But, I started getting other issues now. It seems the build system was still looking for Anaconda's libraries (I don't know why and how). The build system even had couple of issues with `libfreetype6-dev` library which could be solved only by symlinking the include files in the right places\r\n\r\nBut now, I'm stuck with this nasty one.\r\n```\r\nmake[3]: *** No rule to make target '/opt/anaconda3/lib/libfontconfig.so', needed by 'libopenage/libopenage.so.0'.  Stop.\r\nCMakeFiles/Makefile2:1482: recipe for target 'libopenage/CMakeFiles/libopenage.dir/all' failed\r\nmake[2]: *** [libopenage/CMakeFiles/libopenage.dir/all] Error 2\r\nMakefile:138: recipe for target 'all' failed\r\nmake[1]: *** [all] Error 2\r\nMakefile:33: recipe for target 'build' failed\r\nmake: *** [build] Error 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've completely removed Anaconda and `which python` returns `/usr/bin/python`. Does anyone has a slightest idea of what's going wrong?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/803/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/802","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/802/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/802/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/802/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/pull/802","id":223664731,"number":802,"title":"Buildsystem: Added Benchmarking","user":{"login":"Tomatower","id":15938546,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/15938546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tomatower","html_url":"https://github.com/Tomatower","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tomatower/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tomatower/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tomatower/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tomatower/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tomatower/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tomatower/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tomatower/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tomatower/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tomatower/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":142055767,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/labels/buildsystem","name":"buildsystem","color":"eb6420","default":false},{"id":64037880,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/labels/improvement","name":"improvement","color":"84b6eb","default":false},{"id":142056555,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/labels/nice%20new%20thing%20%E2%98%BA","name":"nice new thing ☺","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-04-23T20:25:20Z","updated_at":"2017-05-02T23:02:51Z","closed_at":"2017-04-24T20:39:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/pulls/802","html_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/pull/802","diff_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/pull/802.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/pull/802.patch"},"body":"fixes #167\r\n\r\nadded ```./run test -b BENCHMARK ``` for benchmarking the code. \r\n\r\nIt runs the benchmark until the whole block takes longer than 5 seconds, totalling in 10 seconds for the whole process.
