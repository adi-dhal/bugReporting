I choose the [sol2](https://github.com/ThePhD/sol2) framework, because its a simple header file. For compiling you need the lua 5.1 dev files of your distro. The whole thing are event based hooks, so if theres nothing to during the gameloop, there will be nothing done.\r\n\r\nA maintainer should add labels experimental, proofofconcept. This pull request is **not** for merge. The script.cpp is ugly and would need some serious rewriting.\r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\nThere is a singleton to register lua scriptfiles(you can have more than 1). The hooks we decide to implement are written in c++ and call the scripts via member method. The method does all the work with lua code and change the gamestate if necessary.\r\n\r\nexample hook:\r\n``` cpp\r\nfor(auto script : ScriptSingleton::instance().scripts) {\r\n\r\n script->onResourceChange(this->color,resource,amount,this->resources[resource]);\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think lua is the better choise for ingame scripting.

(currently unused) DoublyLinkedList had some real issues.\r\nWhile writing tests, I discovered many things, but the real interesting things were those, that should have raised a compilation error, but didn't. I guess they didn't, because we defined everything in a header and the functions containing uncompilable code were never called(referenced).\r\n\r\nI'm not exactly sure, what we can learn from this.\r\nI would suggest using header files for declaration and a separate file for definition. When trying to create `doubly_linked_list.o` from `doubly_linked_list.cpp`, that should have raised an error.\r\nBesides that: If we keep everything in one header, doesn't that lead to every compilation unit recreating the machine code for that
