sure you're all aware of openage's current C++ [whitespace style](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/blob/master/doc/code_style/tabs_n_spaces.md), which involves using tabs for indentation, and spaces for alignment.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, due to the nature of C++, automatic checking is non-trivial, to say the least.\r\n\r\nAlmost all contributions - especially by new contributors - are plagued by whitespace issues.\r\n\r\nFor reviewers, it is annoying to manually check the style for every contribution, nag about and patiently wait for them to be fixed, but I imagine it is even more annoying for contributors who have to waste time on the ridiculous exercise of fixing them.\r\n\r\nSwitching over to a whitespace indentation style (namely: 4 spaces, similar to our PEP8 Python style) would remove many of the annoyances. A project-wide ban on tab characters could be enforced by the existing code compliance checker.\r\n\r\nTabs remain my personal favorite indentation style, but most editors and programmers seem to prefer indenting by spaces these days. Please share your opinions on the subject, so we may come to a satisfying solution.\r\n\r\nIf we decide to switch over to spaces, I'll implement the change in the near future. The commit would break almost all automatic merging, so I'll wait until most open pull requests have been merged.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/313/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/312","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/312/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/312/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/312/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/issues/312","id":83072186,"number":312,"title":"Why not FIFE?","user":{"login":"fricklerhandwerk","id":6599296,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6599296?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fricklerhandwerk","html_url":"https://github.com/fricklerhandwerk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fricklerhandwerk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fricklerhandwerk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fricklerhandwerk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fricklerhandwerk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fricklerhandwerk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fricklerhandwerk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fricklerhandwerk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fricklerhandwerk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fricklerhandwerk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":64037882,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/labels/question","name":"question","color":"cc317c","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2015-05-31T12:02:18Z","updated_at":"2015-06-04T14:29:38Z","closed_at":"2015-06-04T14:29:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I was reading around the nets and wondered why you don't use an existing 2D game engine like [FIFE](http://www.fifengine.net/).

like the TC were not able to be built as the foundation got removed instantly (floating outlines for buildings get removed when a building begins construction, here the annex caused the TC to remove itself)\n\nThe TC has several stages wrt collisions, the floating stage causes no collisions, the construction stage allows no units on the foundation, and once completed construction parts of the tc

designs other than aoc, but makes it hard for things like upgrading units)\r\n\r\n2) Unit types hold all attributes and units have a minimal set of values like current HP. Easy to handle unit upgrades but could be difficult to extend and modify the game in future.\r\n\r\n3) Unit types and Unit instances have the same attributes, looking up attributes on a unit first checks the instance, and if not there will check the Unit Type, This does the best of both since custom attributes are supported but not required.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/299/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/298","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/298/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/298/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/298/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/pull/298","id":73000473,"number":298,"title":"Fixed keybind modifiers","user":{"login":"detrumi","id":5758008,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5758008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/detrumi","html_url":"https://github.com/detrumi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/detrumi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/detrumi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/detrumi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/detrumi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/detrumi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/detrumi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/detrumi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/detrumi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/detrumi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":142245448,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/labels/c++","name":"c++","color":"000000","default":false},{"id":64037880,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/labels/improvement","name":"improvement","color":"84b6eb","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-05-04T11:51:38Z","updated_at":"2015-05-06T13:36:21Z","closed_at":"2015-05-06T13:06:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/pulls/298","html_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/pull/298","diff_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/pull/298.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/pull/298.patch"},"body":"Keybinds (#284) were influenced by keys like caps lock and num lock, and stopped working if one of those keys was active.

functionality to villagers. Also fixing bugs while I find them.\n## Implemented features:\n- [x] Place a villager with the `v` key\n- [x] Kill a selected unit with `delete`\n- [x] Hide some UI elements when in `Actions mode`\n- [x] Villagers can build some buildings with the `q`, `w`, `e` and `r` keys (with `control` key for military buildings)\n- [x] Set current player with 1-8 keys, create units with correct color\n- [x] You can select multiple of your own units or buildings, but only 1 enemy at a time\n## Found/fixed bugs:\n- [x] Most click commands should be on mouse-up, not mouse-down\n- [x] Dead units can be selected\n- [x] Villagers can build another player's buildings\n- [x] Building preview image is always from player 1\n- [ ] Some editor building previews are always in blue, regardless of the current player\n- [x] Enemy units can be controlled\n## Fixed by Jon0 in another branch:\n- Villagers work in place when building can't be placed (something in the way)\n- When building with multiple villagers, only one of them starts building, the others work in place\n- Villager building animation sometimes is choppy/slow\n- Deleting a building while it's being built sometimes crashes the game (or makes the building reappear)\n- Villagers sometimes invisible while in attacking animation\n## Won't fix bugs:\n\nSmall bugs that probably won't be fixed any time soon\n- Game freezes a bit when moving units, especially when clicking outside of the map (pathfinding just slow?)\n- Buildings can be placed on water (terrain doesn't have enough information for this yet, I think)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/290","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/290/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/290/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/290/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/issues/290","id":70895807,"number":290,"title":"Gamedata sometimes not loading","user":{"login":"detrumi","id":5758008,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5758008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/detrumi","html_url":"https://github.com/detrumi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/detrumi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/detrumi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/detrumi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/detrumi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/detrumi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/detrumi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/detrumi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/detrumi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/detrumi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":64037882,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/labels/question","name":"question","color":"cc317c","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-04-25T11:32:43Z","updated_at":"2015-04-25T11:48:30Z","closed_at":"2015-04-25T11:48:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"When loading the game for the first time since booting, the game data sometimes takes a long time to load.\n\nI've had times where it loaded after a few minutes, and sometimes it didn't seem to load at all.
