a large second screen minimap with more detail. Perhaps showing unit icons instead of just colored pixels.\r\n\r\nThe Battlefield version is done using a web interface (not sure if connected to local game or central server). For openage it could be done in any variety of options.\r\n\r\nI bring this up since I've been doing some basic research into this before I discovered openage. My plan was to either intercept network traffic (like voobly does for observer proxy) or read the record game file as it is being written (assuming it dumps fairly often).\r\n\r\nThere is some code out there to parse the starting point of recorded games and stats and what not, which voobly uses on their site, but not a lot of info on the meat of the file. Does openage support recorded game files? As such I imagine I could look there.\r\n\r\nI would be interested in creating this if it sounds feasible, although my plan was do it as a local webservice. If there is information on recorded game format perhaps it would be better to create it standalone so it works for AoC, HD, and openage.
