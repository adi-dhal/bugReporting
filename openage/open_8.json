Attributes system improvements goals:\r\n\r\n- [x] Abstract shared and ushared attributes\r\n  - [x] share method\r\n  - [x] ~~copy method (???)~~\r\n- [x] Convert `attr_map_t` into a proper class (`Attributes`?)\r\n  - [x] implement\r\n    - [x] add `attributes.cpp` (?)\r\n  - [x] refactor\r\n- [x] Split attributes and refactor changes\r\n  - [x] hitpoints -> hitpoints + current hitpoints (issue #651)\r\n  - [x] building -> building + dropsite (semi-implemented)\r\n  - [x] attack: move attack stance elsewher\r\n- [x] Change the worker atrribute\r\n  - [x] rename\r\n  - [x] split into unshared and shared\r\n    - [x] carrying resources\r\n    - [x] move worker action graphics to somewhere else ($1)\r\n  - [x] gather rate per resource\r\n  - [x] move attack type (used only for villagers) from attack ($2)\r\n- [x] Multitype attribute (for unit with subtypes: villages, trebuchets)\r\n  - [x] implement\r\n  - [x] refactor producers and fix $1 and $2\r\n- [x] Change type bugs\r\n  - [x] use `reinitialise` instead of `reinitialise` in order to keep the unshared attributes (eg. life)\r\n- [x] ~~Actions attribute calls optimize~~\r\n  - [x] ~~move has/get attribute in constructor (call once and store) (?)~~\r\n  - [x] ~~move basic operations inside attributes~~\r\n- [x] Add doc\r\n\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\n- All files including `attributes.h`: `unit_type.h`, `unit.h`, `action.h`\r\n- `Attributes` methods:\r\n  - bool add/has/removeAttribute (hide all map methods)\r\n  - Attribute get<attr_type>\r\n\r\n### Bugs found (and solved) on the way\r\n\r\n- Health reset every time villager changes resources (eg. from wood to stone) (wait... no)\r\n- One gather rate for all resources\r\n- Search for new building to build includes enemy's building\r\n- Towers auto attack\r\n-
