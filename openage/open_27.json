don't think age2 used fancy shaders for coloring... so... from http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=190070326:\n\n\"The player color means which color you used in your bmp as player color. This is important as the AoE palette has 8 exactly defined values for every players color shades. When extracting a bmp, every pixel that is supposed to change it's color according to players color will be colored in the chosen player color (default is blue). To convert a real color back to the undefined player color one, you have to set this. If you choose red for example, no red pixel - even if it matches a red player color value - will be interpreted as player color but shown as red - for every player.\n\nOn the other hand, every pixel that changed to a color shade of the chosen player color while converting - even if it wasn't meant to have players color - will have it ingame. And every pixel supposed to have the players color but doesn't have the right color value after converting - will not change its color ingame.\"\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/111","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/111/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/111/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/111/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/issues/111","id":47759884,"number":111,"title":"Implement minimap","user":{"login":"franciscod","id":726447,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/726447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/franciscod","html_url":"https://github.com/franciscod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franciscod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franciscod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franciscod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franciscod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franciscod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franciscod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franciscod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franciscod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franciscod/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":198543598,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/labels/just%20do%20it","name":"just do it","color":"3fe5bf","default":false},{"id":142056555,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/labels/nice%20new%20thing%20%E2%98%BA","name":"nice new thing ☺","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":35,"created_at":"2014-11-04T20:18:07Z","updated_at":"2015-08-12T13:49:07Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Should we limit the world terrain size for this?
