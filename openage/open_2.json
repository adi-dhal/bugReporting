filesystems and apparently some mac systems (#874) have case insensitive filesystems.\r\n\r\nOur `fslike` system was built for case-sensitive filesystems like Linux has.\r\nSo we have a test in `openage/util/fslike/test.py` that assumes the underlying filesystem is case-sensitive: It checks that when just an `a` is created, then an `A` is created and redirected to be the same `a`, and then we test if only `a` exists and not `A`, as `A` was redirected to `a`.\r\n\r\nIf now the underlying filesystem is case-insensitive, it will report that `A` and `a` exist, which breaks the test.\r\n\r\nSolution: test if the underlying filesystem is case sensitive or not and adjust the test to expect different results

step towards #9.\r\nFixes #508 with a modification - VS2017 instead of VS2015.\r\nSupersedes #582 (credits to @YellowOnion).\r\n\r\n<del>\r\n## The procedure (this is here for my recollection later)\r\n- Get the dependencies using `vcpkg`.\r\n- Build/install the missing dependency `opusfile` manually.\r\n- Copy `dirent.h` from `vcpkg`'s downloads directory - it's named `fontconfig-dirent.h`.\r\n- Build using CMake - the usual workflow.\r\n- Install the `DejaVu Serif Book` font and copy the configuration to the fontconfig directory.\r\n- Modify the environment variables required to make the program run (hacks required before proper packaging).\r\n</del>\r\n\r\n## A summary of the changes\r\n- A majority of the changes are for selectively compiling some code using preprocessor macros `_MSC_VER` or `_WIN32`. The former for MSVC specific code, and the latter if it is applicable to other compilers on Windows also.\r\n- Introduction of ~~`LIBOPENAGE_API`~~`OAAPI` for decorating the DLL's entry points for Windows. `__declspec(dllexport)` when compiling the DLL's sources, `__declspec(dllimport)` for the code including the header files only - the API user.\r\n  - Added an introduction in `doc/code/pyinterface.md`.\r\n- ~~**[Disrupting change]** In `libopenage/error/error.h`, the variadic macro `ENSURE` has been changed to a two-argument macro. I left a `TODO` - kindly respond with the approach to choose here.~~\r\n- Python changes are mostly for path handling - the native path separator for Windows is a `'\\\\'` (weird, agreed).\r\n- CMake changes include path handling, finding dependent libraries and packages.\r\n- **[Coordinate system hacks]** The macros CONCAT and LOOP retain their variadic implementation, with the condition that they have a smaller arguments supported limit (3 for both). This should be superseded by the coordinate system overhaul in #662.\r\n- `libopenage/error/stackanalyzer.cpp` contains the skeleton code for #479. Without #480 though, I don't expect it to provide a lot of useful information. The change includes a bug-fix in the GNU execinfo section.\r\n- Included `ciso646` which provides the expansion for `and`, `or`, `not`, `xor`, etc.\r\n- Added a document describing the build instructions: `doc/build_instructions/windows_msvc.md`.\r\n\r\nI've left a bunch of `TODO`s and `HACK`s around in the code. I can try to address the critical ones pointed out by the reviewers, the rest can be addressed subsequently.\r\nI've built the project on Windows (using MSVC) only. I'll rely on the CI reports for other platforms (apologies for the cache thrashing).
