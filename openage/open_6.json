way we can try to stop all workers before we continue to throw the exceptions.\r\n\r\nThis way workers are prevented on running with deinitialized data and segfaulting, which hides the original excpetion.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nIn `Engine::loop` an exception is thrown because of an OpenGL `OUT_OF_MEMORY` error. Because the excpetion is not catched the Engines destructor and therefor in the end the destructor for an asset manager is called. However a job performing loading operations like `GameSpec::load_terrain` still has a referenced to the now invalid AssetManager and works with him in a normal fashion. This results in a segfault at some point e.g. when merging directory strings.\r\n\r\nOne way to prevent this would be using `shared_ptr` so that the necessary resources are present for the jobs as long as they need them. However because the excpetion will kill the game we dont want to still loads things afterwards. So just stoping all workers if an exception is thrown and then continuing with the \"exception-flow\" should be sufficient.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/766/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/765","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/765/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/765/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/765/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/issues/765","id":214378772,"number":765,"title":"Add

the `audio::DynamicResource` waits for `this->chunk_infos.front()` or `this->chunk_infos.pop()` (both have the same condition variable) forever because of that\r\n* The main thread can't add new

That means there will be no regular update interval in the simulation. It becomes *event based*!\r\n\r\nBasically, on each event we always try to predict it's influence to the world as much into the future as \"it makes sense\". For that, we have a space-time model of the game state, that is, all the data is time-relative. We can then align the event into the spacetime and make required adjustments to the predictions.\r\n\r\nThe differences to the standard ticked-approach are not that big, especially in the simulation logic itself. Just the approach and data storage is totally different.\r\n\r\n* As our world is 3d (we do want to have terrain height..), we have to store spacetime in 4d\r\n* An entity has a 2d or even 3d hitbox, which, dragged over time is a **Tube** (i.e. curve with volume)\r\n* The movement and the changing properties of the entity is a **Curve**\r\n\r\nQuestions to solve:\r\n* How far do we calculate into the future?\r\n  * Probably depends on the event (pathfinding, research start, attacking, ...)\r\n  * Many events are easy to predict for `t -> ∞` (building progress, research, ...)\r\n  * Can account server load to abort further recursion\r\n* Which influence in the spacetime wins?\r\n  * Events that would be anticipated by a intelligent being can already be accounted\r\n  * Events that can't be anticipated or the entity to be influenced is dumb must always win\r\n* When do we continue calculating at points where we aborted further prediction calculation?\r\n  * Could be done by seting up a \"continue calculation\" keyframe at the point where calculation was stopped before\r\n\r\nYes, it sounds crazy, but it may work.
