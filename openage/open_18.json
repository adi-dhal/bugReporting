python sources in openage folder are replicated in build dir.\n- cpp, html, and cython modules are now generated in build dir\n  and therefore keeps the source directory clean.\n- pxd files are generated in the build dir.\n- removed os-dependent functionality like `symlinks` and `find`.\n- replaced add_cython_modules with better api `add_cython_module`.\n- with these changes, individual cython modules depend on only their\n  source files. Therefore, changes to cython module source files\n  will trigger build of only dependent targets. Also, removed the\n  need to explicitly specify pxd files through `add_pxds`.\n- in general, simplified the build system by removing the custom targets\n  compilepy, inplacemodules, cleanpxdgen, cythonize, cleancython.\n- As CMake is now responsible for managing timestamps of pxd files\n  and corresponding source files, pxdgen is now simpler.\n- fixed devmode detection.\n\nFixes #398 , #391 \n\nThis completes the changes required for \"fully\" out-of-source builds. The only files generated in source tree are `codegen` files. These files are not dependent on any configuration and therefore acceptable (for now).\n\nAlso removed the generation of configuration dependent files like `inplace_module_list` in configuration independent dir `bin/py/`. Therefore, the project can now be built using multi config cmake generators (Tested with Xcode).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/399/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/398","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/398/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/398/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/398/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/issues/398","id":112786398,"number":398,"title":"Better

Now we are grabbing the correct library directory using distutils, and also generating the library name the same way as the python-config tool. These are then given to the linker with -L and -l, respectively.\n\nIn the future, we should use the python-config tool to grab all ldflags and cflags. I currently don't use the python-config tool because it can include many flags (e.g, extra libraries) that we simply aren't ready to incorporate yet, and therefore would require much filtering.

setup:**\nMac OS X Yosemite 10.10.4 (14E46)\nPython 3.4 installed with `brew install python3`\nUsing g++ version 5.2.0\n\n**The symptom:** When building the \"run\" executable, the linker fails with error `ld: library not found for -lpython3.4`\n\nMy investigation reveals the following:\n\n**The superficial cause:** Python libraries are not copied to system library directories in Mac installs. And no `-Lpath` compiler option is used for compiling \"run\".\n\n**The root cause:** The distutils python package is currently being erroneously used to grab the C/C++ library information. In fact, distutils is currently returning the location of libraries to _import_ into python scripts. It's a coincidence that the real library name has the same name `python3.4`. Therefore, since it wasn't designed for it, distutils can't be used to the find the library's location...\n\n**Recommendation:** We use the python configuration tool to tell us the exact linker arguments instead: (e.g., with `python$(VERSION)-config --ldflags`). While we are at it, we could grab the cflags with `--cflags` as well. This way we are always using the appropriate flags that the Python package builders meant for us to use when linking against Python. \n\n**Drawbacks:** This solution works with the Homebrew Python 3.4 installation on Mac OS X. However, I have observed the ldflags can sometimes contain extra -lfile libs that are not currently included in our build system, which can then lead to a similar error. This was observed with the MacPorts installation.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4982","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507242346","x-github-request-id":"9B94:572A:6D1ED9:F57C4A:59D6A39C","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/14095175/issues?state=all&page=19>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/14095175/issues?state=all&page=31>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/14095175/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/14095175/issues?state=all&page=17>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"6e256f9361229e8ff481fa00f1a75d10\"","status":"200 OK"}}
