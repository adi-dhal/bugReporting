The lang code is then passed through [this langcode map](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/blob/master/openage/convert/hardcoded/langcodes_hd.py) to convert to a longer language code that's compatible with the output of an AoC 1.0c language file conversion.\r\n\r\nHowever, the langcode_hd map uses \"normal\" strings and not byte strings, so trying to access the `b'en'` property fails.
