of all thanks a ton for this project. I've been lurking this git for a while now but haven't really tried it out until now.\r\n\r\nBecause I recently switched back to Windows purely for the better graphical driver support, I also gave WSL a try. WSL is the Windows Subsystem for Linux. It's actually Microsoft's attempt at merging Ubuntu and Windows, and I must say they have been very successful so far. \r\n\r\nBecause openage doesn't have any Windows support yet, I wanted to try it on WSL. WSL comes with Ubuntu 14.04 as of now. 14.04 doesn't have too many of the requirements for compiling openage, so I decided to upgrade to 16.04. After the update and some other tweaks and small hacks, I was able to compile openage using gcc. Everything went successful and I even was able to run the asset conversion script on my Steam HD installtion without any errors.\r\n\r\nWSL doesn't support any hardware devices, which is why I'm stuck now. It's possible to install an X server on Windows and get multiple GUI tools working, but there isn't really a way to do this with audio. I tried to look if pulseaudio works, and it does, but openage seems to not be using it.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>I'm currently stuck on the following output...</summary>\r\n<pre>\r\nINFO launching engine with data directory './assets' and fps limit 0\r\n^C\r\nINFO SDL audio subsystems initialized\r\n^C\r\nALSA lib confmisc.c:768:(parse_card) cannot find card '0'\r\nALSA lib conf.c:4292:(_snd_config_evaluate) function snd_func_card_driver returned error: No such file or directory\r\nALSA lib confmisc.c:392:(snd_func_concat) error evaluating strings\r\nALSA lib conf.c:4292:(_snd_config_evaluate) function snd_func_concat returned error: No such file or directory\r\nALSA lib confmisc.c:1251:(snd_func_refer) error evaluating name\r\nALSA lib conf.c:4292:(_snd_config_evaluate) function snd_func_refer returned error: No such file or directory\r\nALSA lib conf.c:4771:(snd_config_expand) Evaluate error: No such file or directory\r\nALSA lib pcm.c:2266:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM default\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"run.py\", line 15, in init run (/mnt/d/Games/openage/run.cpp:1043)\r\n    main()\r\n  File \"/mnt/d/Games/openage/openage/__main__.py\", line 94, in main\r\n    return args.entrypoint(args, cli.error)\r\n  File \"/mnt/d/Games/openage/openage/game/main.py\", line 47, in main\r\n    return run_game(args, assets)\r\n  File \"openage/game/main_cpp.pyx\", line 26, in openage.game.main_cpp.run_game (/mnt/d/Games/openage/openage/game/main_cpp.cpp:1143)\r\n    result = run_game_cpp(args_cpp)\r\n  File \"\", line 0, in\r\n  File \"\", line 0, in openage::run_game(openage::main_arguments const&)+0x239\r\n  File \"\", line 0, in openage::Engine::create(openage::util::Dir*, int, bool, char const*)+0x5b\r\n  File \"\", line 0, in openage::Engine::Engine(openage::util::Dir*, int, bool, char const*)+0x3d3\r\n  File \"\", line 0, in openage::audio::AudioManager::AudioManager()+0x38\r\n  File \"\", line 0, in openage::audio::AudioManager::AudioManager(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&)+0x1569\r\n  File \"\", line 0, in openage::error::Error::Error(openage::log::message const&, bool, bool)+0x185\r\n  File \"\", line 0, in openage::error::StackAnalyzer::analyze()+0x9f\r\n  File \"libopenage/audio/audio_manager.cpp\", line 57, in openage::audio::AudioManager::AudioManager(const string&)\r\n    throw Error{MSG(err) << \"Error opening audio device: \" << SDL_GetError()};\r\nopenage.cppinterface.exctranslate.CPPException: Error opening audio device: ALSA: Couldn't open audio device: No such file or directory\r\nError in sys.excepthook:\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/apport_python_hook.py\", line 47, in apport_excepthook\r\n    try:\r\nKeyboardInterrupt\r\n\r\nOriginal exception was:\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"run.py\", line 15, in init run (/mnt/d/Games/openage/run.cpp:1043)\r\n    main()\r\n  File \"/mnt/d/Games/openage/openage/__main__.py\", line 94, in main\r\n    return args.entrypoint(args, cli.error)\r\n  File \"/mnt/d/Games/openage/openage/game/main.py\", line 47, in main\r\n    return run_game(args, assets)\r\n  File \"openage/game/main_cpp.pyx\", line 26, in openage.game.main_cpp.run_game (/mnt/d/Games/openage/openage/game/main_cpp.cpp:1143)\r\n    result = run_game_cpp(args_cpp)\r\n  File \"\", line 0, in\r\n  File \"\", line 0, in openage::run_game(openage::main_arguments const&)+0x239\r\n  File \"\", line 0, in openage::Engine::create(openage::util::Dir*, int, bool, char const*)+0x5b\r\n  File \"\", line 0, in openage::Engine::Engine(openage::util::Dir*, int, bool, char const*)+0x3d3\r\n  File \"\", line 0, in openage::audio::AudioManager::AudioManager()+0x38\r\n  File \"\", line 0, in openage::audio::AudioManager::AudioManager(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&)+0x1569\r\n  File \"\", line 0, in openage::error::Error::Error(openage::log::message const&, bool, bool)+0x185\r\n  File \"\", line 0, in openage::error::StackAnalyzer::analyze()+0x9f\r\n  File \"libopenage/audio/audio_manager.cpp\", line 57, in openage::audio::AudioManager::AudioManager(const string&)\r\n    throw Error{MSG(err) << \"Error opening audio device: \" << SDL_GetError()};\r\nopenage.cppinterface.exctranslate.CPPException: Error opening audio device: ALSA: Couldn't open audio device: No such file or directory\r\n</pre>\r\n</details>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\nAlthough this is the most important afaik:\r\n\r\n```\r\nALSA lib confmisc.c:768:(parse_card) cannot find card '0'\r\nopenage.cppinterface.exctranslate.CPPException: Error opening audio device: ALSA: Couldn't open audio device: No such file or directory\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think that what I'm asking here is to make it so an audio device is not required to start the game, but I'd love to hear any sort of discussion regarding this. WSL is obviously not a priority, but it seems that this would also be present in Linux, although I can't confirm that.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the amazing project.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/653","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/653/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/653/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/653/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/issues/653","id":185749082,"number":653,"title":"Trouble building on Mac","user":{"login":"shobhitg","id":440151,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/440151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shobhitg","html_url":"https://github.com/shobhitg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shobhitg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shobhitg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shobhitg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shobhitg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shobhitg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shobhitg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shobhitg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shobhitg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shobhitg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":64037878,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true},{"id":142055767,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/labels/buildsystem","name":"buildsystem","color":"eb6420","default":false},{"id":142053505,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/labels/mac%20os","name":"mac os","color":"ff35e5","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2016-10-27T18:44:31Z","updated_at":"2016-12-31T17:30:22Z","closed_at":"2016-12-31T17:30:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I am trying to build this on Mac.

Combining a simple test framework with the history / log discussed in [Chipmunk's pull request](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/pull/642) this could enable powerful regression testing as well in the future.\n\nFor example, in some silly pseudocode, maybe testing wood gathering could look like this:\n\n```\n# test_wood_gatherer_log.txt:\n- tick 0: load TestArabia.map\n- tick 0: spawn villager at (1,1) with id 0\n- tick 1: task unit with id 0 to chop wood at (1,2)\n- tick 1000: end\n\n# test.py\nimport headless_engine\nheadless_engine.run(open('test_wood_gatherer_log.txt'))\nassert headless_engine.get(unit=0)['carrying']['wood'] == 10\n```\n\nPerhaps this is already possible. If so, can someone point me in the right direction for doing so? \n\n(This is a bit of a stupid reason / test compared to the architectural advantages of a headless mode, but I only develop on Linux over SSH (my local machine cannot effectively run it) and I'd love to be able to contribute without having access to Linux with a graphical environment. Except for the rendering pipeline, everything should be workable like that it seems.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/652/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/651","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/651/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/651/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/651/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/issues/651","id":184623054,"number":651,"title":"Split the hitpoints attribute","user":{"login":"MaanooAk","id":6997990,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6997990?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaanooAk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaanooAk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaanooAk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaanooAk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaanooAk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaanooAk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaanooAk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaanooAk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaanooAk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaanooAk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaanooAk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":142245448,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/labels/c++","name":"c++","color":"000000","default":false},{"id":64037882,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/labels/question","name":"question","color":"cc317c","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-10-22T10:33:07Z","updated_at":"2017-02-06T23:09:27Z","closed_at":"2017-02-06T23:09:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The one attribute must be shared and have the max hp (and possibly the size of the health bar)\nThe other attribute not shared and have the current hp\n\nI am happy to implement it, but I need suggestions for the names of the two attributes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/651/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/650","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/650/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/650/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/650/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/issues/650","id":184591329,"number":650,"title":"Building destruction physics","user":{"login":"TheJJ","id":673543,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/673543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ","html_url":"https://github.com/TheJJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":142245448,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/labels/c++","name":"c++","color":"000000","default":false},{"id":198543598,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/labels/just%20do%20it","name":"just do it","color":"3fe5bf","default":false},{"id":142056555,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/labels/nice%20new%20thing%20%E2%98%BA","name":"nice new thing ☺","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2016-10-21T23:31:39Z","updated_at":"2016-11-06T18:17:56Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"[![castle destruction](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/AfraidBriefGibbon-poster.jpg)](https://gfycat.com/AfraidBriefGibbon)\n\nOur buildings should be fully destructible.
