Layouters or designers can then use this information to draft a GUI, e.g. for #728 .\r\n\r\nThe options we have to enumerate (as suggested by @coffenbacher) are:\r\n\r\n- [x] Game Settings\r\n    - [x] all useful settings available up through the latest UP / Voobly / HD \r\n    - [x] any settings we see demand for that aren't even in UP but will highly likely be in OpenAge\r\n    - [x] any settings for any highly likely OpenAge-specific features\r\n- [x] Multiplayer Game Options\r\n    - [x] all useful settings available up through the latest UP / Voobly / HD \r\n    - [x] any settings we see demand for that aren't even in UP but will highly likely be in OpenAge\r\n    - [x] any settings for any highly likely OpenAge-specific features\r\n\r\nAdditionally it would be nice, if we could sort all entries into categories.\r\n\r\nInspiration can also be drawn from other (RTS-)games with nice and highly configurable interfaces like DoTA2.\r\n\r\nFeel free to suggest any options/entries/categories/nice-to-have-features in the comments.

crashes in multiprocessing mode when there are compiled cython modules in the tree (despite explicitly ignoring those modules). We have to fall back to single-process mode in this case.\r\nOtherwise, this speeds up the style checker by about 10 seconds. Would be pretty nice for kevin builds.\r\nAlso fixed a bug where you could not run the codecompliance module in textfile only mode.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/710","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/710/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/710/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/710/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/issues/710","id":201835672,"number":710,"title":"Blacklist ASDF in the compliance checker as invalid","user":{"login":"TheJJ","id":673543,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/673543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ","html_url":"https://github.com/TheJJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheJJ/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":175825064,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/labels/easy","name":"easy","color":"ccee20","default":false},{"id":198543598,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/labels/just%20do%20it","name":"just do it","color":"3fe5bf","default":false},{"id":142056555,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/labels/nice%20new%20thing%20%E2%98%BA","name":"nice new thing ☺","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":142245512,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/labels/python","name":"python","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":13,"created_at":"2017-01-19T11:36:46Z","updated_at":"2017-04-08T20:50:45Z","closed_at":"2017-04-08T20:50:44Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"@mic-e and I started to write `ASDF` or `asdf` in the code to denote things that must be changed before the pull request is merged.
