issue #588 (and those before them), I tried to fix building and running openage on OS X. I failed, but maybe some of what I found out may be useful.\n\nBuilding actually works by including\n\n``` Objective-C\n<AppKit/AppKit.h>\n```\n\nand replacing line 17 with\n\n``` Objective-C\nNSOpenGLContext *current_context = [NSOpenGLContext currentContext];\n```\n\nNo magic there. I'll submit a pull request soon.\n\nThe runtime problems are a lot worse. In gui_renderer_impl.cpp \n\n``` C++\nQWindow *w = QWindow::fromWinId(id);\n```\n\nnow actually retrieves a valid handle to the window, but using it in line 112:\n\n``` C++\nthis->ctx->makeCurrent(this->render_control->renderWindow(nullptr))\n```\n\n(could be written as)\n\n``` C++\nQWindow *window = this->render_control->renderWindow(nullptr);\nthis->ctx->makeCurrent(window)\n```\n\nmakeCurrent will dramatically fail, the engine won't stop printing stack traces.\nThe somewhat opaque QOpenGLContext seems to be a different class at runtime corresponding to the platform. On my OS X machine, it's actually a QCocoaGLContext, which wraps the native NSOpenGLContext.\n\nNow, looking at the source code of [QCocoaGLContext.mm:](http://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtbase.git/tree/src/plugins/platforms/cocoa/qcocoaglcontext.mm)\n\n``` Objective-C++\nbool QCocoaGLContext::makeCurrent(QPlatformSurface *surface)\n{\n    Q_ASSERT(surface->surface()->supportsOpenGL());\n\n    QMacAutoReleasePool pool;\n\n    QWindow *window = static_cast<QCocoaWindow *>(surface)->window();\n    setActiveWindow(window);\n\n    [m_context makeCurrentContext];\n    update();\n    return true;\n}\n\nvoid QCocoaGLContext::setActiveWindow(QWindow *window)\n{\n    if (window == m_currentWindow.data())\n        return;\n\n    if (m_currentWindow && m_currentWindow.data()->handle())\n        static_cast<QCocoaWindow *>(m_currentWindow.data()->handle())->setCurrentContext(0);\n\n    Q_ASSERT(window->handle());\n\n    m_currentWindow = window;\n\n    QCocoaWindow *cocoaWindow = static_cast<QCocoaWindow *>(window->handle());\n    cocoaWindow->setCurrentContext(this);\n\n    [(QNSView *) cocoaWindow->contentView() setQCocoaGLContext:this];\n}\n```\n\nwe see that the GLContext tries to cast the QWindow to QCocoaWindow, retrieve a QNSView which wraps the internal NSView and call a method on it with itself as an argument.\nSince `contentView()` returns the internal NSView (the window is of type `Qt::Window | Qt::ForeignWindow`, which, looking at [QCocoaWindow's constructor](http://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtbase.git/tree/src/plugins/platforms/cocoa/qcocoawindow.mm), prevents the NSView from being wrapped in a QNSView), calling `setQCocoaGLContext` will fail, as there is no such method.\n\nBy the way, implementing a stub method on the class will make the game actually launch (Objective-C supports extending existing classes), but it will stay at black screen, and losing and regaining focus will make it crash, so it seems necessary for the QCocoaGLContext to actually receive a QCocoaWindow containing a QNSView.\n\nAs far as I can see, it's neither intended nor easy to use the internal Qt classes like QCocoaWindow or QNSView, which would be what the QCocoaGLContext expects. Even if there were access, I'm not sure wrapping an existing, foreign NSView will actually work, even more so with the OpenGL stuff around it.\n\nThat's as far as I could get. I hope porting this game to other platforms is not out of scope, but I think with the current design, this won't get far on OS X.\n## <bountysource-plugin>\n\nWant to back this issue? **[Post a bounty
