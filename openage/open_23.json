mfw Terminal Terminal Terminal\n\nthis is a somewhat dirty branch on which i'm testing cross compiling on linux to mingw-w64 :dancer:\n\nbased on mappu's work on #9 and former work at #207. also [this unnamed branch similar to mappu's guide](https://github.com/franciscod/openage/tree/a4519112381fe7dd8ceed3377d620dc548064d07) \n\n---\n## Prerequisites\n- You can build and run openage on your native platform without issues\n- You have Wine and mingw-w64 installed plus all the dependencies in their mingw crosscompiled form [example: AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?K=mingw-w64))\n## The four super hard steps to see gaben under wine\n\n```\n$ ./buildsystem/mingw-configure    # generates config.h, we're not using cmake yet\n$ ./buildsystem/mingw-build-simple # compiles\n$ ./buildsystem/mingw-deploy       # copies .exe and dlls\n$ ./buildsystem/mingw-run-wine     # calls wine with fontconfig settings\n```\n\n---\n## Issues (need help!)\n- [x] compile with a simple build script based on `buildsystem/simple` (`buildsystem/mingw-build-simple`)\n- [x] fix the fontconfig slow loading at startup\n- [ ] improve the random fontconfig solution (see the `buildsystem/mingw-run-wine` envvar)\n- [ ] integrate cleanly with cmake instead of breaking `configure`\n- [ ] find a way to package it for bare windows7 (xp? vista?) 32bit (with dlls and every dep needed)\n- [ ] fix skewed gaben texture\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/233/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/232","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/232/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/232/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/232/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/pull/232","id":57494274,"number":232,"title":"Foreach
