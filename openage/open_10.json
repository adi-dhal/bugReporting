Since I was unable to find any screenshots, video, releases or status documentation since 2015, and wanted to find out what the project looks like today.\n\nThere were 4 problems so far. I have solutions for three of them.\n## Problem 1: [configure] `Qt5Core` package configuration not found\n\n```\nCall Stack (most recent call first):\n  CMakeLists.txt:88 (doxygen_configure)\n\n\n\ncpp library\n    libopenage                                          [212 sources] [15 generated]\nCMake Error at libopenage/CMakeLists.txt:90 (find_package):\n  By not providing \"FindQt5Core.cmake\" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has\n  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by \"Qt5Core\", but\n  CMake did not find one.\n\n  Could not find a package configuration file provided by \"Qt5Core\"\n  (requested version 5.4) with any of the following names:\n\n    Qt5CoreConfig.cmake\n    qt5core-config.cmake\n\n  Add the installation prefix of \"Qt5Core\" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set\n  \"Qt5Core_DIR\" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If\n  \"Qt5Core\" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has\n  been installed.\n```\n\nQt5 provides in its `lib/cmake` directory (i.e. `/usr/local/Cellar/qt5/5.6.2/lib/cmake`) some `cmake` scripts (e.g. `Qt5CoreConfig.cmake`). Our `cmake` needs to find these, since they tell it how to link against Qt5's modules (e.g. `Qt5::Core`).\n#### Solution\n\nBefore running `./configure`, I set the following variable in my shell:\n\n``` bash\nCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=\"$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:/usr/local/Cellar/qt5/5.6.2/lib/cmake\"\n```\n#### Another solution\n\nThere is an alternative solution I found that for some reason works.\n\nThat is: add `/usr/local/opt/qt5/bin` to your `$PATH`.\n\nI think I remember that this turned out to be only a partial solution. However it's possible my memory is failing me, and that the \"remaining problem\" with it was simply Problem 3 (which is a problem we encounter with either of the solutions).\n## Problem 2: [make] `GL/gl.h` not found\n\n```\n➜  openage git:(master) 🍔 make\n…\n[  1%] Building CXX object libopenage/CMakeFiles/libopenage.dir/engine.cpp.o\nIn file included from /Users/birch/git/openage/libopenage/engine.cpp:17:\nIn file included from /Users/birch/git/openage/libopenage/gui_basic.h:12:\n/Users/birch/git/openage/libopenage/gui/guisys/public/gui_renderer.h:7:10: fatal error: 'GL/gl.h' file not found\n#include <GL/gl.h>\n         ^\n1 error generated.\n```\n\nApparently the OpenGL headers on Mac live under `OpenGL/gl.h`.\n#### Solution\n\nI helped it find the headers by changing `openage/libopenage/gui/guisys/public/gui_renderer.h`:\n\n``` diff\n+#ifndef __APPLE__\n #include <GL/gl.h>\n+#else\n+#include <OpenGL/gl.h>\n+#endif\n```\n## Problem 3 [make]: `QCocoaNativeContext` not found\n\n```\n[ 34%] Building CXX object libopenage/CMakeFiles/libopenage.dir/gui/guisys/private/platforms/context_extraction_cocoa.mm.o\n/Users/birch/git/openage/libopenage/gui/guisys/private/platforms/context_extraction_cocoa.mm:7:10: fatal error: \n      'QtPlatformHeaders/QCocoaNativeContext' file not found\n#include <QtPlatformHeaders/QCocoaNativeContext>\n         ^\n1 error generated.\n```\n\nSo, it needs more includes. I used `make VERBOSE=1` to check what includes we were already recruiting:\n\n``` bash\n[ 34%] Building CXX object libopenage/CMakeFiles/libopenage.dir/gui/guisys/private/platforms/context_extraction_cocoa.mm.o\ncd /Users/birch/git/openage/.bin/clang++-3-5-debug-Oauto-sanitize-none/libopenage && /usr/local/bin/clang++-3.5   -DQT_CORE_LIB -DQT_GUI_LIB -DQT_NETWORK_LIB -DQT_QML_LIB -DQT_QUICK_LIB -Dlibopenage_EXPORTS -I/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Headers -I/usr/local/include/freetype2 -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/include/opus -I/Users/birch/Library/Frameworks/SDL2.framework/Headers -I/Library/Frameworks/SDL2_image.framework/Headers -iframework /usr/local/Cellar/qt5/5.6.2/lib -isystem /usr/local/Cellar/qt5/5.6.2/lib/QtCore.framework/Headers -isystem /usr/local/Cellar/qt5/5.6.2/./mkspecs/macx-clang -isystem /usr/local/Cellar/qt5/5.6.2/lib/QtQuick.framework/Headers -isystem /usr/local/Cellar/qt5/5.6.2/lib/QtGui.framework/Headers -isystem /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Headers -isystem /usr/local/Cellar/qt5/5.6.2/lib/QtQml.framework/Headers -isystem /usr/local/Cellar/qt5/5.6.2/lib/QtNetwork.framework/Headers  -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Wno-mismatched-tags -stdlib=libc++ -std=c++14 -g -O1 -fPIC   -F/Users/birch/Library/Frameworks  -fPIC -std=gnu++14 -o CMakeFiles/libopenage.dir/gui/guisys/private/platforms/context_extraction_cocoa.mm.o -c /Users/birch/git/openage/libopenage/gui/guisys/private/platforms/context_extraction_cocoa.mm\n```\n\nSo, we already have quite a few Qt header directories included. Such as the `Qt5::Core` module's headers, in the directory: `/usr/local/Cellar/qt5/5.6.2/lib/QtCore.framework/Headers`.\n\nI noticed that Qt provide _no_ `QtPlatformHeaders.framework` module. So we will have to use a different strategy here.\n#### Solution:\n\nI added to the `libopenage`'s `CMakeLists.txt`\n\n``` diff\n+if(APPLE)\n+   set(QTPLATFORM_INCLUDE_DIRS \"/usr/local/Cellar/qt5/5.6.2/include\")\n+endif()\n\n# directories for header inclusion\ninclude_directories(\n    ${OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR}\n    ${FREETYPE_INCLUDE_DIRS}\n    ${EPOXY_INCLUDE_DIRS}\n    ${OPUS_INCLUDE_DIRS}\n    ${SDL2_INCLUDE_DIR}\n    ${SDL2IMAGE_INCLUDE_DIRS}\n    ${HarfBuzz_INCLUDE_DIRS}\n+   ${QTPLATFORM_INCLUDE_DIRS}\n)\n```\n\nSadly this is hardcoding. Maybe there is a better way. It certainly had the desired effect: `clang` was able to find the `QtPlatformHeaders/QCocoaNativeContext` headers.\n### Problem 4 [make]: clang gets very confused trying to read OS X `Foundation`'s `NSObject` header\n\nI am not sure what's going on here.\n\n```\n[ 34%] Building CXX object libopenage/CMakeFiles/libopenage.dir/gui/guisys/private/platforms/context_extraction_cocoa.mm.o\nIn file included from /Users/birch/git/openage/libopenage/gui/guisys/private/platforms/context_extraction_cocoa.mm:7:\nIn file included from /usr/local/Cellar/qt5/5.6.2/include/QtPlatformHeaders/QCocoaNativeContext:1:\nIn file included from /usr/local/Cellar/qt5/5.6.2/include/QtPlatformHeaders/qcocoanativecontext.h:38:\nIn file included from /System/Library/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Headers/NSOpenGL.h:9:\nIn file included from /System/Library/Frameworks/Foundation.framework/Headers/Foundation.h:10:\nIn file included from /System/Library/Frameworks/Foundation.framework/Headers/NSArray.h:5:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/Foundation.framework/Headers/NSObject.h:19:21: error: expected a type\n- (id)copyWithZone:(nullable NSZone *)zone;\n                    ^\n/System/Library/Frameworks/Foundation.framework/Headers/NSObject.h:25:28: error: expected a type\n- (id)mutableCopyWithZone:(nullable NSZone *)zone;\n                           ^\n/System/Library/Frameworks/Foundation.framework/Headers/NSObject.h:32:4: error: expected a type\n- (nullable instancetype)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aDecoder;

So maybe it was expecting C++, but encountered Objective-C, and exploded? But at the same time: it is aware of Objective-C, as evidenced by the message:\n\n> expected selector for Objective-C method\n\nSo, I don't really get what happened. Anyway, I thought I may as well report my findings.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/643/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/642","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/642/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/642/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/642/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/pull/642","id":183278134,"number":642,"title":"[WIP] History and interpolation","user":{"login":"ChipmunkV","id":5393579,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5393579?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChipmunkV","html_url":"https://github.com/ChipmunkV","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChipmunkV/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChipmunkV/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChipmunkV/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChipmunkV/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChipmunkV/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChipmunkV/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChipmunkV/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChipmunkV/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChipmunkV/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":142245448,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/labels/c++","name":"c++","color":"000000","default":false},{"id":338226073,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/labels/network","name":"network","color":"f0da44","default":false},{"id":142056555,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/labels/nice%20new%20thing%20%E2%98%BA","name":"nice new thing ☺","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-10-16T17:10:52Z","updated_at":"2017-04-06T12:51:09Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/pulls/642","html_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/pull/642","diff_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/pull/642.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/pull/642.patch"},"body":"The current game logic will be mostly used in the server. Same code will probably be used on the client to predict the outcome of the commands issued by the player.\r\n\r\nThe outcomes of all commands of all of the players form a history. The history is generated by the server.\r\n\r\nThis PR starts from an in-memory representation of the history (it's not about network). The goals are:\r\n- [x] modify attributes, so they can record changes\r\n- [x] position is not an `Attribute`, so capture changes inside the constructor and actions\r\n- [x] write out the history while the client is running (currently it has all the server code)\r\n- [ ] write out the history of object creation\r\n\r\n*no server-side prediction/correction for the moment\r\n\r\n*no special format\r\n- [ ] replay that history on the client\r\n- [ ] output the history with server-side predictions and corrections (move away from recording every change of an attribute)\r\n- [ ] replay the history that contains corrections\r\n\r\nIntegration is probably going to be via `Unit::action_secondary`, `UnitContainer::new_unit` and `Unit::delete_unit`. The idea is to create one `CurveAction` that will sit forever in the `Unit::action_secondary` and apply all curves on each graphical tick.\r\n\r\nTo extract changes, the members of `Attribute<T>` can be transformed into \"spying\" values. It's enough for point-curves, but things like `MoveAction` will eventually need to generate longer curves.\r\n\r\nAt the end of each logic tick (maybe I should call it a network tick) the history will be resynchronized and a segment from it will be used to show the next tick. Pipelining will be needed. The network frame rate is flexible because in theory it's inversely proportional to the amount of stuff that is coming.\r\n\r\nRelated - #530.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/642/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/641","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/641/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/641/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFTtech/openage/issues/641/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/pull/641","id":183205450,"number":641,"title":"inform
