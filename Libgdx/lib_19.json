If you do setPixel with a color that doesn't have full alpha, it changes all the other color values. If you do getPixel you will get a different color than what you originally wanted.\nThis is really bugging me right now, because I wanted to save the colors (that I get by getPixel) in json and then load the json and get the same color. However, what happens is that the colors get darker and darker the more i load and save.\n#### Reproduction steps/code\n\n```\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.ApplicationAdapter;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.Gdx;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.backends.lwjgl.LwjglApplication;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.Pixmap;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.Pixmap.Format;\n\npublic class PixmapColor extends ApplicationAdapter {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        new LwjglApplication(new PixmapColor());\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void create() {\n        Pixmap pixmap = new Pixmap(64, 64, Format.RGBA8888);\n        int color = 0xff0000dd; // red that is a bit transparent\n\n        // Prints ff0000dd\n        Gdx.app.log(\"PixmapColor\", Integer.toHexString(color));\n\n        pixmap.drawPixel(0, 0, color);\n\n        // Prints wrong color: dd0000dd\n        Gdx.app.log(\"PixmapColor\", Integer.toHexString(pixmap.getPixel(0, 0)));\n\n        pixmap.dispose();\n    }\n\n}\n```\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\n\n1.9.2\n#### Stacktrace\n\nNone\n#### Please select the affected platforms\n- [x] Android\n- [x] iOS (robovm)\n- [x] iOS (MOE)\n- [x] HTML/GWT\n- [x] Windows\n- [x] Linux\n- [x] MacOS\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4363","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4363/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4363/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4363/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4363","id":182643174,"number":4363,"title":"Back button on android not being catched by Gdx.input.isKeyJustPressed()","user":{"login":"Betalord","id":22757675,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22757675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Betalord","html_url":"https://github.com/Betalord","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Betalord/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Betalord/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Betalord/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Betalord/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Betalord/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Betalord/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Betalord/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Betalord/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Betalord/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":172870364,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/need%20more%20info","name":"need more info","color":"bfdadc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-10-12T21:49:58Z","updated_at":"2016-12-17T21:10:53Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"As I said in the description of this issue, the back button on android device is not being catched by Gdx.input.isKeyJustPressed().

Adds a new `FilterableVehicleRaycaster` C/C++ class to the custom Bullet wrapper classes and a generated Java class by adding it to the `dynamics.i` interface file.\n\nIncludes a test/demo called `VehicleFilterTest` which extends the existing `VehicleTest`.\n\nThe wrapper code compiles on the Linux and Android platform (Windows and OSX is untested). In order to compile for Android we had to run the `BulletBuild.java` program, which regenerated a file called `Android.mk`. Presumably the automated build system will do this, otherwise we can add it to the PR.\n\nThe demo has been tested on desktop, but we were unable to test on Android because of problems when packaging the Bullet libraries. Neither has it been tested on the other platforms.

Issue details\n\nOne of my users has [reported an error](https://github.com/raeleus/skin-composer/issues/11) under Ubuntu Linux when running any LibGDX app using the LWJGL3 backend: `libEGL warning: failed to create a pipe screen for i965` I can't reproduce the issue under Ubuntu or Linux Mint, so I imagine it is specific to Intel processors or his particular hardware setup. The Window decorations render, however the game screen does not display and instead shows something of a snapshot of what was underneath the window. He's tested with a basic app that only renders a skin and it still reproduces the issue.\n\nAfter doing some research, I found the following documented LWJGL3 issue: https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3/issues/205 which sounds exactly like what this user was experiencing. The page speaks of a fix or partial workaround. Can this be applied to LibGDX? Thanks for your time.\n#### Reproduction steps/code\n\nAny project that implements the LWJGL3 backend and run under Ubuntu Linux on certain hardware configurations.

You end up with an error message when trying to do a Gradle Sync or to build and run the Android project from within the IDE.\n\nIn both Android Studio and IntelliJ IDEA, you get the following error:\n\n``` java\nError:(23, 1) A problem occurred evaluating project ':tests:gdx-tests-android'.\n> Failed to apply plugin [id 'com.android.application']\n   > Your project contains 2 or more modules with the same identification com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-box2d\nat \":extensions:gdx-box2d\" and \":extensions:gdx-box2d:gdx-box2d\".\nYou must use different identification (either name or group) for each modules.\n```\n\nThat part is easy enough to fix. All you need to do is to rename the parent \"module\".  I have already done this part in commit 50179d2a870c1c938d5a0c5014b9c0a09fc3c4d7 on my fork. Up until a few days ago it was enough to get the code to Sync and Run nicely in the IDE. (I even submitted PR #4316 to that effect.)\n\nUnfortunately, with the refactoring of the Gradle build (0ea025084f59d8feb7711f825bf0f11c440830bd) the Gradle Sync and Instant Run within the IDE are no longer working even with this fix.\n\nWe're now left with the following error:\n\n``` java\nError:(18, 1) A problem occurred evaluating project ':tests:gdx-tests'.\n> Could not find method compile() for arguments [project ':gdx'] on object of type org.gradle.api.internal.artifacts.dsl.dependencies.DefaultDependencyHandler.\n```\n\nInterestingly, the command-line Grade build and installDebug do work without a hitch. It would appear that the Android plugin get confused with the dependencies. Manually adding `apply plugin: \"java\"` to the `gradle.build` file of `:tests:gdx-tests` will allow the build to proceed further but even when adding it to all the related modules, other errors crop up further along so it's not a viable solution and I had to admit defeat due to my limited knowledge of Gradle.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4341/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4340","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4340/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4340/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4340/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4340","id":180488949,"number":4340,"title":"[backend-lwjgl3]
