It will be in the upper left corner of the map.\nAdd a tile object from your tileset.  The map starts at 0,1.\nI tried building the latest nightly of Tiled from GIT, the issue is still there.  \n\nHowever, what is the most elegant way to deal with with LibGDX?\nx and y are added to the Object properties.  This issue only occurs with Tiled map objects that are \"tile\" based, where they have an image.  This uses the \"gid\" attribute in XML for Tiled.\n  <object type=\"com.cookwithkevin.game.enemy.GreenSlime\" gid=\"1025\" x=\"482\" y=\"1330\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\"/>\n\nSo, a programmer, if gid is exposed, now has a way to deal with this.  They can offset the object up 1 tile.  \n\nThis should be a harmless change to support it.  Additionally, this gives the flexibility to assign an image to a Tiled map object based on GID instead of doing something else, if someone wanted to.\n\nIf this is inappropriate, setting a property manually on such an object is a workaround, ie, \"hasYCoordBug\" or something similar.   \n\nThe underlying issue is that there's no way to determine once you load a map with TMXMapLoader what is a \"rect\" and what is a \"tile\" based object.  This gives a way, if it has a gid, it's a \"tile\" based object.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/430/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/429","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/429/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/429/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/429/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/429","id":14811874,"number":429,"title":"Add

this pull request adds an Ant Task for the Atlas Builder with the following features ;\n- Ant Task\n- define sprites from a bigger images (i.e. one source file can contain more than one sprite) with different resolution support (i.e. scaling coordinates),\n- include font in atlas\n- extends font with custom sprite\n- specify hot points for sprites\n- use different padding for sprites of the same atlas\n- use custom filtering durring generation (for hover effect, preparing for linear filtering,...)\n- merging of last pages of differents packs\n\nHere is an example of an ant file using it ;\n\n`````` XML\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\n<project name=\"explorers-assets\" basedir=\".\" default=\"assets\">\n    <taskdef name=\"buildatlas\"

This can be seen when  scaling down the texture with linear filtering ; blending will be performed using black pixels for the 0 alpha pixel instead of the initial color.\n\nThis modification use direct ARGB copy to preserve color when alpha is 0, leading to correct filtering.\n\nI performed some testing comparing results between the current implementation and this one, not finding unexpected changes. There are some situations where the current implementation will behave \"strangely\" (at least, I don't fully understand), like using rotation, different padding on X and Y axis with non even padding, all of this in the same time. Not sure of the use case of this type of situation ; anyway, the result with this implementation should be satisfying as well.\n\nI have read the sticky post from the forum (http://www.badlogicgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=635) and I think this is different.  \nThis change will only help if you produce sprite with color over fully transparent area (like in this post : http://www.badlogicgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=635&p=27934)\n\nEdit : sorry, I made it wrong with git.
