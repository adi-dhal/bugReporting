Background\n\nOur project SleepFighter https://github.com/Hasselmannen/sleepfighter\nis an alarm app for android that uses mini-games (\"Challenge\") that needs OpenGL/libgdx\nfor some Challenges - others use MathML.\nWe've an activity that spawns these games (ChallengeActivity): https://github.com/Hasselmannen/sleepfighter/blob/master/application/src/se/toxbee/sleepfighter/activity/ChallengeActivity.java\nThe interface for a Challenge is: https://github.com/Hasselmannen/sleepfighter/blob/master/application/src/se/toxbee/sleepfighter/challenge/Challenge.java\n\nSince all challenges don't use libgdx, it is unacceptable for ChallengeActivity to extend AndroidApplication.\nI'd rather send in the ChallengeActivity to AndroidApplication.\n## Changes\n\nSince alot of projects rely on AndroidApplication being an activity.\nI haven't changed that mechanism, but rather I moved the code in AndroidApplication to AndroidApplicationBackend and let AndroidApplication still be an activity but delegate to AndroidApplicationBackend.\n\nAvoiding inheritance for these cases is sound OOD \n\nI don't know any other way to solve this.\nThis solution allows for complete backwards compatibility.\n\nI agree that the use case might be rare - but the performance impact of the changes should be slim to nill since people shouldn't call getGraphics(), and such methods in loops but rather store the value of such a call in a local field.\n\nI sent a mail signing the CLA btw

The issue I found was that if I use scale() on the Group, the image is not drawn into the screen.\n\nToying a little more I think I found the issue, and it is on the draw() method in the Group class. Inside applyTransform() is setting the transformation matrix of the batch again, and later in resetTransform() it is restored again. Shouldn't the transform matrix be scaled up on down, but using the same instance? To prove my theory I extended the Group class and it works. This is my code:\n\n```\npublic class MyGroup extends Group {\n\n    @Override\n    public void draw(SpriteBatch batch, float parentAlpha) {\n        // Instead of using super.draw(batch, parentAlpha);\n\n        float scaleX = getScaleX();\n        float scaleY = getScaleY();\n        float scaleZ = 0;\n        float rotation = getRotation();\n\n        // Instead of if (transform) applyTransform(batch, computeTransform());\n        if (isTransform()) {\n            batch.getTransformMatrix().scale(scaleX, scaleY, scaleZ);\n            // Do in some way... batch.getTransformMatrix().rotate(rotation);\n        }\n\n        // This is original\n        drawChildren(batch, parentAlpha);\n\n        // Instead of if (transform) resetTransform(batch);\n        if (isTransform()) {\n            batch.getTransformMatrix().scale(-scaleX, -scaleY, -scaleZ);\n            // Do in some way... batch.getTransformMatrix().rotate(-rotation);\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\nPS: Looking more into it I saw that using scale() in Group actually has no purpose, because the boundaries of the Group don't prevent the children to be drawn outside, but I guess this is a bug anyways. Shouldn't the children be drawn only inside the Group boundaries and be clipped if anything is drawn outside?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/939/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/938","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/938/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/938/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/938/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/938","id":22388335,"number":938,"title":"Added Triangle class and updated Intersector and ShapeRenderer","user":{"login":"vanniktech","id":5759366,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5759366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanniktech","html_url":"https://github.com/vanniktech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanniktech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanniktech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanniktech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanniktech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanniktech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanniktech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanniktech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanniktech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanniktech/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":18,"created_at":"2013-11-09T16:00:12Z","updated_at":"2014-06-20T12:01:36Z","closed_at":"2013-12-01T15:16:06Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/938","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/938","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/938.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/938.patch"},"body":"I added a Triangle class, which encapsulates a 2D Triangle defined by it's three points (A, B and C).\nShapeRenderer and Intersector now also support the Triangle class.
