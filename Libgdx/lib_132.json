have an issue with the ui.\nIn fact, i create a Table, a dialog and a stage.

It is null so the dialog does not call correctly keepInStage() private function of the Window.class file.\n\nHere is my code: \n\n```\nthis.stage = new Stage();\n\n        this.layout = new Table(skin);\n        this.layout.setFillParent(true);\n\n        this.stage.addActor(layout);\n\n        //NinePatch patch = skin.getPatch(\"default-round\");\n        Label label = new Label(\"Un probleme est survenue durant le chargement de la carte !\", skin);\n        TextButton button = new TextButton(\"Ok\", skin);\n\n        this.dialog = new Dialog(\"Alerte\", skin);\n        this.dialog.setKeepWithinStage(true);\n        this.dialog.padLeft(10).add(label).padRight(15);\n        this.dialog.row();\n        this.dialog.add(button).colspan(2);\n        //this.dialog.setModal(true);\n\n        button.addListener(new ClickListener(){\n\n            @Override\n            public void clicked (InputEvent event, float x, float y) {\n                stage.clear();\n\n                System.out.println(\"STAGE: \" + dialog.getStage() + \" == \" + stage);\n                System.out.println(\"OK\");\n                //Gdx.input.setInputProcessor(stage);\n            }\n\n        });\n\n        this.layout.add(this.dialog);\n        Gdx.input.setInputProcessor(stage);\n\nSystem.out.println(\"STAGE: \" + this.dialog.getStage() + \" == \" + stage);\n```\n\nI hope you ll solve this problem soon :/\nMay this error coming from me, but i don't think.\n\nThanks,\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/952/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/951","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/951/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/951/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/951/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/951","id":22423769,"number":951,"title":"Add setX and setY to TextureAtlas.AtlasSprite so that it matches expected whitespace behavior.","user":{"login":"mbforbes","id":1170062,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1170062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbforbes","html_url":"https://github.com/mbforbes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbforbes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbforbes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbforbes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbforbes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbforbes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbforbes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbforbes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbforbes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbforbes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2013-11-11T01:56:31Z","updated_at":"2014-07-01T20:57:17Z","closed_at":"2013-11-11T09:01:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/951","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/951","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/951.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/951.patch"},"body":"Currently the getters and setPosition have been overridden, but the setters still behave like normal sprites, which means the whitespace behavior of the AtlasSprite is screwed up when you use a setter.
