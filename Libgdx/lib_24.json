been using this in my project for a while and it has saved me a lot of time. This lets you set the SplitPane to respect the min size of the widgets in it, so the handle cannot shrink either inner widget to the point of cropping it. This is a lot easier than trying to manually calculate the split amount limits and also allows it to layout properly when you want this functionality.\n\nI considered using prefSizes instead, but I think going down that path would make it ambiguous in usage. What I mean is, SplitPane crops widgets that are drawn smaller than their min sizes, so that's what we want to prevent. You can wrap it in a container if it doesn't already have a min size, or you want to use the pref size as a min size. Since the inner widgets are often Tables, this is usually not a concern anyway.\n\nAs far as I know, the only place where this might modify existing projects is where I started counting the min size of the handle drawable in the `getMinWidth` and `getMinHeight` methods.

Problem comes when application closes. In `LwjglCanvas#dispose()` of my class I'm trying to release some OpenGL related resources (like `Textures` inside `AssetManager`) and get this pretty self explained exception:\n\n```\nException in thread \"AWT-EventQueue-0\" java.lang.RuntimeException: No OpenGL context found in the current thread.\n    at org.lwjgl.opengl.GLContext.getCapabilities(GLContext.java:124)\n    at org.lwjgl.opengl.GL11.glDeleteTextures(GL11.java:732)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.backends.lwjgl.LwjglGL20.glDeleteTexture(LwjglGL20.java:248)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.GLTexture.delete(GLTexture.java:170)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.Texture.dispose(Texture.java:198)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.assets.AssetManager.unload(AssetManager.java:211)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.assets.AssetManager.clear(AssetManager.java:653)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.assets.AssetManager.dispose(AssetManager.java:621)\n    ...\n```\n\nMy investigation brought me to `LwjglCanvas#stop()` method. Look at the lines order:\n\n```\n    public void stop () {\n        EventQueue.invokeLater(new Runnable() {\n            public void run () {\n                if (!running) return;\n                running = false;\n                try {\n                    Display.destroy();\n                    if (audio != null) audio.dispose();\n                } catch (Throwable ignored) {\n                }\n                Array<LifecycleListener> listeners = lifecycleListeners;\n                synchronized (listeners) {\n                    for (LifecycleListener listener : listeners) {\n                        listener.pause();\n                        listener.dispose();\n                    }\n                }\n                listener.pause();\n                listener.dispose();\n            }\n        });\n    }\n```\n\nAs you can see `Display.destroy()` called before `listener.pause()` and `listener.dispose()` methods, and that causes the issue. This line order looks strange even because kinda similar class `LwjglApplication#stop()` calls `Display.destroy()` after listener's methods and everything fine back there. So I consider this is just an old problem that requires simple lines swap. If I'm wrong and here is a reason behind that specific order, it would be good to know and discuss solution.\n#### Reproduction steps/code\n\nPlease check out this commit AurelienRibon/libgdx-texturepacker-gui@b0d2d0d393b888ca7a3f9ce19e41354c75972338. Simply run the application using Gradle `./gradlew app:run` and terminate it by clicking X button of the window. See the log output. Exception will be thrown by `aurelienribon.texturepackergui.canvas.Canvas#dispose()` method.\n\n_UPD: just use code in my comment below_\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\n\n1.9.3\n#### Please select the affected platforms\n- [x] Windows\n- [x] Linux\n- [x] MacOS\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4202","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4202/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4202/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4202/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4202","id":167112219,"number":4202,"title":"Hiero creates fnt file without any space delimiting the fields for higher Unicode blocks","user":{"login":"CreamyCookie","id":3063858,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3063858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CreamyCookie","html_url":"https://github.com/CreamyCookie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CreamyCookie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CreamyCookie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CreamyCookie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CreamyCookie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CreamyCookie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CreamyCookie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CreamyCookie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CreamyCookie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CreamyCookie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-07-22T19:10:32Z","updated_at":"2016-08-07T00:54:38Z","closed_at":"2016-08-07T00:54:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"#### Issue details\n\nHiero creates a file where for Unicode characters with high codepoints there's no space delimiting the `ìd` and `x` attribute.

If you touch on the screen again, it's now pointer 1, because 0 has been locked as always down.(and you can repeat it, locking all touchpoints) \n#### Reproduction steps/code\n\nSteps Overview:\n1) Create a new LibGDX roboVM project\n2) Get the project setup to display an Admob interstitial ad\n3) Have an ad appear while touching the screen\n4) (remove your finger) Close the ad, the input will still be counted as being held down- any new inputs will be the next pointer\n5) repeat until all 10 fingers are counted as being down while not touching the screen\n\nSteps More in depth:\n1) Create a new LibGDX roboVM project\n2) Add everything to be able to display admob ads from the updated robopods:\n    a) In the build.gradle for the project, in the buildscript->dependiencies, change the mobidevelop class path to version '2.2.0-SNAPSHOT'\n    b) In the allprojects->ect section, change the roboVMVersion to '2.2.0-SNAPSHOT', and add 'robopodsVersion' with the same version\n    c) Add to the ios dependencies: compile \"com.mobidevelop.robovm:robopods-google-mobile-ads-ios:$robopodsVersion\"\n    d) Download the Admob iOS library, and put the 'GoogleMobileAds.framework' into a new folder in the iOS project called 'libs'\n    e) In robovm.xml in the iOS project add:\n\n``` java\n<frameworkPaths>\n    <path>libs</path>\n  </frameworkPaths>\n   <frameworks>\n    <framework>GoogleMobileAds</framework>\n    <framework>UIKit</framework>\n    <framework>OpenGLES</framework>\n    <framework>QuartzCore</framework>\n    <framework>CoreGraphics</framework>\n    <framework>OpenAL</framework>\n    <framework>AudioToolbox</framework>\n    <framework>AVFoundation</framework>\n    <framework>SafariServices</framework>\n    <framework>CoreBluetooth</framework>\n    <framework>AdSupport</framework>\n    <framework>AudioToolbox</framework>\n    <framework>AVFoundation</framework>\n    <framework>CoreGraphics</framework>\n    <framework>CoreData</framework>\n

<framework>MessageUI</framework>\n    <framework>QuartzCore</framework>\n    <framework>StoreKit</framework>\n    <framework>SystemConfiguration</framework>\n  </frameworks>\n```\n\n  3) Create a new Interface in your core project to call the interstitial from:\n\n``` java\n\npublic interface AdTest\n{\n    public void Update(float deltaTime);\n    public void RequestAd();\n}\n```\n\n4) Call the AdTest.Update function from your Game render loop:\n\n``` java\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.ApplicationAdapter;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.Gdx;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.GL20;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.Texture;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g2d.SpriteBatch;\n\npublic class Game extends ApplicationAdapter\n{\n    SpriteBatch batch;\n    Texture img;\n    AdTest test;\n\n    public Game()\n    {\n\n    }\n\n    public Game(AdTest test)\n    {\n        this.test=test;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void create ()\n    {\n        batch = new SpriteBatch();\n        img = new Texture(\"badlogic.jpg\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void render ()\n    {\n        Gdx.gl.glClearColor(1, 0, 0, 1);\n        Gdx.gl.glClear(GL20.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);\n        batch.begin();\n        batch.draw(img, 0, 0);\n        batch.end();\n\n        test.Update(Gdx.graphics.getDeltaTime());\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void dispose ()\n    {\n        batch.dispose();\n        img.dispose();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n5) Create your Ad interface in your iOS project\n\n``` java\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.Gdx;\nimport org.robovm.apple.uikit.UIApplication;\nimport org.robovm.apple.uikit.UIViewController;\nimport org.robovm.pods.google.mobileads.GADInterstitial;\nimport org.robovm.pods.google.mobileads.GADRequest;\npublic class AdTestIOS implements AdTest\n{\n    GADInterstitial adInterstitial;\n\n    float ad_display_timer =0;\n    final float ad_display_delay =10;\n\n    float log_timer=0;\n    final float log_delay=1;\n\n    public AdTestIOS()\n    {\n        RequestAd();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void RequestAd()\n    {\n        GADRequest request = new GADRequest();\n        request.setTestDevices(java.util.Arrays.asList(GADRequest.getSimulatorID()));\n        adInterstitial = new GADInterstitial(\"ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/4411468910\");\n        adInterstitial.loadRequest(request);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void Update(float deltaTime)\n    {\n        ad_display_timer +=deltaTime;\n        if(ad_display_timer > ad_display_delay)\n        {\n            ad_display_timer =0;\n            if (adInterstitial.isReady())\n            {\n                UIViewController viewController = UIApplication.getSharedApplication().getKeyWindow().getRootViewController();\n                adInterstitial.present(viewController);\n                RequestAd();\n            }\n        }\n        UpdateUI(deltaTime);\n    }\n\n    public void UpdateUI(float deltaTime)\n    {\n        log_timer+=deltaTime;\n        if(log_timer>log_delay)\n        {\n            log_timer=0;\n            Gdx.app.log(\"AdTestIOS\", \"Press and hold the screen until ad appears in \" + ((int) (ad_display_delay - ad_display_timer)) +\n                    \"s. isTouched(0)=\" + Gdx.input.isTouched(0) + \": \\\"+. isTouched(1)= \"+ Gdx.input.isTouched(1));\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n6) Pass your iOS interface to the Game when starting up the IOSLauncher:\n\n``` java\nimport org.robovm.apple.foundation.NSAutoreleasePool;\nimport org.robovm.apple.uikit.UIApplication;\n\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.backends.iosrobovm.IOSApplication;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.backends.iosrobovm.IOSApplicationConfiguration;\n\npublic class IOSLauncher extends IOSApplication.Delegate \n{\n    @Override\n    protected IOSApplication createApplication() \n    {\n        IOSApplicationConfiguration config = new IOSApplicationConfiguration();\n        return new IOSApplication(new Game(new AdTestIOS()), config);\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[]
