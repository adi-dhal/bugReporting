In my workflow I found it cumbersome to produce many png files for an animation, many of which were repeated to get the pauses necessary in certain animations. But apps like GIMP and Cosmigo Pro Motion can very easily produce animated gifs with variable length time delays, and the single file helps keep a version control directory from getting cluttered.\n\nTo allow for varied time delays per frame, a float version of a GCD is calculated, and frames of animation are repeated (aliased) to get timings that match the original gif. The GCD delay is output to console, and is the value that when used in the Animation constructor, will result in an Animation with timings that match the original gif. The float GCD algorithm requires some maximum allowable time error, so I added a setting for `maxAnimationDelayError`. This is the permissible variation in delay (in seconds) for each frame. Usually, the result will be significantly more accurate than the error. If the error setting is set to 0, then this step is skipped and no frames are repeated.\n\nMaybe down the road we could consider expanding the pack format to provide animation delay information, but that would also require a new Animation type that supports variable delay. But I think in most cases, it would be more performant to use Animation as is with extra frames in its array of TextureRegions, so I think this GCD delay is a good solution. Gifs can be intentionally generated with a certain GCD in mind to minimize the number of frames that are generated.\n\nI had to do a bit of a refactor for empty images to allow animations with empty frames. I figure that empty frames in an animation are not a mistake, and must be kept as timing placeholders, so for gifs only, the `ignoreBlankImages` setting is ignored. Also, the `useIndices` setting is ignored for gifs, since there can be no animation without indices.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2591/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2590","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2590/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2590/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2590/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2590","id":48932671,"number":2590,"title":"IOS/RoboVM, ScreenUtils , empty texture when multisampling enabled","user":{"login":"yncki","id":1530496,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1530496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yncki","html_url":"https://github.com/yncki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yncki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yncki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yncki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yncki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yncki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yncki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yncki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yncki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yncki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336980,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true},{"id":59604199,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/ios","name":"ios","color":"207de5","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-11-15T21:06:40Z","updated_at":"2017-09-06T21:17:10Z","closed_at":"2017-09-06T21:17:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It seems that readPixels, takes pixel data from wrong framebuffer resulting in empty pixels in screenshots when multisampling.

Maybe just one class shared among the backends, or maybe we can put it in the core code without touching the backends?\n\nAccording to Apple, glGetError() may degrade performance so we would probably want a developer-mode switch.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2585/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2584","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2584/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2584/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2584/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2584","id":48729404,"number":2584,"title":"GWT Export does not Prevent Default Key Presses","user":{"login":"Deathsbreed","id":6626993,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6626993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deathsbreed","html_url":"https://github.com/Deathsbreed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deathsbreed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deathsbreed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deathsbreed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deathsbreed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deathsbreed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deathsbreed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deathsbreed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deathsbreed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deathsbreed/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336982,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2014-11-14T04:30:05Z","updated_at":"2015-08-24T14:54:47Z","closed_at":"2014-11-30T17:03:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"When I compile my libGDX project to target `html` there are scripts to prevent default mouse operations, but not keyboard.

since ContactListener is a Java-C++ bridge, connecting C++ static methods, it's impossible to have multiple functioning instances of them. Only one gets triggered, only one gets processed. Trying to enable (by overriding) different methods of the same kind triggers the expected behaviour - it raises an exception. Yet creating multiple ContactListener instances doesn't issue any kind of exception nor warning - it just silently overrides the settings of all the CL's other than the last one called.\n\nWhat can be done about it? Some ideas off the top of my head:\n1. in CL's constructor, detect if the static callback has been already set and either raise an exception or issue a warning, something along the lines of e.g. throw new GdxRuntimeException( \"Only one ContactListener instance can be enabled at any given time. dispose() or disable() the previous one before creating another.\" ); or Gdx.app.error( \"Only one ContactListener instance can be enabled at any given time. The prevously active instance has been disabled. dispose() or disable() the previous one before creating another to stop this error from being logged.\" );\n2. require an explicit .enable() call after creating new CL,\n3. clearly document existing behaviour in JavaDoc.\n\nI'm aware that one may intentionally try to instantiate a new CL to \"disable\" the old one and \"enable\" a new one at the same time, but since a) this results in the old one being essentially inactive, b) it's also virtually impossible to track which one is active ATM, and c) the class is essentially undocumented, I suppose that at least some of the time (if not most) when this happens is just by pure accident. In current implementation/documentation state, it's completely unobvious that the CL's setting is static indeed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2566/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4921","x-ratelimit-reset":"1506844633","x-github-request-id":"9E2C:110A:2489E4D:40D22A2:59D09595","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=79>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=164>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=77>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"bf8d9bffc81c8e508d1a658eec03c1a5\"","status":"200 OK"}}
