merge #3432 and other relevant issues to this:\n\nAfter testing with padded and not-padded fonts it is clear that padding is bugged.\n\nTested with the built-in: data\\arial-32.fnt and data\\arial-32-pad.fnt for contrast (and to eliminate issues with my personal assets that I wrongly uploaded in #3432).\n\nThe top pair of draws are the padded font, the second pair has no padding and is displayed correctly.\n\nIf the last glyphrun ended with a space, the location to start the new glyphrun (for the next colored text section) doesn't compute the correct offset taking into account pad left & pad right.\n\nThe same happens when closing a tag since a new run starts with the previous color.\n\nEdit: Note that it's not about glyphs or spaces at all, the text from the next run has wrong offset and overlaps the previous text and the total width of the text element is incorrect.\n\nEdit 2: Note how the 4rth line is also different than the 3d this is a seperate and maybe a linked issue since it's not affected by font padding.\n\n![output](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8305672/10265004/6bb0d220-6a27-11e5-83e9-162a964d3107.png)\n\nApplication class:\n\n```

It is my opinion that it should also feature a wrapper that supports the creation of basic scripts, either using a unique language or a language that already exists. I would be willing to write some of the code for this, but before I commit to thousands of lines of coding I would like to get an idea of how many people would use this.\n\nMany great game engines and frameworks use scripting languages to avoid the need to recompile games when making changes. It is, as a matter of fact, [recommended to use a scripting language](http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/2913/why-do-we-use-scripts-in-development/2914#2914) for large projects. While most libgdx projects are small, some can be pretty big. For example, I was compiling my game to test it and it took fifteen minutes to complete. This is annoying, and I toyed around with the concept of creating my own scripting language, but the idea of debugging 2000+ more lines of code by myself was daunting.  It seems better and more efficient to break the work up between multiple devs than to try and accomplish such a task alone.\n\nI want to keep with the reusable and extendable tradition of libgdx and have drafted the following (rough) graph of how the engine could work;\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10172349/10140923/7483b158-65cf-11e5-9cbd-802deb7aa736.jpg)\n\nThe Parser would be an interface to handle the syntax of the script while the Interpreter (an abstract class and the real meat) would handle expressions and logic. The java implementation would, of course, be custom implementations of the interfaces which tie together into a controlling class which can be instantiated in your create method and implemented in your render method.\n\nWould this fit well with the main project? Should I add it to the main project?  Any ideas on how to implement it?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3444/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3443","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3443/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3443/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3443/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3443","id":108625580,"number":3443,"title":"Graphics crash with java 8","user":{"login":"Frontrider","id":6755034,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6755034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frontrider","html_url":"https://github.com/Frontrider","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frontrider/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frontrider/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frontrider/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frontrider/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frontrider/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frontrider/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frontrider/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frontrider/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frontrider/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-09-28T09:59:26Z","updated_at":"2015-09-28T10:09:21Z","closed_at":"2015-09-28T10:09:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I found a report on java's bug tracker, whitch pointed me to report it here.\nI tought that is the current temporary video card (an old one), but its crashing for other people too.\n\nDowngrading to java7 for now.\n\nhttp://pastebin.com/hHpKqnTi\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3443/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3442","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3442/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3442/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3442/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3442","id":108551447,"number":3442,"title":"Hiero does not support GPOS kerning","user":{"login":"ttencate","id":90930,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/90930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttencate","html_url":"https://github.com/ttencate","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttencate/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttencate/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttencate/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttencate/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttencate/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttencate/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttencate/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttencate/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttencate/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-09-27T18:10:06Z","updated_at":"2015-10-05T19:02:17Z","closed_at":"2015-10-05T19:02:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Apparently the font I'm using (Fredoka One, [available for download here](http://www.1001freefonts.com/fredoka_one.font)) doesn't have any kerning data in the `kern` table, but it does in the [more advanced `GPOS` (glyph positioning) table](https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/GPOS.htm), which Hiero doesn't seem to support.\n\nI might have a shot at adding such support, but maybe somebody knows of a workaround?
