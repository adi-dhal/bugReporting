Then I can only change the image to some size that has the same aspect ratio as the original one like 50 \\* 50 or 60 \\* 60.Its not possible to set it to 40 \\* 50 or 50 \\* 80. If I set a size with a different aspect ratio, it just produces blanket space around according to the specific ratio.For instance, if I set it to 40_50,then it will produce 10 pixels space vertically while not change the width.

change \n\n``` json\n     // note how this is #toString() \n    \"releaseType\": \"nightly\",\n```\n\nfor the ReleaseType#name() as following:\n\n``` json\n    // note how this is #name()\n    \"releaseType\": \"NIGHTLY\",\n```\n\nthe parsing is done correctly.\n#### Possible solution?\n\nSince we have a ton of files parsed as the one shown above, my question is if it's possible to allow the user to choose between the usage of Enum#name() or Enum#toString() depending on a boolean flag inside Json.java class. This solution would also add some flexilibity to the class since the users could decide what values to use when working with .json files.\n\nBtw we're using the leatest nightlies because in the previous versions the JsonReader.java didn't work correctly with comments and we needed some of the features added after the 1.0.0 stable release.\n\nThankyou for you time.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2447","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2447/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2447/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2447/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2447","id":45443797,"number":2447,"title":"Update text while drawing BitmapFont make text \"broken\" (not smooth anymoar)","user":{"login":"tr4788","id":5146176,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5146176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tr4788","html_url":"https://github.com/tr4788","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tr4788/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tr4788/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tr4788/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tr4788/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tr4788/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tr4788/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tr4788/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tr4788/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tr4788/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-10-10T03:47:48Z","updated_at":"2014-10-10T09:46:03Z","closed_at":"2014-10-10T09:33:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi guys.\n\nI use this code to load BitmapFont:\n\n```\nFreeTypeFontLoaderParameter loadingParams = new FreeTypeFontLoaderParameter();\nloadingParams.fontFileName = \"fonts/segoeui.ttf\";\nloadingParams.fontParameters.size = 48;\nAssets.inst().load(\"loading.ttf\", BitmapFont.class, loadingParams);\n```\n\nAfter that, i render it by this:\n\n```\nTextBounds tb = Assets.inst().get(\"loading.ttf\", BitmapFont.class).getBounds(message);\nAssets.inst().get(\"loading.ttf\", BitmapFont.class).draw(Global.sprite_batch, message, Global.screenW / 2 - tb.width / 2, 100);\n```\n\nIn the begening, `message` = \"Loading...\" and everything is ok.

It just uses a hidden TextView element with the input type TEXT. The key inputs are then routed to the AndroidInput as usual.\n\nSecond commit is about password mode of TextFields. If the font of a text field does not contain the defined (or default) password character, it will currently just write plain text.
