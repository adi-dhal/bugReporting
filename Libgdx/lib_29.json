If so I think this is a design flaw since it is very easy to oversee an unchecked exception. Maybe at least put this to the description of the handleHttpResponse() method to warn users about this problem.\n\nIt took me quite a while to figure out a bug I had in my code.\n\nIs this good and supposed to be like it is or do we need to rewrite the class above?

code:\n\n```\n@Override\n    public void didBecomeActive(UIApplication application) {\n        super.didBecomeActive(application);\n        FBSDKAppEvents.activateApp();\n        Gdx.app.getApplicationListener().render();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void willResignActive(UIApplication application) {\n        super.willResignActive(application);\n        Gdx.app.getApplicationListener().pause();\n        Gdx.gl.glFlush();\n        application\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void willTerminate(UIApplication application) {\n        super.willTerminate(application);\n        Gdx.app.debug(\"IOSApplication\", \"disposed\");\n        Gdx.gl.glFlush();\n        Gdx.app.getApplicationListener().dispose();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void didEnterBackground(UIApplication application) {\n        super.didEnterBackground(application);\n        Gdx.gl.glFlush();\n        Gdx.app.log(\"did\", \"ENTER BACKGROUND\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void willEnterForeground(UIApplication application) {\n        super.willEnterForeground(application);\n        Gdx.app.log(\"WILL ENTER FOREGROUND\", \"\");\n        Gdx.app.getApplicationListener().resume();\n    }\n```\n\nThe strange thing is that even the messages are not shown in my tab, so these methods are never even called. \n\nGoogling the issue I found that many have encountered the same problem, however, I have spent about 2 weeks trying to find a solution and I still have not found it + my RoboVM license is ending in a couple of days......
