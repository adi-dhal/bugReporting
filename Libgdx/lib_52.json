Tested in libgdx 1.6.5 on OS X 10.10.5.\n\nThe basic idea is that when using color markup in scene2d labels, the character immediately following the \"pop color\" control code, `[]`, either doesn't have its width set correctly, or is not offset the correct amount from the character before the control code. The problem isn't confined to fonts with fixed width glyphs specified, but it does help illustrate it better.\n\nThe above code run with the call to `font.setFixedWidthGlyphs` commented out: Small but noticeable difference. This difference is more pronounced on monospace fonts (even with no fixed width glyphs specified).\n\n<img width=\"512\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6292811/9505635/d7a791a0-4c43-11e5-8a89-7370ac17af11.png\">\n\nWith the call uncommented:\n<img width=\"512\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6292811/9505672/132425a4-4c44-11e5-8e87-616fde909d74.png\">\n\nNote:\n1. How more pronounced the effect is the more `[]` controls are in the string, and\n2. The amount of space between the last 't' and the first period on each line.\n\nThis may or may not be related to #3239, but my hunch is it's a different subtle bug somewhere else in the glyph width calculation :-)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3377","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3377/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3377/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3377/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3377","id":103342324,"number":3377,"title":"uiskin in json format is wrong and should be in double qoutes","user":{"login":"Wisienkas","id":3602087,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3602087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wisienkas","html_url":"https://github.com/Wisienkas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wisienkas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wisienkas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wisienkas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wisienkas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wisienkas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wisienkas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wisienkas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wisienkas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wisienkas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2015-08-26T19:02:10Z","updated_at":"2015-08-26T22:57:17Z","closed_at":"2015-08-26T19:04:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3376","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3376/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3376/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3376/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3376","id":103305172,"number":3376,"title":"Field#getElementType differs under GWT","user":{"login":"antag99","id":7714919,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7714919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antag99","html_url":"https://github.com/antag99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antag99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antag99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antag99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antag99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antag99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antag99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antag99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antag99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antag99/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-08-26T15:58:06Z","updated_at":"2015-09-28T13:17:26Z","closed_at":"2015-09-28T13:17:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"`Field#getElementType()` differs under GWT when faced with wildcards; on the desktop it returns `null`, under GWT it returns a non-null value (probably `java.lang.Object.class`).

just stumbled over this issue:\nhttp://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/106120/stopping-actor-tap-click-event-from-propagating\n\nI believe this might be a bug in `Stage`. Looking at its `touchUp` handler (or any of the other handlers), it doesn't appear to stop events from propagating when listeners handle it, since it makes no attempt to break out of the loop if `Event#isHandled()` is true:\nhttps://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/2bd1557bc293cb8c2348374771aad832befbe26f/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/scenes/scene2d/Stage.java#L348\n\nThis means that it's impossible to receive click events in actors and swallow them in order to prevent them from triggering other game behavior in response to taps on the stage.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3368/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3367","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3367/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3367/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3367/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/3367","id":102525395,"number":3367,"title":"Fix

I want to remove the first `n` elements of an array; what I currently have to do is this:\n\n``` java\nif (n > 0)\n    array.removeRange(0, n - 1);\n```\n\nIf it weren't from the `n > 0` check, I would get an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` saying `start can't be > end` for the case where `n` is `0`. This seems quite problematic API-wise.\n\nI think it's better to have `end` exclusive, but that requires a nasty breaking change. An idea is to make `removeRange` do nothing for the case where `start > end`.
