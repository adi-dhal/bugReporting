likely users want to work with pure Kotlin source files or as much as they can when they selected to use Kotlin for project in gdx-setup.\r\n\r\nNotable changes are\r\n* Add kotlin template files for all launcher classes, and core's main class. These are for project generation to use.\r\n* Checking is based on `Language` for its `JAVA` and `KOTLIN`, and for HTML target, also check `gwtSupported` flag.\r\n* Change kotlin version to `1.1.3` instead of `1.1.1` as there should be no major reason to hang back and use older version of kotlin.\r\n\r\n**PS**. Actually there's 1 single commit that relevant to this changes. But due to I update my forked repo to latest libgdx after my [previous PR](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4741) gets merged.

```asFloatBuffer()```, because the buffer is not a ```GL_FLOAT```.\r\n\r\nI guess just passing ```buffer``` instead of ```byteBuffer``` in

Issue details\r\nlibGDX provides a great way for the developers to implement their own file resolvers and loaders. Unfortunately, there are parts of the libGDX code itself that does not support these yet. The Skin class is one of those. Basically, you cannot use the Skin class along with JSON files based skins if you have defined a custom FileHandleResolver because the Skin class code won't rely on it. \r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\nI think all the involved code is within this method of the Skin class:\r\n\r\n`protected Json getJsonLoader (final FileHandle skinFile)`\r\n\r\nThere are several file resolutions there that can be modified to rely on the FileHandleResolver approach and thus be made compatible with custom resolvers, just to pick the first one:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nFileHandle fontFile = skinFile.parent().child(path);\r\nif (!fontFile.exists()) fontFile = Gdx.files.internal(path);\r\nif (!fontFile.exists()) throw new SerializationException(\"Font file not found: \" + fontFile); \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should be better written as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFileHandle fontFile = resolver(path);\r\nif (!fontFile.exists()) throw new SerializationException(\"Font file not found: \" + fontFile); \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would require some additional changes in the Skin class to have such resolver available. At least a way to provide the the resolver. It could be as easy as add this parameter to some of its constructors, much as it is done in the AssetManager class, for example:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n/** Creates a new AssetManager with all default loaders. */\r\n\tpublic AssetManager (FileHandleResolver resolver) {\r\n\r\n/** Creates a new AssetManager with optionally all default loaders. If you don't add the default loaders then you do have to\r\n\t * manually add the loaders you need, including any loaders they might depend on.\r\n\t * @param defaultLoaders whether to add the default loaders */\r\n\tpublic AssetManager (FileHandleResolver resolver, boolean defaultLoaders) {\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt should be a matter of extrapolating that approach to the Skin class itself.\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\n1.9.3 and probably every other version \r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\n- [X] Android\r\n- [X] iOS (robovm)\r\n- [X] iOS (MOE)\r\n- [X] HTML/GWT\r\n- [X] Windows\r\n- [X] Linux\r\n- [X] MacOS\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4807/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4806","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4806/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4806/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4806/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4806","id":239966335,"number":4806,"title":"maven deployment","user":{"login":"jjYBdx4IL","id":491220,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/491220?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjYBdx4IL","html_url":"https://github.com/jjYBdx4IL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjYBdx4IL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjYBdx4IL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjYBdx4IL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjYBdx4IL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjYBdx4IL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjYBdx4IL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjYBdx4IL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjYBdx4IL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjYBdx4IL/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-07-01T18:53:53Z","updated_at":"2017-07-01T19:10:15Z","closed_at":"2017-07-01T19:10:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Just read the two years old article about the maven deployment that is still not finished.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to rebuild stuff using maven just to deploy it to maven central.

So if anyone succeed to import a map on android studio, I need help :/ \r\n```java\r\nmapLoader = new TmxMapLoader();\r\n        map = mapLoader.load(\"map-finale.tmx\");\r\n        MapProperties prop = map.getProperties();\r\n        int mapWidth = prop.get(\"width\", Integer.class);\r\n        int mapHeight = prop.get(\"height\", Integer.class);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code seems works well tho...\r\n\r\n#### Issue details\r\nImport a .tmx map on Android Studio\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\nlast one\r\n\r\n#### Stacktrace\r\n```java\r\nError:Error: Unsupported type 'tileset'\r\nError:Error: Unsupported type 'layer'\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\n- [X] Android\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4801/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4800","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4800/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4800/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4800/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4800","id":239196818,"number":4800,"title":"Wrong xAdvance for labels when using markdown","user":{"login":"dkarchnak","id":16850838,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/16850838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkarchnak","html_url":"https://github.com/dkarchnak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkarchnak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkarchnak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkarchnak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkarchnak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkarchnak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkarchnak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkarchnak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkarchnak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkarchnak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-06-28T15:08:47Z","updated_at":"2017-06-28T15:29:12Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"#### Issue details\r\nWhen using labels with markdown, xAdvance for GlyphLayout.GlyphRun is not calculated correctly, which results in unwanted spaces in the text.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\nThe easiest way to reproduce this issue is by slightly changing BitmapFontTest.\r\nAdd following code to BitmapFontTest.create() method and compare 2 newly added labels.\r\n\r\n```\r\nlabelToCompareA = new Label(\"This is a Test Label, to see if color markdown affects labels in any unwanted way!\", skin);\r\nlabelToCompareB = new Label(\"This is a [GREEN]Test Label[], to see if color markdown affects labels in any unwanted way!\", skin);\r\n\t\t\r\nlabelToCompareA.setPosition(100, 350);\r\nlabelToCompareB.setPosition(100, 380);\r\n\t\t\r\nlabelToCompareA.debug();\r\nlabelToCompareB.debug();\r\n\t\t\r\nstage.addActor(labelToCompareA);\r\nstage.addActor(labelToCompareB);\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Screenshot of the issue\r\n![labels](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16850838/27644664-6a3ae804-5c24-11e7-820b-6fa39f99c9f1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\nCurrent master branch is affected by this issue.

Reading back this data with UBJsonReader will result in a \"Unrecognized data type, string expected\" error though that is not the actual problem and leaves the user without any hint of what has gone wrong. The underlying problem is that the default state ('oldFormat' field set to 'true') of UBJsonReader treats short values as integers and thus over-reads data which leads to the parse() function breaking. This can be seen if only a short[] is written using UBJsonWriter; trying to read it back leads to an EOFException unless 'oldFormat' is set to false. To solve this mismatch between UBJsonWriter and UBJsonReader perhaps there can be a 'useOldFormat' boolean in the UBJsonWriter constructor that, if set to true (defaults to true?), internally converts and writes Shorts as Ints? This would prevent the error and it would alert a user of the two classes of this inter-dependency. This is, of course, only a suggestion without knowing all the background of what went into the code being this way; whatever lets users know what's going on here is the idea. Just trying to save someone else hours of debugging ;) Thanks for your time.\r\n\r\n***Update Edit*** - so it turns out that if 'oldFormat = false' then UBJsonReader parse() breaks when trying to read in a .g3db file from FBX-Conv so I guess there is inter-library dependency on this 'oldFormat' field. Below is the new code to see this and attached here is the .g3db file [boneTest.zip](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/files/1111827/boneTest.zip) I used (it was generated from a Blender file of a cube and two bones).\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\n```\r\npublic class UBJsonReadWriteTest implements ApplicationListener {\r\n\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic void create ()
