I suspect it is a case sensitivity error, but I can't be sure. Regardless, it is a problem, and I have absolutely no idea how to fix this, and after half an hour of Googling the problem and trying out solutions, including cleaning + rebuilding the project, I have been unable to fix this problem. I'm using Intellij IDEA, if that helps.\n#### Reproduction steps/code\n\nI haven't seen this anywhere else, but all I do to recreate this is create a new project using the gradle install, and follow the demo as to how you create a new game.
