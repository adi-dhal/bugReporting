off, wanted to say that I'm a big fan of libgdx library and Beginning Android Games. Awesome job building a kick ass game development platform. Although I have about 5 years of professional Java experience, I'm quite new to the game development arena. The book and the library allowed me to easily jump head first into creating my first game.\n\nOn to the request:\n\nI saw a blog post from a couple of years ago (http://www.badlogicgames.com/wordpress/?p=1951) where @badlogic mentioned that he was not planning to integrate Artemis into libgdx, but rather roll his own Entity Management System. I was wondering if any progress has been made on that front.\n\nI have recently started to work on porting Artemis to use libgdx for containers and pooling. The repo is here: https://github.com/apotapov/gdx-artemis. It's in very early stages. There's still a ton of work to do.\n\nWould there be any interest in adding this Artemis port as a libgdx extension?

The change is not fully complete (need to add light attributes), but most API changes are included and I don't want to bloat the PR.\n- Separate DefaultShaderProvider and add GLES10ShaderProvider, there's no need to check if gles 20 is available on every call.\n- Add DefaultShader.Config, so the DefaultShader isn't bloated with arguments anymore.\n- Separate the Attribute class from the Material class\n- Add Attributes class which is basically a set of Attribute instances\n- Make Material extends Attributes so it only adds an ID\n- Rename Lights to Environment and make it extend Attributes\n- Make TextureDescriptor generic (T extends GLTexture), restrict TextureAttribute to Texture\n- Add CubemapAttribute\n- Various other changes\n\nThe idea behind this change is that an Attribute (e.g. ColorAttribute) can be set to either the Material and Environment (if the attribute is present in both, the Material will be used). This simplifies shaders (just a bunch of attributes to match with uniforms) and makes environment much more flexible (e.g. add ColorAttribute.Fog to add fog etc.).\n\nThere is a downside to this change, e.g. one could add ColorAttribute.Diffuse to the environment (causing all models without a diffuse color to be using that diffuse color). So there is no distinction between material attributes and environment attributes, which might be hard to understand if you're new to the concept. However, it also allows you to \"bake\" environment attributes onto a model, which I think is justifying this change.\n\nNote that the shader separately receives both material and environment (and the combined attributes if it extends BaseShader), so a shader can still distinct material and environment attributes.\n\nAnother downside might be that the number of attributes is limited to the number of bits in long. But I don't expect that's going to be a problem atm.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/775/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/774","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/774/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/774/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/774/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/774","id":20211245,"number":774,"title":"[RoboVM]
