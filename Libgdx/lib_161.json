spending a few days researching the various IAP services (GooglePlay, iOS, Amazon, Intel AppUp, Apple Mac Store), here is my proposal for addition of a platform-independent IAP system to libgdx. Not sure where it would be added if accepted - maybe Gdx.net? \n\nPlease have a look at  the PurchaseManager javadoc: I added some examples how to (1) setup the system, (2) make purchases and (3) restore purchase. That's basically all that there is to it. It is very simplistic but it will allow to support IAP on all platforms.\n\nTo make it platform-independent, there is no support for downloadable content/listing of items/icons/prices etc. It might be a good idea to create some services/wrappers around the basic interfaces I provided in the long run (e.g. someone could setup a server) that would take care of all that. \n\nPlease provide feedback - I am happy to revise.

been testing this change for over a month now and haven't found any problems with it. It shouldn't break backward compatibility with existing code (except for a deprecated warning perhaps). It doubled my fps when using large shaders (alot of uniforms and attributes).\n\nThe original implementation used a lot of string comparisons to find the location of the uniform/attribute. This change adds the ability to use an int for that. It maintains a global array of all uniform/attribute names and uses the index within that array to identify the attribute/uniform.\n\nFor now it uses a helper class (Parameter) to map the global id to the location and type within that shader. It can be futher optimized by using one, two or three int[] array instead. In my tests I found that shader locations could be just as well the index of that array. I'm currently experimenting with that, but i'm afraid that it might break in some rare situations. So the helper class is just to be safe.\n\nI added \"ByGUID\" to the methods to identify the difference between location and guid (both int). I'm not sure about that naming, but haven't come up with something better. Any suggestions are welcome.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/91/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/90","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/90/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/90/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/90/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/90","id":7893326,"number":90,"title":"Rename

OpenGL, window size, inputs etc. is now pixels! @Mario: this is how you wanted it from the beginning. Again, I have no preference pixels vs points. The only reason I did points at first was that's what appears to be the default on iOS. Now, that we forced iOS to use pixels, let's go with pixels :-D\n\nEDIT: I also got the sockets (both client + server) to work on iOS. Doing a timeout-based accept() method turned out to be a major pain to implement (over async callbacks). In any case, sockets are fully working on the iOS backend too (tested with Tropical Stormfront). And yes, sockets are full working on LWJGL + Android as well :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/77/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/76","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/76/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/76/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/76/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/76","id":7669514,"number":76,"title":"added missing SetMaxLength wrapper for b2RopeJoint","user":{"login":"ttencate","id":90930,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/90930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttencate","html_url":"https://github.com/ttencate","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttencate/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttencate/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttencate/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttencate/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttencate/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttencate/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttencate/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttencate/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttencate/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2012-10-17T21:09:19Z","updated_at":"2013-09-14T19:10:48Z","closed_at":"2012-10-17T21:12:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/76","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/76","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/76.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/76.patch"},"body":"After some tinkering, I managed to build this by running the \"gdx\" project from Eclipse choosing GdxBuild for the main class, then running \"ant -DbuildNatives=true\".
