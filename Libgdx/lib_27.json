A workaround to use them still would be to check keyTyped() in conjunction, but this is not ideal.\n\nIn my case, on an AZERTY (French) Macbook Pro (see layout [here](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AzlASSbTL._SL1500_.jpg), it has one extra character key compared to an US keyboard), the top-left _#@_ key gets the UNKNOWN keycode treatment (GRAVE being the bottom left _<>_). Other reports of this behavior may include this [old issue](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2263#issuecomment-53264980), and this recent [forum post](http://www.badlogicgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=22724).\n\nUnder the hood, for my _#@_ example, the LWJGL 2 and 3 backends each actually report a specific keycode,  but those keycodes get map to UNKNOWN in LwjglInput / Lwjgl3Input as they have no equivalent in Input.Keys:\n- LWJGL3 gives [GLFW_KEY_WORLD_1](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__keys.html) for this _#@_ key,\n- while LWJGL2 returns a quite unrelated [KEY_SECTION](http://legacy.lwjgl.org/javadoc/constant-values.html#org.lwjgl.input.Keyboard.KEY_SECTION) (for a hypothetical _§_ key I suppose).\n\nI don’t think the LWJGL2 case is worth taking a look at, as the backend will be phased out, plus a solution could prove ugly to implement if there’s a wide list of possible additional keycodes.\n\nHowever, regarding the LWJGL3 backend, GLFW seems to provide just two keycodes specifically for this use case (GLFW_KEY_WORLD_1 and GLFW_KEY_WORLD_2). **As such, could two equivalent keycodes be added in Input.Keys and mapped adequately in the LWJGL3 backend?**\n#### Reproduction steps/code\n- Have a non-US keyboard with additional character keys\n- Find the key(s) returning 0 with this code and some key mashing : )\n\n```\npackage com.mygdx.game;\n\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.*;\n\npublic class MyGdxGame extends InputAdapter implements ApplicationListener {\n\n    @Override\n    public void create

Issue details\n\nThe display mode that reports LWJGL2 backend is only the initial mode, which normally results in the highest display frequency even when display mode is changed with lower frequency.\n\nPossible solution was provided in #3903 but caused #3997, probably due to attempting to get display mode in window mode (not confirmed) probably due to window not having own hz/bpp parameters as its not a \"monitor display mode\" per se\n\nMaybe an alternate solution would be to provide a dedicated getHZ/getBPP or similar mechanism to workaround the limitation.\n####

wanted to subclass a `Group` that could only contain a certain kind of `Actor`. This would result in an unnecessary amount of casting from an Actor to a subclass. \n\nI thought about making my own implementation of group but that stops quite a few of the group parts of the API from working (e.g. I can no longer set `actor.parent`).\n\nThe logical conclusion of this is to make Groups generic.\n\nAny implementation I can think of will lead to breaking BC in some way. At first I tried creating a `class GenericGroup<T extends Actor>` and then re-implemented Group to simply be:\n\n``` java\npublic class Group extends GenericGroup<Actor> { }\n```\n\nBut that broke things in spectacular ways.\n\nChanging `Group` to `Group<T extends Actor>` is far more stable and if things do break it's a little more obvious, so that's what this PR contains.\n\nI'm still not sure that this is the best way to move forward or even if something like this is required. I wanted to see what other people thought about this.\n## Reverse for Actors\n\nThe complement to this is to make an `ActorContainer` interface. The generic `Group` would implement this and then all types of Group can be replaced with this. This would allow for people to create the lighter implementations of groups and successfully set actor's parents.\n\nThis may be overkill, though.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4106","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4106/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4106/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4106/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4106","id":157340836,"number":4106,"title":"Distance Field Font renders certain characters with improper padding","user":{"login":"SasLuca","id":15983269,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15983269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SasLuca","html_url":"https://github.com/SasLuca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SasLuca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SasLuca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SasLuca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SasLuca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SasLuca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SasLuca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SasLuca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SasLuca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SasLuca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336980,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-05-28T14:19:04Z","updated_at":"2016-12-04T15:47:07Z","closed_at":"2016-12-04T15:47:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#### Issue details\n\nWhen rendering text on screen using Distance Field Fonts as described in the tutorial, some letters have the wrong padding.

When a music ends, we set the position to the looping point in the completion listener and starts playing it again. \nThis is nice because we only  want to hear the intro the first time.\n\nSince the music is in a stopped state in the listener, we will get a short pause each time the music loops, making it sound laggy. Some songs are from the starting point to the end just 30 seconds, giving us a \"pause\" ever half minute.\n\nIn TinySound for example, the completion listener is executed even if looping is set to true. So we simply set the position there and the results are smooth and nice.\n\nCan we get something similar in LibGDX?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4100","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4100/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4100/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4100/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4100","id":156717332,"number":4100,"title":"Quaterion.getAngleAround returns wrong angle at certain angles","user":{"login":"Kerai","id":5302664,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5302664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kerai","html_url":"https://github.com/Kerai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kerai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kerai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kerai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kerai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kerai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kerai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kerai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kerai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kerai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-05-25T10:36:24Z","updated_at":"2016-05-25T12:01:07Z","closed_at":"2016-05-25T11:56:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#### Issue details\n\nQuaterion.getAngleAround returns wrong angle at certain angles (above 239 in this case)\nSeems to be the same issue as #2547 but it was incorrectly closed.
