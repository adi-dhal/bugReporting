On Android it seemed to be much more breakable then on the Desktop Version.\nSo I started to check where this behavior comes from. The strange Thing is, that in Debugging Mode the behavior is like in the Desktop Version. Only in release mode it breaks faster. Using fixed Timesteps. \n\nI logged the NormalImpulse(or the Sum), by implementing a custom ContactListener, which delegates to the BreakableManager.\n\nIn the CallBack of my Breakable Object i log more detailed Information (all Components of the normal Impulse), but only if the Body is destroyed.\nLook at Collision NR28:\n\nDesktop:\n\nNormal Impulse: 0.29399997 Collision NR26\nNormal Impulse: 0.29400006 Collision NR27\nNormal Impulse: 3.79384 Collision NR28\nNormal Impulse: 0.29400003 Collision NR29\nNormal Impulse: 0.29400003 Collision NR30\n\nAndroid:\n\nNormal Impulse: 0.29399997 Collision NR26\nNormal Impulse: 0.29400006 Collision NR27\nNormal Impulse: 54.596504 Collision NR28\nNomalImpulse: 3.79384 n0\nNomalImpulse: 50.802666 n1\nTangentImpulse: -0.93856573 n0\nTangentImpulse: 5.5101436E19 n1\nBox strained with NormalImpuse: 54.596504 TangetImpulse: 5.5101436E19\nCritical Collision destroying Body 20.0\nNormal Impulse: 0.29400003 Collision NR29\nNormal Impulse: 0.29400003 Collision NR30\n\nAs you can see there is a significantly higher Impulse on Android Release Version (NR28). And the Component of N28 is NormalImpulse n1, which is exactly the differnce. NormalImpulse n0 matches the NormalImpulse on Desktop Version. So now i can ignore n1 part, but i guess something is wrong here?\n\nIn Debugging Mode everything is fine, like in Desktop Version.\nI found some related Issue, which could be a related problem: https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/916\n\nAny Ideas to fix?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1680","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1680/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1680/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1680/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1680","id":31323556,"number":1680,"title":"Don't require Android SDK in gdx-setup","user":{"login":"cypherdare","id":1843131,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1843131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare","html_url":"https://github.com/cypherdare","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336982,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true},{"id":89046741,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/gradle","name":"gradle","color":"006b75","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2014-04-11T12:29:41Z","updated_at":"2014-04-16T15:34:26Z","closed_at":"2014-04-16T15:34:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I use libgdx at work to create desktop-only apps for simple animations.
