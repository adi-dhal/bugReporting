It sometimes happens that the drawable is rendered at places that exceed the size of the rect where it should actually be drawn. This is due to float precision and the way the number of times the drawable needs to be rendered is calculated.\n\nIn TiledDrawable.java ln44 there's while(x < endX). In my case x is 491.80124 while endX is 491.80127. Consequently the drawable is rendered again exceeding the actual size. Since this depends on the size of the drawable and the rect it should be rendered in I can't provide a simple test. The problem is evident though, the solution prolly simple:\nInstead of subtracting the size of the drawable every time calculate the number of drawables that fit into the rect ONCE. Render the drawables. calculate remaining area/width/height by subtracting widthRect - numRenderedHorizontal*regionWidth and fill the rest with a cropped version of the drawable.\n\nScreenshot: The problem is in the bottom right corner. The panel's border is extended to the right of the screen.\n![2015-04-09 10_37_25-canyonwave](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4849383/7063141/75c1b86a-dea4-11e4-8143-6e9fbe316408.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3017/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3016","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3016/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3016/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3016/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3016","id":67306039,"number":3016,"title":"Render called between pause and resume","user":{"login":"nooone","id":5896510,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5896510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone","html_url":"https://github.com/nooone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2015-04-09T08:19:17Z","updated_at":"2015-04-09T16:21:26Z","closed_at":"2015-04-09T13:11:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Today I've realized that `render()` is still called in between `pause()` and `resume()` on desktop (at least on Windows 7+8).\n\nI think the current implementation calls pause and resume when the window loses and regains focus. In some cases that's probably a good way to be notified about those events. However in _most_ cases, I believe, it's causing problems or at least inconveniences (like being moved to a pause screen every time I switch to another window when I'm not in full-screen mode).\n\nIn two of my games I'm also taking the time between pause and resume into account of my gameplay logic. However, because the standard render(deltaTime) is still called in between pause and resume, I'm actually counting that time twice, which in one game of mine causes a doubled penalty, in the other a doubled bonus.\n\nI don't think that people still expect render to be called after a pause (also [the lifecycle graph](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/The-life-cycle) in the wiki does not show that). And somehow I think that it's also _wrong_.\n\nI believe that a better solution would be, to make this configurable via `LwjglApplicationConfiguration`, but _disable_ it by default. That's the default behaviour that makes sense to me the most. However, if we want to maintain backwards compatibility, we could also enable it by default (however, I really don't think that anyone actually relies on the fact, that there's a pause + resume in this case).\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3016/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3015","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3015/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3015/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3015/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/3015","id":67286989,"number":3015,"title":"Make uniform names for array struct consistent across drivers","user":{"login":"vbousquet","id":2796036,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2796036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbousquet","html_url":"https://github.com/vbousquet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbousquet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbousquet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbousquet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbousquet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbousquet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbousquet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbousquet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbousquet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbousquet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-04-09T05:51:12Z","updated_at":"2015-04-09T11:40:43Z","closed_at":"2015-04-09T06:49:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/3015","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/3015","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/3015.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/3015.patch"},"body":"Sadly, as far as I understand, OpenGL ES spec does not specify if first element name of struct array must be reported as `struct[0].field` or `struct.field`.

The \"models/example/working.g3db\" looks correct when rendered without the broken one. The only difference is that the cloak has an additional texture assigned in \"models/example/broken.g3db\". \n\nIt seems that the a_boneWeight attributes are not passed to the shader correctly.\n\nHow to reproduce:\n- Use the following code:\n\n``` java\npublic class Screen implements ApplicationListener {\n\n    private Camera camera;\n    private ModelBatch modelBatch;\n    private Environment environment;\n    private ModelInstance workingInstance;\n    private ModelInstance brokenInstance;\n    private AnimationController workingController;\n    private AnimationController brokenController;\n\n    @Override\n    public void create() {\n        camera = new PerspectiveCamera(67, Gdx.graphics.getWidth(), Gdx.graphics.getHeight());\n        camera.position.set(3f, 2f, 5f);\n        camera.lookAt(0f, 0f, 0f);\n        camera.near = 0.1f;\n        camera.far = 100.0f;\n        camera.update();\n\n        modelBatch = new ModelBatch();\n\n        environment = new Environment();\n\n        environment.set(new ColorAttribute(ColorAttribute.AmbientLight, 1f, 1f, 1f, 1.0f));\n        DirectionalLight dirLight = new DirectionalLight();\n        dirLight.set(Color.WHITE, 0f, -1f, 0f);\n        environment.add(dirLight);\n\n        final UBJsonReader reader = new UBJsonReader();\n        final G3dModelLoader loader = new G3dModelLoader(reader);\n        final Model workingModel = loader.loadModel(Gdx.files.internal(\"models/example/working.g3db\"));\n        final Model brokenModel = loader.loadModel(Gdx.files.internal(\"models/example/broken.g3db\"));\n\n        workingInstance = new ModelInstance(workingModel);\n        brokenInstance = new ModelInstance(brokenModel);\n\n        workingInstance.transform.translate(1f, 0f, 0f);\n        brokenInstance.transform.translate(-1f, 0f, 0f);\n\n        workingController = new AnimationController(workingInstance);\n        brokenController = new AnimationController(brokenInstance);\n\n        workingController.setAnimation(\"wave\", -1);\n        brokenController.setAnimation(\"wave\", -1);\n\n        Gdx.input.setInputProcessor(new CameraInputController(camera));\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void resize(int width, int height) {\n        camera.viewportHeight = height;\n        camera.viewportWidth = width;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void render() {\n        Gdx.gl.glClearColor(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f, 0);\n        Gdx.gl.glClear(GL20.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL20.GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);\n        workingController.update(Gdx.graphics.getDeltaTime());\n        brokenController.update(Gdx.graphics.getDeltaTime());\n        modelBatch.begin(camera);\n        //modelBatch.render(workingInstance, environment);\n        modelBatch.render(brokenInstance, environment);\n        modelBatch.end();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void pause() {\n\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void resume() {\n\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void dispose() {\n        modelBatch.dispose();\n    }\n}\n```\n- Download the models http://www.file-upload.net/download-10501007/example.zip.html\n- Add the models to the assets\n- Run the application.

I spotted 2 problems happening when the drawn BitmapFont is scaled:\n\nThe y Position of the whole drawn text seems to be working differently than before (not sure exactly how it works now, but it neither aligns the top nor the bottom to the specified y. the only thing i can think of is that the default align is center by default but I'd need to check on that and try it out (in my setup I had the y Position depending on the lineheight/2f but as that didnt work anymore I set a fixed y position for testing purposes))\n\nThe y Position of certain letters gets screwed up, if the font has been scaled (in this example, the 7 is vertically bigger than the other letters and thats the one appearing screwed up vertically when the font is scaled)\n\n![screenshot 2015-04-02 01 08

setScale() (one is about 0.3f I think and the other one is 1)\n\nAny insight or help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nEdit:\n\nSSCCE:
