This allows for tightly packing many glyphs into a single page.\n- BitmapFont, BitmapFontCache, and FreeTypeFontGenerator now support BMFont files with multiple glyphs pages.\n\nAs a result, `BitmapFontData.imagePath` and `BitmapFontData.getImagePath()` have been deprecated, and replaced by `imagePaths[]` and `getImagePath(int index)`. Likewise, the same has been done with the `getTextureRegion()` method of FreeTypeBitmapFontData. These could be removed if we're OK with breaking old code. \n\nUsers are encouraged to use `BitmapFont.getRegions()` and the TextureRegion[] constructor for greater compatibility with font files. I did not deprecate `BitmapFont.getRegion()` -- although maybe it should be, for consistency's sake.\n\nSee the CHANGES file, as well as FreeTypePackTest and BitmapFontTest. \n## Future Thoughts:\n\nI am currently working on a tool which allows you to specify many BMFont files and TTF files, and it will **tightly** pack all their glyphs into the same texture(s). It then produces a JSON file with details for each FNT (size, name, etc), and ultimately a FontMapper class to facilitate the loading of them. I feel this does not quite belong in the LibGDX codebase; at least not until markup/multi-font text is added to scene2D and BitmapFontCache.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/493","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/493/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/493/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/493/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/493","id":16284162,"number":493,"title":"Bullet: keep reference to MotionState and CollisionShape","user":{"login":"xoppa","id":2349087,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2349087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa","html_url":"https://github.com/xoppa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2013-07-02T20:00:10Z","updated_at":"2014-06-16T18:51:24Z","closed_at":"2013-07-05T18:31:10Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/493","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/493","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/493.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/493.patch"},"body":"This change makes btCollisionObject, btRigidBody and btRigidBodyConstructionInfo keep a reference to its MotionState and CollisionShape.

Shader#init() and separate it from the constructor. This allows to easier extend a shader.\n\nIntroduce BaseShader#Input:\nInput replaces the previous int to identify an uniform/attribute. This allows to extend the Input to add user definable data. It also accepts a Input.Setter which (if set) gets called by default when the uniform needs to be set. This allows to keep the code needed to set an uniform together. Input also has a scope, being either:\n- VERTEX_ATTRIBUTE: obviously a vertex attribute, they are added to the public vertexAttributes array\n- GLOBAL_UNIFORM: a uniform that only needs to be set once per render pass\n- LOCAL_UNIFORM: a uniform that needs to be set for every renderable.\n\nUsing an Input in this way is optional, you can still use it to simply reference an uniform (like DefaultShader does). However for a more flexible Shader, it allows to better define who is responsible and when an uniform must be set. I hope to soon PR an improved CompositeShader, which relies on the change.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/481/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/480","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/480/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/480/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/480/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/480","id":15768684,"number":480,"title":"Overloading FreeTypeFontGenerator.generateData to support custom PixmapPacker","user":{"login":"mattdesl","id":1383811,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1383811?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdesl","html_url":"https://github.com/mattdesl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdesl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdesl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdesl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdesl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdesl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdesl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdesl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdesl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdesl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2013-06-19T21:11:31Z","updated_at":"2014-06-12T22:09:32Z","closed_at":"2013-07-02T19:54:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/480","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/480","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/480.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/480.patch"},"body":"This allows users to pack many glyphs into a single Texture with FreeTypeFontGenerator.

How is this intended to distinct?\n\nAdd a very basic bullet test not using the BulletEntity class.\n\nInclude bullet/extras/serialize, practically allowing to import .bullet files. This allows you to create a whole scene including physics properties within blender/maya, export it to .fbx/.bullet and load it in game. I added a test to show the usage. It also allows to easily create node based animation for kinematics bodies and gpu skinned physics ragdolls (I'll probably add a test to show that later).\n\nFix and cleanup bullet tests (they didnt properly disposed the models).\n\nNote that bullet/serialize requires std::string, which for android requires STL to be added to application.mk (APP_STL := stlport_static), I couldn't find a way to do that with gdx-jnigen, so I added that manually.\n\nTested on win64 and android.\n\nMy experience on building a bullet scene:\n- The default bullet plugin for maya is great for the purpose but doesn't export node names, so its impossible to know which model-node belongs to which bullet body.\n- The (walt disney?) opensource maya bullet dynamica plugin is somewhat restricted and requires some customization, but for most scenes it will do\n- The blender bullet plugin looks great and by far the best, but since blender uses z-up you must manually rotate the bullet world after importing for y-up.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/472","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/472/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/472/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/472/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/472","id":15374446,"number":472,"title":"Fixed Javadoc in Sound/Music interface + Fixed broken button text in Particle Editor","user":{"login":"andgeno","id":2432608,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2432608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andgeno","html_url":"https://github.com/andgeno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andgeno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andgeno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andgeno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andgeno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andgeno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andgeno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andgeno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andgeno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andgeno/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-06-10T23:42:48Z","updated_at":"2013-06-17T14:49:19Z","closed_at":"2013-06-17T14:49:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/472","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/472","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/472.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/472.patch"},"body":"Sound/Music interface:\nThe descriptions for positive and negative pan values are swapped.
