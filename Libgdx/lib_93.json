This means that MessageDispatcher has an `IntMap<Array<Agent>>` where the key is the message code and the value an array of agents.  \n- If the telegram is for a specific agent he doesn't have to be registered and the telegram will be dispatched only to him (just like before)\n- If the telegram has no explicit recipient, i.e. `telegram.receiver == null`, it will be dispatched to all the agents registered for that message code. \n\nNow I'm at a crossroads. Telegrams are created and pooled by MessageDispatcher, also a telegram might have an extraInfo object containing message-specific information. The exraInfo object might be pooled by the application, why not? In case it's pooled, how can we let the app know that the telegram has been dispatched to all the receivers and that it can be returned to the pool? \n- **Option 1**:\n  - The Agent interface has a new method `notifySender(Telegram)` that will be called by the MessageDispatcher after dispatching the telegram to the recipients and before returning the telegram to the pool. This gives the sender the opportunity to free the `telegram.extraInfo` object in case is pooled.\n  - Additionally the sender might explicitly request the notification through an optional boolean parameter passed to the `MessageDispatcher.dispatchMessage()` method that creates the telegram. Of course this means that the telegram will have a new boolean field.\n- **Option 2**:\n  After dispatching the telegram to the recipients and before returning the telegram to the pool, the  MessageDispatcher first checks if `telegram.extraInfo instanceof Pooled` then calls the free method of the Pooled interface.\n\nOption 2 is more specific and backward compatible while option 1 is more general (can be used - and abused - for all kind of stuff) but breaks compatibility.\nAlso, with option 1 it is responsibility of the sender to perform the right action based on the message code and the extraInfo object, since the sender can send telegrams carrying different types of message.\n\nI'd like to know your opinion and of course any \"option 3\" is welcome :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2130/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2129","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2129/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2129/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2129/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2129","id":38158770,"number":2129,"title":"Old

implementation used real-timing and pausing was not possible. E.g. if I post delayed message that should be dispatched in 3 sec and then pause my game for 3 or more secs, this message will be dispatched on next #dispatchDelayedMessages() immediately however in game 0 time have passed (cause of pause).\n\nCurrent implementation allows you to set the custom TimeProvider (e.g. your game level timing) that might  support such things like pause/resume or slow motion timing. By default the RealTimeProvider is used implementing previous getCurrentTime to support backward-compatibility.\n\nThe other solution is to use something like standard #update(float delta) to accumulate current time, but this will be breaking implementation, so I used current approach.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2121/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2120","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2120/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2120/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2120/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2120","id":37959491,"number":2120,"title":"[enhancement] [scene2d] Add addedToStage() and removedFromStage() methods to Actor","user":{"login":"vlaaad","id":732554,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/732554?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlaaad","html_url":"https://github.com/vlaaad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlaaad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlaaad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlaaad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlaaad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlaaad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlaaad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlaaad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlaaad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlaaad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-07-16T08:24:11Z","updated_at":"2014-07-16T11:03:23Z","closed_at":"2014-07-16T10:57:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Actor/Group have some useful methods for overriding, like `sizeChanged()` and `childrenChanged()`. I suggest to add methods `addedToStage()`, called when Actor is added to stage, and `removedFromStage()`, called when Actor is removed from stage.\n\nThis can be useful, for example, if Actors should listen to some outside events when on stage, but be available for GC when removed. For example, user can need to create label that updates it's text when user changes his language in app settings. Instead of managing label's text externally, it's easier for this kind of label to manage itself. It will just start listen when displayed and stop listen when removed. For now user can override `setStage()` method to achieve this functionality, but adding these methods looks cleaner.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2119","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2119/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2119/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2119/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2119","id":37954758,"number":2119,"title":"If

comment: Added MultiAspectViewport and created ViewportTestMultiAspectRatio for testing the class.\n\nSummary: I needed a view port which could account for many aspect ratios, being 4:3 - 16:9. I liked the solution that was presented for Clash of the Olympians, but it did not work like they said. I now have a proper working version of what he was trying to create. This includes a test class to show how it works.\n\nBasic idea: Creates a new FitViewport at largest possible size that preserves a certain range of view port aspect ratios and sizes. While it does not extend FitViewport, it does the same basic thing.\n\nHere is a download to a working example (JAR): https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5FgN8-ZK8hPWUNka0Y5eG5zTFk/edit?usp=sharing\n\nHere is virus total for the JAR: https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/29c32c5403183bb5bfec4fd46b3e426d5a9cf9966cce124a58e5a89530697975/analysis/1405450317/\n\n**Ikarus is presenting a false positive for the virus total.\n\nAs you can see, for any give screen width and height it will not show red as long as it is between 4:3 and 16:9.\n\nPlease let me know if you think this would be helpful to libgdx and its community.\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4906","x-ratelimit-reset":"1506844633","x-github-request-id":"B60E:0287:8500D1:11D845A:59D09612","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=94>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=164>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=92>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"3cc70e78cec99f575ec8dafc7e92e53e\"","status":"200 OK"}}
