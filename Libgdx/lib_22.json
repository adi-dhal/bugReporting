This is due to the field \"renderedSeconds\" being set to 0 once there isn't data to be put on one of the buffer, even with the other two buffers still not processed.\n#### Reproduction steps/code\n\nThe music being used for this example was .wav, 10s long, 16bit, 44100Hz, mono --> 10s_2bytes_44100Hz = 882000 bytes of music. It was set to loop and, on the first loop, the method music.getPosition() did not go all the way to 10s, instead only went to 9.287981859s before going back to 0, and here is why: \n\nThe class OpenALMusic uses three byte buffers of maximum size 40960 bytes each to transfer data to the audio device. In this example it is needed 21 buffers of size 40960 bytes and 1 of size 21840 bytes to pass all the 882000 bytes of music data on each loop. The problem is that a parameter that gives the information on music.getPosition() is reset once there is no data on ONE of the buffers, not all three.\n\nIn this example: the last three buffers sizes of the loop are: 1-40960 bytes; 2-40960 bytes; 3-21840 bytes. Once the first buffer is completely processed, the music is reset, taking music.getPosition() to 0 again, but there still was (40960+21840)bytes = 0.712018141s of data before the end of the loop.\n\nThe following code snippet is from OpenALMusic. The update() method calls fill(int bufferID) and resets renderedSeconds to 0 once there isn't data to be put on one of the three buffers, leading to a value of 0 being returned from getPosition() before the end of the loop.\n\n``` java\npublic float getPosition () {\n      if (audio.noDevice) return 0;\n      if (sourceID == -1) return 0;\n      return renderedSeconds + alGetSourcef(sourceID, AL11.AL_SEC_OFFSET);\n   }\n\npublic void update () {\n      if (audio.noDevice) return;\n      if (sourceID == -1) return;\n\n      boolean end = false;\n      int buffers = alGetSourcei(sourceID, AL_BUFFERS_PROCESSED);\n      while (buffers-- > 0) {\n         int bufferID = alSourceUnqueueBuffers(sourceID);\n         if (bufferID == AL_INVALID_VALUE) break;\n         renderedSeconds += secondsPerBuffer;\n         if (end) continue;\n         if (fill(bufferID))\n            alSourceQueueBuffers(sourceID, bufferID);\n         else\n            end = true;\n      }\n      if (end && alGetSourcei(sourceID, AL_BUFFERS_QUEUED) == 0) {\n         stop();\n         if (onCompletionListener != null) onCompletionListener.onCompletion(this);\n      }\n\n      // A buffer underflow will cause the source to stop.\n      if (isPlaying && alGetSourcei(sourceID, AL_SOURCE_STATE) != AL_PLAYING) alSourcePlay(sourceID);\n   }\n\nprivate boolean fill (int bufferID) {\n      tempBuffer.clear();\n      int length = read(tempBytes);\n      if (length <= 0) {\n         if (isLooping) {\n            loop();\n            renderedSeconds = 0;\n            length = read(tempBytes);\n            if (length <= 0) return false;\n         } else\n            return false;\n      }\n      tempBuffer.put(tempBytes, 0, length).flip();\n      alBufferData(bufferID, format, tempBuffer, sampleRate);\n      return true;\n   }\n```\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\n\n1.9.4\n#### Stacktrace\n\n``` java\n//Please provide the stacktrace if applicable \n```\n#### Please select the affected platforms\n- [ ] Android\n- [ ] iOS (robovm)\n- [ ] iOS (MOE)\n- [ ] HTML/GWT\n- [X] Windows\n- [X] Linux\n- [X] MacOS\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4267","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4267/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4267/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4267/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4267","id":172815396,"number":4267,"title":"Race condition on AndroidGraphicsLiveWallpaper","user":{"login":"lucasdupin","id":88702,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/88702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasdupin","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasdupin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasdupin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasdupin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasdupin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasdupin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasdupin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasdupin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasdupin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasdupin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasdupin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-08-23T21:46:34Z","updated_at":"2016-12-04T12:53:15Z","closed_at":"2016-12-04T12:53:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hey all,\nWe found a deadlock that happens on Android live wallpapers.\n#### Issue details\n\nThere was a race condition between the GL thread and the main thread, when resuming wallpapers.

Load index.html\n2. Synchronously load the javascript files\n3. Preload assets, get them cached in the browser (This is currently, where a player would see the libGDX logo and a progress bar).\n4. (optional) Loading assets into memory with a custom loading screen via an AssetManager\n\nIn smaller games this is can be acceptable loads times. However as a game grows I have generally found that whilst the code size (The JS files are around 1-3MB) the art (Artists demanding HD level quality) the process of getting a player into the game becomes longer and drawn out and offputting. I have also been involved in projects where a HTML5 gaming platform would require a single loading experience for all binary and asset loading, providing their own loading screen etc.\n\nI have a working example of a game where the JS is split and a boot strap occurs first then the main game JS is loaded separately. Then any assets are then loaded on demand, e.g. the AssetManager wishes to load a texture, this request is intercepted and the browser instructed to download the asset, then the loading into memory can occur.\n\nBefore I unleash this all on the world I wanted to see if I could clean up a couple of things in the GWT backend to make what I did simplier and cleaner looking. So this commit is more about setting the stage ready for the next phase of the loading.\n\nWhen going through the code, I discovered that the canvasId that can be specified in the configuration is never used. Thus never letting you create and specify your own canvas, this commit fixes that.\n1. I moved the preloading code into separate classes and I created an interface to allow other people to create their own preloaders and reuse the existing download code.\n2. I have removed the config.root property as it was no longer needed, the code now only checks for the presence of the canvasId field.\n3. If the canvasId does exist, the default preloader will still create the progress bar and libGDX logo except upon completion it no longers creates the canvas\n\nThis is backwards compatible and I have tested it the project created via the project setup tool.\n\nI hope this makes sense to people, if I have done something I shouldn't have please let me know and I will fix it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4265/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4264","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4264/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4264/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4264/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4264","id":172344574,"number":4264,"title":"Errors while using remove() on utility collections' Iterator","user":{"login":"Xemiru","id":1240058,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1240058?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xemiru","html_url":"https://github.com/Xemiru","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xemiru/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xemiru/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xemiru/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xemiru/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xemiru/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xemiru/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xemiru/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xemiru/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xemiru/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-08-21T22:16:26Z","updated_at":"2016-11-25T00:58:08Z","closed_at":"2016-11-25T00:58:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#### Issue details\n\nThe issue addressed by ff6f7ca68a92c286ba22fdcb6f0fe444aff91f66 still occurs with other iterators. This has been tested only with the `OrderedMap$Value` iterator, though it is likely that it occurs with other iterators. It seems to occur due to `remove()` not updating the `hasNext` flag.\n#### Reproduction steps/code\n\nSimply iterating over values and attempting to remove them can cause this issue. Note, that it seems to be inconsistent, and may take a few runs in order to produce an error.\n\n``` java\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.utils.OrderedMap;\n\nimport java.util.Iterator;\n\npublic class Program {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        OrderedMap<Integer, Object> map = new OrderedMap<>();\n        for (int i = 0; i < 16; i++) {\n            map.put(i, new Object());\n        }\n\n        Iterator<Object> iter = map.values();\n        while (iter.hasNext()) {\n            iter.next();\n            System.out.println(\"removed\");\n            iter.remove();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe above code sometimes resolves to something like this output.\n\n```\nremoved\nremoved\nremoved\nremoved\nremoved\nremoved\nremoved\nremoved\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: index can't be >= size: 8 >= 8\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.utils.Array.get(Array.java:127)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.utils.OrderedMap$OrderedMapValues.next(OrderedMap.java:228)\n    at Program.main(Program.java:19)\n```\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\n\nSupposedly on v1.9.3.

I created a class that extends Window and I have added buttons and things to it. My issue is that for some reason, it randomly fades the font used to render the text on text buttons, labels and window title (textfields are unaffected for some reason). Sometimes it is half faded and some times it is fully faded and you can't see the text at all, just the element.\n\nAlso, if it wasn't already fully faded the first time, it completely fades the second time I open the menu. And if I go back to the main menu, the fonts get messed up their too even though they were fine when I loaded up the main menu to play the game.\n\nCould there be a bug with the font rendering? I tested everything. I don't change the color of the font or the batch and it still does this.\n\nHere are 2 images to show what happens: http://imgur.com/a/FB82i\n\nHere is my project: https://github.com/vedi0boy/Archipelo/. The classes that would be of concern are in the core under src at \"screen/GameScreen.java\" (renderUi is where I call stage.draw()) and \"screen/gamescreen/MainMenuWindow.java\" and as you can see (it also happens in \"screen/gamescreen/MainMenuWindow.java\"), I don't ever set the font color. It happens on it's own. I do change the batch color in other classes but if this was the issue, wouldn't the whole stage be affected, not just the font?\n\nThanks in advance!\n#### Reproduction steps/code\n\nI simply open the window and it does this.\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\n\nv1.9.3 and I don't use any other ui related dependencies. Just networking stuff.\n#### Stacktrace\n\nVisual bug, no stacktrace.\n#### Please select the affected platforms\n- [x ] Windows (I have only tested windows so far)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4258","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4258/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4258/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4258/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4258","id":172077030,"number":4258,"title":"Unicode font not rendering properly","user":{"login":"chandujr","id":14921501,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/14921501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chandujr","html_url":"https://github.com/chandujr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chandujr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chandujr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chandujr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chandujr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chandujr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chandujr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chandujr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chandujr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chandujr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-08-19T08:08:54Z","updated_at":"2016-11-25T00:39:04Z","closed_at":"2016-11-25T00:39:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#### Issue details\n\nI'm using an Indian font ([Malayalam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam_script), specifically) in my app. I used `FreeTypeFontGenerator` to generate `BitmapFont` that I use in Actors.

But what I'm getting is the 2nd image. One particular character is split into it's component elements where it should be combined automatically. There are other similar characters in this language that shows this property. I actually don't know the technical thing going on behind this conversion. In many situations, the conversion is done automatically (e.g., in Character Map in Windows, see below). The 1st image is got by using a non-unicode font which has all characters ready-made. In both the cases, I had to supply all the characters to the `FreeTypeFontGenerator` using `FreeTypeFontParameter`.\n\n---\n\n![unicode_conv](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14921501/17802071/90e083ac-660b-11e6-9d36-3c67022d4e1c.gif)\n_Note the character conversion._\n\n---\n####

From what I can gather, these log messages are always sent to stdout as that is the default behavior of the lwjgl logger. \n\nI suggest adding a feature which would allow developers to change that default behavior and set a different output stream/writer, add new writers, or hook onto the current log methods so that they might also be output somewhere else (such as a file or dev console).\n\nFor example, let's say that the game has a dev console and we wish to redirect all logging calls to the in-game dev console instead of stdout. Ideally it would look something like this:\n\n```\n// Create a custom output writer\npublic class ConsoleWriter extends Writer     \n     //........\n     public void write(char cbuf[], int off, int len) throws IOException {\n           console.write(cbuf, off, len);\n     }\n     //........\n}\n\nGdx.app.setLogWriter(new ConsoleWriter()); \n// from this point on all Gdx.app.log/error/debug invocations will write to the ConsoleWriter instead of stdout\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4251/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4250","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4250/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4250/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4250/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4250","id":171110608,"number":4250,"title":"Fixed issue 4129","user":{"login":"likeanowl","id":10586429,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10586429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/likeanowl","html_url":"https://github.com/likeanowl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likeanowl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likeanowl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likeanowl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likeanowl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likeanowl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likeanowl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likeanowl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likeanowl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likeanowl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-08-15T05:30:04Z","updated_at":"2016-12-04T13:38:18Z","closed_at":"2016-12-04T13:38:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/4250","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4250","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4250.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4250.patch"},"body":"Related to #4129 issue.\nAdded method getListeners() to Controller interface and implemented it in child classes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4249","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4249/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4249/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4249/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4249","id":171109435,"number":4249,"title":"Fixed issue 3659","user":{"login":"likeanowl","id":10586429,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10586429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/likeanowl","html_url":"https://github.com/likeanowl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likeanowl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likeanowl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likeanowl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likeanowl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likeanowl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likeanowl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likeanowl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likeanowl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likeanowl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-08-15T05:14:03Z","updated_at":"2016-08-15T17:17:54Z","closed_at":"2016-08-15T17:17:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/4249","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4249","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4249.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4249.patch"},"body":"Related to #3659 issue.\nAdded clear() method.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4249/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4978","x-ratelimit-reset":"1506844633","x-github-request-id":"B3CA:028A:1AA777A:2EB755F:59D09392","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=23>;
