dialog begins to hide and not when animation is done.\nSecond commit fixes this

This would be very useful to me (and many other users, I'm sure).\n\nAlso, I'm sorry if there is already a post about this, I have no idea how to use GitHub...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1237/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1236","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1236/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1236/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1236/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1236","id":26244484,"number":1236,"title":"com.badlogic.gdx.utils.LongMap should implement constructor with LongMap<V>","user":{"login":"Kernle32DLL","id":1338408,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1338408?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kernle32DLL","html_url":"https://github.com/Kernle32DLL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kernle32DLL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kernle32DLL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kernle32DLL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kernle32DLL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kernle32DLL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kernle32DLL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kernle32DLL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kernle32DLL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kernle32DLL/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-01-24T14:41:28Z","updated_at":"2014-01-24T20:27:28Z","closed_at":"2014-01-24T20:27:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"com.badlogic.gdx.utils.LongMap should implement a constructor with another LongMap<V>, analog to the other maps of java, for example HashMap:\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html#HashMap%28java.util.Map%29\n\nAnalog to issue https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1235 this applies to all maps in com.badlogic.gdx.utils.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1235","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1235/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1235/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1235/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1235","id":26244237,"number":1235,"title":"com.badlogic.gdx.utilsLongMap.Keys should implement Iterable<Long> and Iterator<Long>","user":{"login":"Kernle32DLL","id":1338408,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1338408?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kernle32DLL","html_url":"https://github.com/Kernle32DLL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kernle32DLL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kernle32DLL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kernle32DLL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kernle32DLL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kernle32DLL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kernle32DLL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kernle32DLL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kernle32DLL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kernle32DLL/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-01-24T14:37:30Z","updated_at":"2014-01-24T19:55:16Z","closed_at":"2014-01-24T14:39:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"com.badlogic.gdx.utils.LongMap.Keys should implement Iterable<Long> and Iterator<Long>, analog to com.badlogic.gdx.utils.LongMap.Values.\n\nRight now this is possible:\nfor (SomeObject value: mLongMap.values()) {...}\n\nBut his is not:\nfor (Long key : mLongMap.keys()) {...}\n\nThis applies to all ...Map.Keys classes in com.badlogic.gdx.utils btw...

I'll describe on of them. I created a projectile hit effect that had a life of 3000 ms.  When loaded into my game, it worked fine.

I've double-checked that the .p file was saved correctly.  I can close the particle editor and then reload the .p file, and it is the new and correct animation.\n\nI'm saving the particle effect files from the particle editor and then loading those into the game.\n\nI also thought that perhaps the files were cached somewhere.

seem to be two methods with this name, of which one seems to work as expected (Array<Vector2>) while the other one (float[], offset, ) either needs more comments describing the parameters to the method or it does not work as expected. \n\nI used the same polygon points for testing in both methods.  i moved them from the float[] to  the Array<Vector> and that worked fine. I used offset=0 and count=6 for the Hexagonal polygon i was working with in the non working test. Not sure what does two are for since count can be calculated from the array size (divide by 2). What is the offset for?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1219","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1219/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1219/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1219/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1219","id":25885081,"number":1219,"title":"Make it impossible to scale BitmapFont to zero","user":{"login":"Darkyenus","id":5280068,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5280068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus","html_url":"https://github.com/Darkyenus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-01-19T18:13:04Z","updated_at":"2014-06-20T12:10:06Z","closed_at":"2014-01-19T19:23:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/1219","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1219","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1219.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1219.patch"},"body":"For issue #1218\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1218","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1218/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1218/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1218/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1218","id":25884620,"number":1218,"title":"Calling BitmapFont.setScale(0) will make the font forever unusable","user":{"login":"Darkyenus","id":5280068,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5280068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus","html_url":"https://github.com/Darkyenus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-01-19T17:49:34Z","updated_at":"2014-01-20T02:29:16Z","closed_at":"2014-01-19T20:07:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This happens because of implementation, that scales font relatively.
