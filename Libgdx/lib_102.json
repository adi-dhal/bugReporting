To achieve this, translations/scales are lerped and rotations are slerped. By definition, more than two Quaternions are slerped by:\n\n```\n(q_1^w_1)*(q_2^w_2)* ... *(q_n^w_n)\n```\n\nwhere `w_i` sum to 1. This is particularly useful when transform information from multiple observers must be combined into a single one. \n\nAn example usage is the following, where the red cone's transform is the equal weight average of the green cones' transforms; green cones are scaled by 1, 1.5 and 2 respectively, they are not closer to the screen than one another:\n![average](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1974284/2985238/e6636a54-dc3a-11e3-95ea-70a4fab04d02.png)\nThe code that generates these cones is:\n\n```\nModel cone = modelBuilder.createCone(20f, 20f, 20f, 20, \n    new Material(ColorAttribute.createDiffuse(Color.GREEN)), Usage.Position | Usage.Normal);\n\nModelInstance cone1 = new ModelInstance(cone);\nQuaternion

ModelInstance(cone);\nQuaternion q2 = new Quaternion().setEulerAngles(-30, 10, -45);\nMatrix4 tf2 = new Matrix4(new Vector3(35,-35,100),q2,new Vector3(1.5f,1.5f,1.5f));\ncone2.transform.set(tf2);\n\nModelInstance cone3 = new ModelInstance(cone);\nQuaternion q3 = new Quaternion().setEulerAngles(0, 40, 20);\nMatrix4 tf3 = new Matrix4(new Vector3(35,35,100),q3,new Vector3(2,2,2));\ncone3.transform.set(tf3);\n\nModel resultCone = modelBuilder.createCone(20f, 20f, 20f, 20, \n    new Material(ColorAttribute.createDiffuse(Color.RED)), Usage.Position | Usage.Normal);\nModelInstance resultCone1 = new ModelInstance(resultCone);\nMatrix4[] tfList = new Matrix4[]{tf1,tf2,tf3};//,tf4};\nMatrix4 resultTf = new Matrix4().avg(tfList);\nresultCone1.transform.set(resultTf);\n\nmodelBatch.begin(cam);\nmodelBatch.render(cone1,environment);\nmodelBatch.render(cone2,environment);\nmodelBatch.render(cone3,environment);\nmodelBatch.render(resultCone1,environment);\nmodelBatch.end();\n```\n\nChanges

`M00` is returned which can be negative.
