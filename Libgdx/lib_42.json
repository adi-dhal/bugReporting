Going forward, i hope this can largely replace the old LWJGL 2 backend, especially on Mac OS X where we have a lot of problems with LWJGL 2. The new backend is also prepared for multi-window environments, altough respective methods in `Lwjgl3Application` haven't been exposed yet.\r\n\r\nThe LWJGL 3 backend is structure the same way as the LWJGL 2 backend, including the main module in `backends/gdx-backend-lwjgl3` and a test module in `tests/gdx-tests-lwjgl3`. Everything is wired up with Maven and Eclipse projects so you can test things. I also wired it up with our Ant build, haven't tested that one at all.\r\n\r\nIt would be amazing if you guys could help test this. I already build snapshots for the new backend, and all the code is merged with master. You can easily switch out the LWJGL 2 backend for the LWJGL 3 backend in Gradle. In your `core` projects dependencies, change:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncompile \"com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-backend-lwjgl:$gdxVersion\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n```\r\ncompile \"com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-backend-lwjgl3:$gdxVersion\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nMake sure `gdxVersion` is set to the latest snapshot version `1.7.3-SNAPSHOT`. In your desktop launcher, simply replace `LwjglApplicationConfiguration` and `LwjglApplication` with `Lwjgl3ApplicationConfiguration` and `Lwjgl3Application`. That's it.\r\n### Not implemented yet\r\n- [ ] Window refresh callback for nicer resize\r\n- [x] HDPI support. Works out of the box on mac os x, but need to scale mouse coords accordingly. They are reported in logical coords, whereas `Graphics` reports framebuffer size now.\r\n- [x] Screen mode change related functions in [Lwjgl3Graphics](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/backends/gdx-backend-lwjgl3/src/com/badlogic/gdx/backends/lwjgl3/Lwjgl3Graphics.java#L163). Just haven't gotten around implementing those. Note that when changing the screen mode (e.g. window -> fullscreen), GLFW returns a new window handle. `Lwjgl3Input` and `Lwjgl3Graphics` need to re-register all the GLFW callbacks in that case with the new window handle.\r\n- [x] Clipboard support without AWT on Mac OS X\r\n- [x] Fix fullscreen toggling. On Mac OS X, the first windowed -> fullscreen switch fails in weird ways, e.g. clearColor has an effect, but rendering doesn't. Subsequent fullscreen -> fullscreen switches work as intended (but those use `glfwSetWindowSize` instead of creating a new window). On Window (10) fullscreen switching doesn't work at all on HDPI monitors, need to test on normal monitors. [Bug for Windows](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/676), [Bug for Mac OS X](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/680). Should be resolved in GLFW, libGDX side does the proper thing.\r\n- [x] Custom cursors in `Lwjgl3Graphics`. Haven't checked how to do that yet.\r\n- [x] Application icon support. This needs to be covered via tools like [PackR](https://github.com/libgdx/packr)\r\n- [x] Platform-specific multi-window API (`Lwjgl3Application#newWindow(ApplicationListener, int width, int height)/newWindow(ApplicationListener, DisplayMode)`).\r\n- [x] Controller support. GLFW comes with its own controller API, should be simply to add that to the controllers extension. There's a [bug](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/601) on Windows in GLFW, where all gamepads are reported by the same name. This makes mapping controller types impossible.\r\n- [x] OpenGL 3.0 support. We should only need to add that to `Lwjgl3Application#createGlfwWindow`. The `Lwjgl3GL30` implementation is prepared, except for `Lwjgl3GL30#glGetBufferPointerv`\r\n- [ ] Mac OS X (potentially Windows and Linux too): glfwSwapBuffers doesn't block in windowed mode if app window is fully behind other window or minimized. [Bug](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/680) with GLFW. Could \"fix\" it in our own code.\r\n- [ ] [Lwjgl3Input#getTextInput()](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/backends/gdx-backend-lwjgl3/src/com/badlogic/gdx/backends/lwjgl3/Lwjgl3Input.java#L240), can't call into Swing/AWT\r\n- [x] Non-continuous rendering in `Lwjgl3Graphics`. It's a bit of a bitch. `Lwjgl3Input` will already call `Graphics#requestRendering()` in case new input events arrive\r\n- [ ] Make OpenALAudio thread-safe, put the update on a separate thread\r\n### Known Issues\r\n- LWJGL 3 is based on GLFW.

The method `World.getJointCount()` returns a different value than the size of the list returned by `World.getJoints()`. The list still contains joints that should have been destroyed together with the body that they were attached to.\n\nExample code (please paste as an ApplicationListener into a libGDX project):\n\n``` java\npublic class PhysicsDebug extends ApplicationAdapter {\n\n    private World world;\n\n    @Override\n    public void create () {\n        world = new World(new Vector2(0, 0),  true);\n\n        Body bodyA = createBody();\n        Body bodyB = createBody();\n        createDistanceJointBetweenBodies(bodyA, bodyB);\n        createDistanceJointBetweenBodies(bodyA, bodyB);\n\n        Gdx.app.setLogLevel(Application.LOG_DEBUG);\n\n        Gdx.app.log(\"debug\", \"Created the bodies and the joints\");\n        Gdx.app.log(\"debug\", \"world.getJointCount() -> \" + world.getJointCount() \n                           + \", world.getJoints().size -> \" + getJointsListSize());\n\n        world.destroyBody(bodyA);\n        Gdx.app.log(\"debug\", \"Destroyed the body A\");\n        Gdx.app.log(\"debug\", \"world.getJointCount() -> \" + world.getJointCount() \n                           + \", world.getJoints().size -> \" + getJointsListSize());\n\n        world.destroyBody(bodyB);\n        Gdx.app.log(\"debug\", \"Destroyed the body B\");\n        Gdx.app.log(\"debug\", \"world.getJointCount() -> \" + world.getJointCount() \n                           + \", world.getJoints().size -> \" + getJointsListSize());\n\n    }\n\n    private Body createBody() {\n        BodyDef bodyDef = new BodyDef();\n        return world.createBody(bodyDef);\n    }\n\n    private void createDistanceJointBetweenBodies(Body bodyA, Body bodyB) {\n        DistanceJointDef jointDefA = new DistanceJointDef();\n        jointDefA.bodyA = bodyA;\n        jointDefA.bodyB = bodyB;\n        world.createJoint(jointDefA);\n    }\n\n    private int getJointsListSize() {\n        Array<Joint> joints = new Array<Joint>();\n        world.getJoints(joints);\n        return joints.size;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOn desktop, the joints list is empty after destroying one of the bodies, which is the expected behaviour. The application log output:\n\n```\ndebug: Created the bodies and the joints\ndebug: world.getJointCount() -> 2, world.getJoints().size -> 2\ndebug: Destroyed the body A\ndebug: world.getJointCount() -> 0, world.getJoints().size -> 0\ndebug: Destroyed the body B\ndebug: world.getJointCount() -> 0, world.getJoints().size -> 0\n```\n\nIn the html5 client, however, the list still contains one joint, even though the `World.getJointCount()` method returns zero.

I understand why it works this way but I think it is not the expected way for the functionality it is meant to provide.\n\nWhen applying a scaling Action to a window, for example:\n\n``` java\nWindow win = new Window (\"title\", skin);\n...\nstage.addActor(win);\nwin.setScale(0, 0);\nwin.addAction(Actions.scaleTo(1, 1, 0.4f));\n```\n\nOne may expect the stageBackground drawable (which is meant to dim the rest of the stage while the dialog window is showing) to cover 100% of the screen from the beginning, even while scaling - that is, if you want a fancy window to scale in, you don't want the background dim to scale in too, but to have it full screen from the beginning. Currently the background dim drawable scales in too, resulting in a weird and undesired effect.\n\nIs this correct?
