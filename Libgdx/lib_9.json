libgdx only support interleaved vertex buffers, this is very nice for static geometry because it may be a good cache optimization (https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Vertex_Specification_Best_Practices#Interleaving), but although it may be an optimization for static geometry, for dynamic geometry changed by cpu each frame this doesn't help much, because the cache optimization you may gain in the gpu is lost in the cpu side, for example: for a morph animation implementation #2633,  I would prefer to have the attributes separated in the vertex buffer, because I am only modifying position and normals, and it is more cache friendly (I guess) if the data I will modify is close in memory (shape key blending is usually just, v[i] = v[i]+ (shape_factor)*ov[i], n[i] = n[i]+ (shape_factor)*on[i] ) .\r\n\r\nbut things may be even better, I may have only the attributes I will update separated and the static ones interleaved, well , I don't know how good would be that, but I guess in that way I may have the best of the two approaches, interleaved and separated.\r\n\r\nonly need to provide the capability of defining offsets and strides of the attributes, right know those are calculated by

AndroidGL20 via System.loadLibrary\r\n\r\nThis might be an artefact of the time when the AndroidGL20 class had its own native library.\r\nFrom my understanding it should not be needed anymore to call System.loadLibrary explicitly in the AndroidGL20 class.\r\n\r\nIn general this should not make problems, but when using some obfuscators (e.g. DexGuard) it would be easier if the native library is only loaded via one mechanism, i.e. GdxNativesLoader -> SharedLibraryLoader.\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\nin master (currently 1.9.7-SNAPSHOT?)\r\n\r\n#### Please
