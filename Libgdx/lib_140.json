I got a `NullPointerException`, the cause of which can be traced back to the `initiateGLInstances` method of the `LwjglGraphics` class. Because my OpenGL minor version is one less than 5 (i.e., 4), `LwjglGraphics` never instantiates gl11, and any calls to it result in a `NullPointerException`.\n\nYes, I know I need to upgrade my computer soon, when I can afford it. But the thing is, there is nothing I can see that is preventing these OpenGL 1.1 calls such as `glTexParameteri` from working on the desktop, which uses LWJGL as it's backend. In fact, I know it works because I've made these calls through LWJGL directly on the same computer with no problem.\n\nSo please tell me why LWJGL allows me to make OpenGL 1.1 calls on my macbook, but libGDX won't, when it's using LWJGL as it's desktop backend? It makes no sense.\n\nI realize there is probably some 1.5 calls used somewhere to be able to fully support ES 1.x emulation. But it doesn't seem right to nullify the entire GL11 interface because of it. Can you please enable some sort of small workaround, so maybe I can do something like:\n\n```\nif (Gdx.graphics.isDesktopGL11Available()) {\n  Gdx.gl11.glTexParameteri ...\n}\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/729","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/729/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/729/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/729/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/729","id":19527853,"number":729,"title":"Added

I tried running SimpleTest and since Box2DTest implements InputProcessor I thought I'd be all good. Inputs didn't work though and being new to libgdx it took some time to figure out what was going on.\n\nI used MyFirstTriangle example, copied over Box2DTest and SimpleTest into the project's source path and have Triangle.java extend SimpleTest. Launching the app will show the boxes animating and colliding, but inputs won't work.\n\nModifying Box2DTest.create() to call Gdx.input.setInputProcessor(this); fixes this.\n\n_Original issue: http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/issues/detail?id=122_\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/710/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/709","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/709/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/709/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/709/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/709","id":19509539,"number":709,"title":"Fade Actions on a Group to not affect their children","user":{"login":"badlogic","id":514052,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/514052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic","html_url":"https://github.com/badlogic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336980,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-09-14T20:07:45Z","updated_at":"2013-09-14T20:07:47Z","closed_at":"2013-09-14T20:07:47Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"_From [moritzp...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/110380137820502036004/) on February 05, 2011 23:08:58_\n\nWhen executing an Action on a Group like ScaleTo all the children are also effected by the Action.

We are seeing four actors forming a square with the same texture. Each texture is rotated to form a proper square with the borders. The actor in the lower left is not rotated and in its original orientation.\n\nOn the left image we see the false rendering with the x and y coordinates having a .5 value. The image on the right has rounded x and y coordinates so it does not show the error.\n\nTherefore we are probably dealing with a rounding issue.\n\nThe rendering problem does not appear on the on the android backend. I can not simply reproduce it with a simple test case but the screenshots originate from the very same code once the x value is rounded and once not.\n\n_Original issue: http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/issues/detail?id=120_\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/708/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/707","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/707/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/707/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/707/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/707","id":19509534,"number":707,"title":"The composite Actions Sequence and Parallel do not propagate the OnActionCompleted to their child Actions","user":{"login":"badlogic","id":514052,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/514052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic","html_url":"https://github.com/badlogic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336980,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true},{"id":11336985,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/wontfix","name":"wontfix","color":"ffffff","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2013-09-14T20:07:36Z","updated_at":"2013-09-14T20:07:39Z","closed_at":"2013-09-14T20:07:39Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"_From [moritzp...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/110380137820502036004/) on February 05, 2011 20:19:45_\n\nThe title says it all.\n\n_Original issue: http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/issues/detail?id=119_\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/707/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/706","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/706/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/706/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/706/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/706","id":19509533,"number":706,"title":"The Sequence and Parallel Action classes create objects when instantiated","user":{"login":"badlogic","id":514052,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/514052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic","html_url":"https://github.com/badlogic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336980,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true},{"id":11336985,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/wontfix","name":"wontfix","color":"ffffff","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2013-09-14T20:07:32Z","updated_at":"2013-09-14T20:07:35Z","closed_at":"2013-09-14T20:07:35Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"_From [moritzp...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/110380137820502036004/) on February 05, 2011 18:20:34_\n\nWhen a new Sequence or Parallel is created a varargs parameter is used to provide the subactions.
