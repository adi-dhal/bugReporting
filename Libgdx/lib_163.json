We can add an option to IOSApplicationConfiguration in the future to allow someone to take full advantage of Retina. For now, Retina devices simply return the same dimensions (called \"points\" not \"pixels\") as the non-Retina displays. On retina devices 1 point = 2 pixels (non retina: 1 point = 1 pixel).\n\nHere are the changes:\n1) getDensity() + getPPI() implemented (via help from Wikipedia)\n2) build-natives.sh fixed (no ARM6 anymore!)\n3) ALL convert.xml updated (use env.IVKM_HOME now)\n4) all 3 demo projects updated: 2 of them working, for vectorpinpall I get the following error: \"Warning: The referenced library 'gdx-backend-ios.dll' is not used from any code, skipping extraction of content resources. (gdx-vectorpinball-ios)\" - I couldn't figure out what's wrong?\n5) IOSApplicationConfiguration has now config options for LANDSCAPE/PORTRAIT\n\nIn any case, that completes your requests for iOS :)  I'll look over missing stuff in the iOS backend. Looks like properties is missing for example. Otherwise, I think it's pretty much ready to go besides the build scripts. It's going to be a pain to setup. Maybe I look into that? Anything special planned for the build scripts to make them easy to use (for others)?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/45/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/44","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/44/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/44/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/44/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/44","id":7152561,"number":44,"title":"iOS: LANDSCAPE + Sound + Music Feature Complete (/w Limitations)","user":{"login":"noblemaster","id":2363626,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2363626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/noblemaster","html_url":"https://github.com/noblemaster","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noblemaster/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noblemaster/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noblemaster/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noblemaster/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noblemaster/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noblemaster/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noblemaster/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noblemaster/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noblemaster/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2012-09-26T15:11:06Z","updated_at":"2014-06-20T12:09:24Z","closed_at":"2012-09-27T09:40:33Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/44","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/44","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/44.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/44.patch"},"body":"UPDATE 2012-09-27: (new!)\n\nOK, I updated libgdx iOS to support screen orientation changes. Both PORTRAIT + LANDSCAPE are supported.\n\nChanges:\n- IOApplication code updated\n- Invaders: converted OGG->WAV + a minor bugfix to prevent Music from being disposed\n\nLimitations: for some reason you cannot do PORTRAIT + LANDSCAPE at the same time. The screen rotates but the resulting scale is off. Right now you can do PORTRAIT/PORTRAIT_UPSIDEDOWN -or- LANDSCAPE_LEFT/LANDSCAPE_RIGHT. Mixing PORTRAIT and LANDSCAPE doesn't seem to work right!? This has been tested with the \"invaders\" demo - \"invaders\" works now in LANDSCAPE :)   Tested on Tropical Stormfront too and working.\n\n---\n\nUPDATE 2012-09-26:\n\nI managed to complete Sound and Music for iOS. I have tested with superjumper and Tropical Stormfront (got Tropical Stormfront to run :-).\n\nHere are the changes:\n- IOS Audio classes updated\n- Converted the superjumper OGG files to WAV.\n- Bugfix: FPS counter was wrong (IOSGraphics)\n\nPlease note the implementation supports WAV & MP3 (no OGG - sorry!). There is no \"pitch\" functionality for IOSSound (should be there but not in Mono!?). The rest should be to specs.\n\nI will do some testing on an actual device to make sure it's working. I noted some slowness with Tropical Stormfront but I am not sure if it is caused by the sound? superjumper was running smooth.

guys, this is Chris - you probably don't know me :)   In any case, it's not much but I spent some time to get familiar with libgdx on iOS. I created an update with support for Sound + Music. I tested it with SuperJumper and was successfully able to play the Music in the iPhone simulator.\n\nIt's far from done, but I figured I'll go ahead and post it so not several people are working on the same without knowing it.\n\nHere are the limitations:\n- no .ogg file support; works with mp3 and should also work with wav files\n- no looping yet (need to register some delegates first)\n- no soundIds yet for IOSound.java - needs more work but definitely doable\n\nI am aware OpenAL was suggested. The files I checked in use AVAudioPlayer. I can implement it all using AVAudioPlayer the only drawback is there will be no .ogg support (is there some sort of converter for .ogg to WAV/MP3?). iOS only likes to play with either WAV or MP3 files.\n\nIf we agree to defer .ogg support to later I would be able to wrap this up within the next 2 weeks (or earlier). Worry about .ogg/OpenAL later? Comments?\n\nThanks\nChris\n\nEDIT: Also, I wasn't so clear on error handling (not being able to load the audio). I guess I'll have to log an error and return null? I'll read the interface documentations for Audio.java - Sorry!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/41/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/40","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/40/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/40/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/40/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/40","id":7097746,"number":40,"title":"Some lwjgl refactoring","user":{"login":"aspic","id":788059,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/788059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspic","html_url":"https://github.com/aspic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2012-09-24T17:06:10Z","updated_at":"2014-06-20T12:01:04Z","closed_at":"2012-09-24T18:20:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/40","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/40","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/40.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/40.patch"},"body":"Fixed code formatting, added protected for coherency and replaced java.util.List.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/40/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/39","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/39/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/39/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/39/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/39","id":7071874,"number":39,"title":"Methods to get all file names in the AssetManager and to get all dependencies a asset might have","user":{"login":"Regiden","id":1666633,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1666633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Regiden","html_url":"https://github.com/Regiden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Regiden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Regiden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Regiden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Regiden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Regiden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Regiden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Regiden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Regiden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Regiden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2012-09-23T14:36:04Z","updated_at":"2014-06-20T12:05:23Z","closed_at":"2012-09-24T18:19:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/39","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/39","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/39.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/39.patch"},"body":"I've added 2 methods to retrieve the keys of all loaded assets and to get all dependencies they might have.
