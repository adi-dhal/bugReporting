To achieve this, I made particles use a local transform (position, scale, rotation). The sprite's transform is then set to the world transform of the particle, using the transform of the parent (the emitter).  Here is a [small demo](https://imgur.com/a/z9bL0).\r\n\r\nThe editor has been updated to allow for rotation and scaling of the effect.\r\n\r\nI originally planned to add rotation only, but since I was using a `Matrix3` for the parent transform, adding scale was easy. In fact, I believe this way of scaling is much simpler and works better than the current `scaleEffect` API which scales every parameter related to position/movement, and always felt more like a workaround.\r\n\r\nI know that this is a significant change, so I would understand if it can't be merged. \r\n\r\nIf it can however, please let me know if I should also push [that other commit](https://github.com/FredGithub/libgdx/commit/bc8a26fd76f1ed852349b041940c3b732782ab44), which reduces code complexity quite a bit by removing everything related to the current `scaleEffect`. Removing various public APIs (and the work of other people) is not the best though, but having 2 APIs for scaling is also not ideal. Not sure what to do at that point.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4910/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4909","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4909/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4909/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4909/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4909","id":261865015,"number":4909,"title":"Turn updatePpi, setupGL and logConfig methods protected","user":{"login":"yuripourre","id":1824878,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1824878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuripourre","html_url":"https://github.com/yuripourre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuripourre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuripourre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuripourre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuripourre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuripourre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuripourre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuripourre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuripourre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuripourre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-09-30T19:03:48Z","updated_at":"2017-09-30T19:03:48Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/4909","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4909","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4909.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4909.patch"},"body":"Hello,\r\n\r\nI am working on improvements for [https://github.com/yangweigbh/Libgdx-CardBoard-Extension](https://github.com/yangweigbh/Libgdx-CardBoard-Extension).

So if the ParticleController was moved or rotated, the TangentialAcceleration and PolarAcceleration both still acted as if the ParticleController hadn't been translated or rotated. \r\nAfter this change, if isGlobal is false, the direction of the PolarAcceleration's force is rotated when the ParticleController is and the axis about which TangentialAcceleration is applied is rotated. The particle to which the force is being applied is treated with its position relative to the ParticleController rather than relative to the origin. \r\nTangential and Polar acceleration didn't respect the global/relative setting in Flame. this fixes https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4894\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when using a controller of controllers, it is necessary to pass on the rotation information.\r\n\r\nIn order to test, I have added three tests: TangentialAccelerationTest.java, PolarAccelerationTest.java and ParticleControllerInfluencerSingleTest.java.\r\n The behavior before this change can be seen if isGlobal is set to true in either of the first two cases.

Load a music object using `Gdx.audio.newMusic`.\r\n2. Play it for several seconds. Usually at least three is enough, but more makes the effect more noticeable.\r\n3. Call `stop` on the Music object. You'll see that the result of `getPosition` is 0.0.\r\n4. Play the music again.\r\n5. By checking the result of `getPosition`, you will see that it quickly returns the old position value prior to having `stop` called, but still increases. (eg: If you stopped it at 10.0 seconds, it will return 0.0 for the first frames of music, but then return to 10.0 and keep increasing.) The actual playback of music is 100% okay, though.\r\n\r\nBelow is a runnable example. SPACE will pause/play the music, S will stop it and print the position right after. You should replace the FileHandle for the music with something appropriate.

When the ParticleEffect is at the origin, the effect gives the appearance of a tornado where the axis of the tornado is the z-axis.\r\nThe TangentialAcceleration is not set to global.\r\nIf the ParticleController is translated, the tangential acceleration is applied to the particles as if the origin is still the center of the particle effect. If the particle effect is rotated such that the axis of the tornado is no longer (parallel to) the y-axis, the tangential acceleration is still applied using the y-axis. \r\nThe desired effect is that translating or rotating the ParticleController should result in the tornado still remaining as a tornado, but that its center and orientation would change. \r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\nI've attached a file (remove the .txt extension I was forced to add for the upload and it's a valid java file) which demonstrates the issue. At lines 91 and 92, if there is no rotation or translation (comment out lines 91 and 92), then the particles look somewhat like a tornado which has its center axis aligned with the z-axis (which is where the camera is). However, if the particle controller is translated and/or rotated, the tangential acceleration is still applied. Note that isGlobal is set to false, so the expected behavior is that the acceleration would be applied with respect to the center of the particle controller, not with respect to point (0,0,0).\r\n\r\nIs this behavior intentional? If so, why does it make sense that the tangential acceleration only appears as it does in the Flame editor when the controller is unrotated and at the origin?\r\n\r\nIf not, would a reasonable fix be to store the center of the particle controller and the rotation, and apply the rotation to TMP_V3 in TangentialAcceleration.upate() and to subtract the center of the particle controller from the positionChannel values before performing the cross product?\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\nLibGDX version 1.9.6.

While loading the map everything is flipped accordingly, but there are still 2 main issues:\r\n1. There is no Hexagonal TmxMapLoader. So the mapHeightInPixels is calulcated as following:\r\n`mapHeightInPixels = mapHeight * tileHeight;`\r\nwhile it should actually be like this(taking in consideration, that hexagons are 'overlapping':\r\n`mapHeightInPixels = mapHeight == 1 ? tileHeight : ((tileWidth * 0.25f) + (((tileWidth * 0.75f) * mapHeight) + (tileHeight - tileWidth)));`\r\nThis results in MapObjects in the ObjectLayer getting wrong positions, as the original position is flipped with the wrong mapHeightInPixels.\r\n\r\n2. The staggerIndex is wrong sometimes, because the shifting along the x-Axis begins every even, or odd column starting from bottom instead the other way round as intended by Tiled.\r\nCurrent code:\r\n```\r\nfor (int row = row2 - 1; row >= row1; row--) {\r\n\t// depending on the stagger index either shift for even or uneven indexes\r\n\tif ((row % 2 == 0) == staggerIndexEven)\r\n\t\tshiftX = layerTileWidth50;\r\n\telse\r\n\t\tshiftX = 0;\r\n\tfor (int col = col1; col < col2; col++) {\r\n\t\trenderCell(layer.getCell(col, row), layerTileWidth * col + shiftX + layerOffsetX,\r\n\t\t\ttileHeightUpperCorner * row + layerOffsetY, color);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe interesting thing here is, that the cell index at layer.getCell(0, 0) now is the one at the bottom left, so it was flipped in the maploader. But the code we see here in the HexagonalTiledMapRenderer actually starts at the highest row, meaning it will start rendering the map at the top left point.\r\nSo the only thing that needs to be adjusted is instead of the line\r\n\t`if ((row % 2 == 0) == staggerIndexEven)`\r\nthe row needs to be flipped again:\r\n```\r\nint flippedRow = mapHeightInTiles - 1 - row;\r\n    if ((flippedRow % 2 == 0) == staggerIndexEven)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\n1.9.7-SNAPSHOT\r\n\r\nTiled Version: 1.0.2\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4890","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4890/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4890/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4890/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4890","id":258090475,"number":4890,"title":"MoveToAction should expose startX and startY?","user":{"login":"notsonotso","id":26680332,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/26680332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/notsonotso","html_url":"https://github.com/notsonotso","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notsonotso/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notsonotso/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notsonotso/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notsonotso/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notsonotso/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notsonotso/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notsonotso/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notsonotso/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notsonotso/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-09-15T16:07:32Z","updated_at":"2017-09-16T19:56:39Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm looping through an Actor's actions, and if it's a MoveToAction, I need to extend the X position (because I need to preserve its interpolation logic instead of creating a new action). \r\n\r\nHowever, I need to know which direction MoveToAction is going, which means it would be really convenient to call moveToAction.getStartX().

I open this ticket to maybe start a rule to remove all \"private\" & \"default\"  modifiers from the source as this greatly limit our ability to customize the classes without the need of manual copy & paste the whole class (in some cases this is not even an option).\r\n\r\nA quick example would be HorizontalGroup.computeSize() & HorizontalGroup.layoutWrapped() they both are private and I can't modify them. In this class it's possible to duplicate the whole class (but bad for future compatibility), but Label.computePrefSize() is more problematic example, Label is being used in other components such as Buttons, Tables, etc, so we can't even duplicate the class and modify it. \r\n\r\nI highly recommend marking all internal variables and methods with \"protected\" modifier. \r\n\r\nI know this may not be an \"Issue\" but I think this will reduce issues in the future and allow users to fix their issues themselves.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4883/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":1,"-1":2,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4882","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4882/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4882/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4882/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4882","id":255125842,"number":4882,"title":"GLFrameBuffer refactor","user":{"login":"Tom-Ski","id":4346114,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4346114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski","html_url":"https://github.com/Tom-Ski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-09-04T22:52:44Z","updated_at":"2017-09-04T23:04:05Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/4882","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4882","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4882.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4882.patch"},"body":"Based around comments in this PR https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/3735\r\n\r\n\r\nGLFrameBuffer exposes builders for customization of Frame Buffer Objects without the need to build a new class and manually call the gl functions.

The application launches.\r\n2. After the app has initialized, the user is presented a Game Center View where he or she is prompted to enter user credentials for Apple ID.\r\n3. After the user enter the user credentials, the apple loading indicator (the little spinning wheel) spins for a while, and then the app freezes there. There is an option to Cancel logging in to Game Center, but that doesn't respond to clicks anymore. \r\nIve attached a screenshot at the bottom of the issue to show where it hangs.\r\n\r\nI then went into settings and checked out if anything could be found about Game Center (Im running an iPhone Simulator of specs iPhone 6 / iOS 9.3 (13E230).\r\nI found that if I go into Game Center settings, I could see my email as logged in, and then I was prompted to accept the Game Center EULA.\r\n\r\nAfter I accepted that in the settings and relaunched the app, it worked fine, and I was welcomed by a Game Center dialog sliding down from the top saying \"Welcome Back Username\".\r\n\r\n**An important detail here is that the user used to log in to Game Center was completely new and had never used Game Center before.\r\nIf I try it with a user that has accepted the EULA in the iPhone Settings, then the login View dismisses correctly and everything proceeds smoothly.**\r\n\r\nSo, the user needs to be redirected to accept the EULA in some way. Is that possible? Ive seen that you can pass a completion argument to presentViewController, which I have set to null in my code if you'll have a look at the code that follows. Or is there some other way I can use to log in the user?\r\n\r\nThe main code that Im wondering about is \r\n```iOSApplication.getUIWindow().getRootViewController().presentViewController(uiViewController, false, null);```\r\nWhere Im wondering if it is possible to pass a VoidBlock as completion rather than null, which directs the user to accepting the EULA.\r\n\r\nThe full code used for authentication:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nlocalPlayer = GKLocalPlayer.getLocalPlayer();\r\nlocalPlayer.setAuthenticateHandler(new VoidBlock2<UIViewController, NSError>() {\r\n\t\t\t@Override\r\n\t\t\tpublic void invoke(UIViewController uiViewController, NSError nsError) {\r\n\t\t\t\tif(localPlayer.isAuthenticated()) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tprint(\"local player is authenticated\");\r\n\t\t\t\t\tlocalPlayer.generateIdentityVerificationSignature(new VoidBlock5<NSURL, NSData, NSData, Long, NSError>() {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t@Override\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpublic void invoke(NSURL publicKeyUrl, NSData signature, NSData salt, Long timestamp, NSError error) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t// TODO Auto-generated method stub\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t//successfully logged into gamecenter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t\t});\r\n\t\t\t\t} else if(uiViewController != null) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tiOSApplication.getUIWindow().getRootViewController().presentViewController(uiViewController, false, null);\r\n\t\t\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t//canceled by the user or GameCenter is disabled\r\n\t\t\t\t\tprint(\"not supported\");\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t});\r\n```\r\n\r\nI found this code at https://reimerm.de/2016/11/integrating-gamecenter-into-libgdx-java-multi-os-engine-8/ which is meant for multi-os-engine-8, but I managed to get it to work with a few very little tweaks.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-09-03 at 11 22 12 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1278451/30001856-9017ada0-909a-11e7-8c6f-84170622dfda.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\nlibgdx 1.9.6\r\nrobovm 2.3.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4881/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4999","x-ratelimit-reset":"1506844633","x-github-request-id":"8952:110A:24749DA:40AE072:59D091C8","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=2>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=164>; rel=\"last\"","etag":"\"eb371cbe4b1ddae1281353c468cdf2e3\"","status":"200 OK"}}
