Then I tried netbeans 8.2 (under linux). I got as far as building the project using libGDX and adding the gradle project I could execute the desktop project however not the android project. I checked and seem to have added the android sdk and plugins correctly, however I notice a red line under the android imports and the message 'package android.os does not exist'\n\nThen I get the

My created final `visualizer.jar` includes only its own compiled classes. Everything else is added to the classpath from out `/target/lib`. I start the application via the following command on linux with various JREs:\n\n```\ncd ...../target\njava -Djava.library.path=./natives -cp visualizer.jar:./lib/* org.designer.visualizer.desktop.Starter\n```\n\nIntelliJ has not problem starting the application without maven while extracting the natives to the target/classes directory.  Though, when starting via the above folder structure and the mentioned command it can't find the `libgdx64.so`.\n\nIn other words, `input` is null in `SharedLibraryLoader:125`:\n\n```\nInputStream input = SharedLibraryLoader.class.getResourceAsStream(\"/\" + path);\n\nCaused by: com.badlogic.gdx.utils.GdxRuntimeException: Unable to read file for extraction: libgdx64.so\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.utils.SharedLibraryLoader.readFile(SharedLibraryLoader.java:126)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.utils.SharedLibraryLoader.loadFile(SharedLibraryLoader.java:261)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.utils.SharedLibraryLoader.load(SharedLibraryLoader.java:115)\n```\n\nAny advice?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3079/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3078","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3078/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3078/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3078/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3078","id":72820613,"number":3078,"title":"Robot vm and gradle 2.2","user":{"login":"ydeshayes","id":3427645,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3427645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydeshayes","html_url":"https://github.com/ydeshayes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydeshayes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydeshayes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydeshayes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydeshayes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydeshayes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydeshayes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydeshayes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydeshayes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ydeshayes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-05-03T15:23:30Z","updated_at":"2015-05-09T17:39:42Z","closed_at":"2015-05-09T17:39:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I buy a new macbook so I run my project in it with new java 8 and android studio.\n\nWhen I try to run IOS project with android studio i've got an error :\n\nMacBook-Pro-de-Yann:game yanndeshayes$  ./gradlew launchIOSDevice --stacktrace\nTo honour the JVM settings for this build a new JVM will be forked.
