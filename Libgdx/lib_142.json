think it would be better when the font uses \"his\" color but doesn't touch the master blending color of the spriteBatch.\n\nThis example illustrates the problem:\n    BitmapFont font;\n    font.setColor(Color.BLACK);\n    [...]\n    spriteBatch.setColor(1.0f,1.0f,1.0f,1.0f);\n    pinfo.render(); // playerinfo, renders a sprite and a text via font\n    otherobject.render(); // I see a

When API method is not found, we can safely assume that there's no multitouch anyways.\n\nIt's sad that I did not notice this until it was too late. My game did not run for all 1.6 devices and got bad 1 star rating and > 50&#37; uninstall rate due to this. :-( Really hope those guys would come back and give our game another try before rating us crappy 1 star again. Ah well, what's done is done. At least the bug is spotted and fixed. ;-)\n\nBtw, I actually am reusing my lockless queue input patch hence I actually reverted my changes to build this patch. So it's untested but it should work.\n\n_Original issue: http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/issues/detail?id=73_\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/661/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/660","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/660/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/660/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/660/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/660","id":19509457,"number":660,"title":"Unable to decode MP3 with Mpg123Decoder","user":{"login":"badlogic","id":514052,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/514052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic","html_url":"https://github.com/badlogic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336980,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true},{"id":11336985,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/wontfix","name":"wontfix","color":"ffffff","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2013-09-14T20:04:02Z","updated_at":"2013-09-14T20:04:04Z","closed_at":"2013-09-14T20:04:04Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"_From [banthere...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/101998865455852775403/) on December 12, 2010 00:04:00_\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?

\n\nMay be bypassed simulating a 3x3 matrix with a Matrix4 object with appropiate cells filled with zeroes, but i think it's a bit overhead because this matrix must be first computed as \"worldMatrix.inv().tra()\" (from a 4x4!).\n\nThanks in advance\n\n_Original issue:
