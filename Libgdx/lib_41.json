In Blender as you can see everything is proportioned and working perfectly fine. After exporting the model without applying any parenting between the bones and the mesh everything is being displayed fine, but after I applied \"Set parent to with automatic weight\" as mentioned in the tutorial and exported the model I've got those strange skewing effects.\nWhat I've tried until now\n- recalculating normals, clear transformations, recalculating rolls, exporting as G3DJ, changing the UP direction.\n  Its not just a simple rotation. The whole mesh is somehow strangely skewed and I don't know how to fix it.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea?\nThank you!\n\n![image01](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16527359/12079615/73101dfa-b248-11e5-935c-233baaa6e327.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3688","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3688/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3688/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3688/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3688","id":124640456,"number":3688,"title":"Bullet wrapper - disable generating finalizers","user":{"login":"tukez","id":5762429,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5762429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tukez","html_url":"https://github.com/tukez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tukez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tukez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tukez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tukez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tukez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tukez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tukez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tukez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tukez/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":172870364,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/need%20more%20info","name":"need more info","color":"bfdadc","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-01-03T09:57:42Z","updated_at":"2016-01-03T15:25:13Z","closed_at":"2016-01-03T15:25:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I think SWIG generating finalizers should be disabled for the Bullet wrapper.
