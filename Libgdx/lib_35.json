are different simple filters in Photoshop widely used by digital artists:\n![untitled-1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1580663/13293026/52a1b43a-db1e-11e5-9434-cb397b77d4d8.jpg)\n\nIt would be terrific to have them in libGDX. \n\nFor example I can draw something like this in Photoshop as a game

complicated. \n\nAnother example: Hue-Saturation Photoshop layer with moving mask:

like a heavy task that brings me into the deep forest of the libGDX source-code and then farther to the GLLS-language which is way out of my area of knowledge.\n\nSo if the Photoshop filters come to libGDX, that would be great. Even if it is just a couple of them or something simple like \"make area grayscale\".\n\nThank you for your attention.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3876/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3875","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3875/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3875/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3875/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3875","id":136119982,"number":3875,"title":"Compiling Library","user":{"login":"Lolums","id":17357228,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/17357228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lolums","html_url":"https://github.com/Lolums","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lolums/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lolums/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lolums/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lolums/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lolums/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lolums/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lolums/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lolums/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lolums/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-02-24T16:53:55Z","updated_at":"2016-02-24T16:58:29Z","closed_at":"2016-02-24T16:58:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I don't know what to do with the installer GUI.

The application gets killed by the dead-lock workaround in AndroidGraphics.pause() method.\n\nI tried running a AndroidLauncher with a blank ApplicationAdapter in it (so no game whatsoever). I slide on the right to get the virtual button bar to appear and tap Home. Application is backgrounded, and after a few seconds (4 as per AndroidGraphics.pause()), the application is killed.\n\nAlso with a game with immersive and sounds/music on, backgrounding it will continue playing the sounds (until it gets killed)\n\n\"waiting for pause synchronization took too long; assuming deadlock and killing\"\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3861/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3860","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3860/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3860/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3860/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3860","id":134445164,"number":3860,"title":"Vulkan for LibGDX","user":{"login":"SonicACCEL","id":13895709,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13895709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SonicACCEL","html_url":"https://github.com/SonicACCEL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SonicACCEL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SonicACCEL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SonicACCEL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SonicACCEL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SonicACCEL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SonicACCEL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SonicACCEL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SonicACCEL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SonicACCEL/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-02-18T00:37:30Z","updated_at":"2016-02-18T01:03:32Z","closed_at":"2016-02-18T01:03:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Vulkan 1.0 was officially released yesterday \n- https://www.khronos.org/news/press/khronos-releases-vulkan-1-0-specification\n\nSome great benefits for desktop and Android ( http://www.androidauthority.com/opengl-es-3-2-vulkan-everything-to-know-632068/ )\n\nIs there a plan to implement Vulkan in LibGDX?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3860/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3859","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3859/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3859/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3859/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/3859","id":134438021,"number":3859,"title":"Updated gdx-kiwi and gdx-lml extensions versions.","user":{"login":"czyzby","id":11707612,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11707612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/czyzby","html_url":"https://github.com/czyzby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czyzby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czyzby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czyzby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czyzby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czyzby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czyzby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czyzby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czyzby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czyzby/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-02-17T23:59:34Z","updated_at":"2016-02-18T00:05:41Z","closed_at":"2016-02-18T00:05:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/3859","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/3859","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/3859.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/3859.patch"},"body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3859/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4965","x-ratelimit-reset":"1506844633","x-github-request-id":"C878:0285:102DDAD:1FBA998:59D09419","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=36>;
