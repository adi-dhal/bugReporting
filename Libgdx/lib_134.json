On iPad I'm getting black bars on top and bottom, so it works just like expected. The problem is I have some objects outside stage and they're drawing on black bars. So the next method from docs should do the work:\n\npublic void resize (int width, int height) {\n    Vector2 size = Scaling.fit.apply(800, 480, width, height);\n    int viewportX = (int)(width - size.x) / 2;\n    int viewportY = (int)(height - size.y) / 2;\n    int viewportWidth = (int)size.x;\n    int viewportHeight = (int)size.y;\n    Gdx.gl.glViewport(viewportX, viewportY, viewportWidth, viewportHeight);\n    stage.setViewport(800, 480, true, viewportX, viewportY, viewportWidth, viewportHeight);\n}\n\nBut it doesn't. The stage is drawn on the whole screen, so everything is stretched. But it looks like stage touches works only in right place and only \"visual\" stage is force to fill screen.\n\nBut If I run this on desktop and set the same dimension as iPad I'm getting black bars

This is running on the desktop with Windows 7 (64 bit).\n\nBasically, I am disposing of the music and sound resources when I switch from Area 1 to Area 2 in my game and then loading new resources for Area 2 (using the AssetManager). The crash happens when I switch back to Area 1 and reload the previously unloaded sounds and music.\n\nI modified the Drop sample project as it is easier to demonstrate the issue I have. I understand the example is not what you would normally do, but it is the easiest way to show how the problem manifests itself. \n\n1) If I run the following code with all Music objects, no problems.\n2) If I run the following code with all Sound objects, no problems.\n3) If I run the following code with the Gdx.audio.newSound uncommented (commenting out the other portion instead), works without any problems.\n\nI have used newSound() as a workaround for the Sound objects, but this isn't optimal. I have looked at examples, so it is not entirely obvious to me if I am doing something wrong.\n\n4) If I run the following code code with how it is, a mix of one Music file and a bunch of sound files using AssetManager, it crashes when it tries to play the music object with the following exception:\n\n180             rainMusic.play();       \n\nException in thread \"LWJGL Application\"
