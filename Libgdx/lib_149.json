I've splitted it up into two parts:\n\nBaseAnimationController:\nResponsible for actually applying animations. It can either apply one animation (applyAnimation), blend two animations (applyAnimations) or blend multiple animations (begin(), apply(), end()). All these methods are protected for now, but perhaps it can be useful to have a derived class exposing these methods. This class introduces a Transform class for easily maintaining and blending transforms.\n\nAnimationController:\nA slightly higher level class that extends BaseAnimationController. It introduces a AnimationDesc class to keep track of animation states etc. which are pooled using a protected pool. Basically it has four methods:\n- setAnimation: Set the current animation, without transition\n- animate: Set the current animation, blending while transition with the previous animation if needed.\n- queue: Queue an animation to be applied (using animate, thus blending) when the current animation finishes.\n- action: Apply a (short) animation (using animate, thus blending) and then blend back to the previous animation.\n  Every animation has a loopCount (number of times to play) and speed (1f for normal speed). Besides that the update(delta) can be used to alter the overall speed. The speed or delta can be negative to play animations in reverse. For debugging purposes the members (current animation, queued animation, etc.) are public for now.\n\nIt also includes an Animation3DTest which includes a skydome and concrete texture.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/450","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/450/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/450/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/450/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/450","id":15030892,"number":450,"title":"AndroidAudio uses multiple SoundPools to prevent heap size overflow","user":{"login":"WingEraser","id":292435,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/292435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WingEraser","html_url":"https://github.com/WingEraser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WingEraser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WingEraser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WingEraser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WingEraser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WingEraser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WingEraser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WingEraser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WingEraser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WingEraser/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2013-06-01T18:38:51Z","updated_at":"2014-06-17T06:51:07Z","closed_at":"2013-06-08T15:40:58Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/450","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/450","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/450.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/450.patch"},"body":"I've requested this improvement here: http://www.badlogicgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=9316&p=42143&hilit=soundpool#p42143\nBut I choose to start with it.\n\nThe changes I made:\n- Remove the SoundPool from AndroidAudio and place it in SoundPoolContainer.\n- A private class SoundPoolContainer which holds the SoundPool and checks whether the pool is full.\n- When a pool is full it creates a new SoundPoolContainer, this will prevent heap size overflow.\n- Currently the max stream is set to 15.

This is backwards compatible.\n\nThis is essential in situations where you may not always want to have an item selected (like a touch-based file browser), or where you may not want items even selectable at all (like during a tutorial).\n\nAlso this fixes a bug/defect fix where if you look in the old setSelection(String name) method, you'll see it sets the selectedIndex to -1, then tries to find an item with that name.  When it doesn't, it leaves the selectedIndex not pointing to an item, -1, which isn't intended allowable behavior in the current version.\n\n_Note_\nWhen the List is NOT selectable, it will no longer eat its touch event meaning they will still propagate down.\n\nI'm not 100% sure if that is the behavior you want versus the contrary where it eats the touch event despite not doing anything.  Regardless, I have a note of this behavior change in the setSelectable comment.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/445","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/445/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/445/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/445/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/445","id":15013249,"number":445,"title":"GestureDetector no longer consumes events.","user":{"login":"Jadems","id":4105125,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4105125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jadems","html_url":"https://github.com/Jadems","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jadems/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jadems/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jadems/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jadems/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jadems/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jadems/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jadems/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jadems/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jadems/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2013-05-31T20:45:04Z","updated_at":"2013-05-31T21:28:41Z","closed_at":"2013-05-31T21:28:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/445","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/445","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/445.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/445.patch"},"body":"Reverting a previous change of mine.
