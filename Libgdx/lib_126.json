Obviously the font doesn't have an 'o', so it will only print \"Hell\". What I want to do is load 'o' into the font at the time draw() method is called from a freetype font file or anything like that.\n\nBut why don't I load all the glyphs at once? Because there are too many. If I load all 40000+ glyphs that I need at once, it takes about 30 secs to load them all. There are glyphs that doesn't even get used once from the beginning to the end.\n\nI tried some things to make it work, but there are some internal variables inside the BitmapFont that I can't get access to. So I found that it is almost impossible without changing the source code.\n\nSo what I request is you devs should enable BitmapFont to add more glyphs when it is finished initializing. If you do, it would be a huge leap for multi-language support.

most backends there is no way to reset detlaTime... This lead to the impossibility to switch from non continuous rendering to continuous rendering when an animation is needed (specially when animating menus in scene2d.ui). For example, when setting an animation like this : \n\n``` java\nfinal TextButton button = new TextButton(\"New Game\", textButtonStyle);\nbutton.addListener(new ClickListener() {\n    public void clicked(InputEvent event, float x, float y) {\n        Gdx.app.debug(\"TestApplication\", \"button clicked\");\n        MoveToAction outAction = Actions.action(MoveToAction.class);\n        outAction.setPosition(0, 0);\n        outAction.setDuration(.5f);\n        outAction.setInterpolation(Interpolation.pow2Out);\n        button.addAction(Actions.sequence(outAction, Actions.run(new Runnable() {\n            @Override\n            public void run() {\n                Gdx.graphics.setContinuousRendering(false);\n                Gdx.graphics.requestRendering();\n            }\n        })));\n        Gdx.graphics.setContinuousRendering(true);\n    }\n});\n```\n\nWhen the button is pressed in non continous rendering, the appearence is updated but if the up event lead to the click event 1 second after the down event, the getDeltaTime() is bigger than the animation duration... so setting continuous rendering to true has no effect and the animation finished immediatelly.\n\nI would like to have a way to set the deltaTime to zero when changing to continuous rendering so that the first _new_ frame match the first frame of the animation (and not the last one) :\n- withing the setContinousRendering() method of each backend\n- with a new setDeltaTime() and setRawDeltaTime()\n\nI'm doing it with introspection wich is not really a good way but save me a lot of battery life and keep the animations.\n\nWhat do you think ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1132","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1132/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1132/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1132/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1132","id":24845972,"number":1132,"title":"AssetManager

I believe it is specified that you should not do this in the JNI docs, however, Dalvik allows this. ART is more strict and does not. Unfortunately, many JNI apps rely on this behaviour.\n\nTo gain compatibility with ART, we must make sure no calls to `NewDirectByteBuffer` are made with size 0. This will not break Dalvik compatibility.\n\nThe error originates (fairly predictably) from
