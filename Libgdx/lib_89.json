Create a Person Class that implements Agent.\n2. Add all unimplemented method stubs (update and onMessage)\n3. Create a PersonState Enum that implements State<Person> \n4. Create unimplemented method stub onMessage for PersonState\n5. Create a temporary ENUM \"FRIST_ENUM\", fill it with the overridden items (Enter, Update, Exit).\n6. Add a StateMachine to Person class.\n7. Instantiate the StateMachine with a DefaultStateMachine passing in the PersonState.FIRST_ENUM.\n8.

am coding a HUD using libGDX scene2d.ui package. I have a background texture (128*128) that I defined for the Window, effectively using it as background for my whole menu:\n\n```\n    com.badlogic.gdx.scenes.scene2d.ui.Window$WindowStyle: {\n        default: {  titleFont: default-font, background: menuTexture }\n    }\n```\n\nI do not define a background for Label, Button and other widgets, effectively using the window one. When trying to apply the same policy to SelectBox I ran into multiple problems....\n### SelectBoxStyle.background is mandatory\n\nNot defining it leads to a NPE, at least in SelectBox layout() and draw() methods.\n\nWould it be possible to make it optional? Use it only when explicitly defined?\n### The SelectBox width/height depends on background\n\nI tried setting the same background as the Window (a 128x128 texture), but the SelectBox height and width are set from the background, leading to an oversized widget. See code at lines 145-155 in SelectBox:\n\n``` java\nDrawable bg = style.background;\nBitmapFont font = style.font;\n\nprefHeight = Math.max(bg.getTopHeight() + bg.getBottomHeight() + font.getCapHeight() - font.getDescent() * 2, bg.getMinHeight());\n\nfloat maxItemWidth = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < items.size; i++)\n  maxItemWidth = Math.max(font.getBounds(items.get(i).toString()).width, maxItemWidth);\n\nprefWidth = bg.getLeftWidth() + bg.getRightWidth() + maxItemWidth;\n```\n\nShouldn't it work the other way?\n\nI would expect the widget preferred dimensions to be defined from its content, and the background image to be adjusted to these.\n### No way to set an explicitly transparent background in json skin\n\nIs there any way to define a background image in json, without creating the corresponding image in the texture atlas or other asset?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2249","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2249/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2249/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2249/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2249","id":40729986,"number":2249,"title":"DebugDrawer improved.","user":{"login":"nooone","id":5896510,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5896510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone","html_url":"https://github.com/nooone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2014-08-20T18:37:53Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T12:23:08Z","closed_at":"2014-08-20T20:55:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/2249","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2249","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2249.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2249.patch"},"body":"I have added a few more implementations to the `DebugDrawer`:\n- `reportErrorWarning`\n- `drawContactPoint`\n- `drawTriangle`\n- `draw3dText`\n\nThe `draw3dText` implementation is probably the most interesting part as it's in need of the current `glViewport` parameters, which is why I added `begin(Viewport)`. Another alternative (@Xoppa's idea) would be to keep track of the current `glViewport` paramters in a static way, for example via `Gdx.graphics.getGlViewport()`. A more slow (but maybe for debugging purposes appropriate?) way would be to just read it like this:\n\n```\nprivate static final Rectangle viewportRect = new Rectangle();\n\npublic static Rectangle getGlViewport() {\n    FloatBuffer buffer = BufferUtils.newFloatBuffer(16);\n\n    Gdx.graphics.getGL20().glGetFloatv(GL20.GL_VIEWPORT, buffer);\n    viewportRect.x = buffer.get(0);\n    viewportRect.y = buffer.get(1);\n    viewportRect.width = buffer.get(2);\n    viewportRect.height = buffer.get(3);\n\n    return viewportRect;\n}\n```\n\nIn both cases we could get rid of the `Viewport` completely here.\n\nThe way this PR draws 3D text is by projecting the destination position to the screen and then drawing it in 2D, centered on the position. This has the advantage of pixel perfection. However there are also some drawbacks:\n- Impossible to make use of the depth buffer\n- The text has always the same size, however far away it is\n\nI've tried to implement it following kalle_h's advice and draw it via the spritebatch with manipulated matrices to \"real\" 3D, however I could not make it work completely. Something must be wrong with the object matrix's rotation:\n\n```\npublic void draw3dText(Vector3 location, String textString) {\n    shapeRenderer.end();\n\n    Matrix4 lookAtMatrix = new Matrix4().setToLookAt(location, camera.position, Vector3.Y);\n    Quaternion lookAtQuaternion = new Quaternion();\n    lookAtMatrix.getRotation(lookAtQuaternion, true);\n\n    Matrix4 objectMatrix = new Matrix4();\n    objectMatrix.set(location, lookAtQuaternion);\n\n    spriteBatch.setProjectionMatrix(camera.combined);\n    spriteBatch.setTransformMatrix(objectMatrix);\n    spriteBatch.begin();\n\n    Gdx.graphics.getGL20().glEnable(GL20.GL_DEPTH_TEST);\n\n    TextBounds bounds = font.getBounds(textString);\n    font.draw(spriteBatch, textString, -bounds.width / 2, bounds.height / 2);\n\n    spriteBatch.end();\n    shapeRenderer.begin(ShapeType.Line);\n}\n```\n\nIf we could get this to work, there's no need for the `glViewport` parameters at all.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2249/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2248","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2248/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2248/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2248/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2248","id":40699351,"number":2248,"title":"Unexpected

This has been working great, until I need to implement scale.\n\nThe docs [here](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Bullet-physics) state:\n\n> Keep in mind that Bullet's transformation only supports translation (location) and rotation (orientation). Any other transformation, like scaling, is not supported.\n\nBut that is not necessarily true, you are just not supposed to scale the RigidBody itself.  The [Bullet doc](https://code.google.com/p/bullet/source/browse/trunk/Bullet_User_Manual.pdf) for version 2.82 (which I am not sure what version libgdx has included). On page 25, under the \"Static, Dynamic and Kinematic Rigid Bodies\" section you will read:\n\n> This world transform has to be a rigid body transform, which means it should contain no scaling, shear etc. If you want an object to be scaled, you can scale the collision shape.\n\nScaling a RigidBody via MotionState ModelInstance transform will \"run\", and it does produce a smaller physical object. But this object is now broken, it sporadically will collide with other objects, but the collisions will be incorrect, most of the time objects will pass right through.\n\nMy solution was to use the ModelInstance transform for rotation and orientation, and to only scale the ModelInstances nodes. Example code snippet from my ModelInstance extended class:\n\n```\npublic void applyScale(Vector3 scale){\n\n        //If scaling smaller than zero, physics break.\n        // So here we prevent that.\n        if(scale.x <= 0\n        || scale.y <= 0\n        || scale.z <= 0) {\n            return;\n        }\n\n        //We store the scale as a convenience when getScale is called\n        this.scale = scale;\n\n        //Apply the scaling to all nodes under this ModelInstance, but not this.transform.\n        for (Node node : nodes) {\n            node.scale.set(scale);\n        }\n        calculateTransforms();\n\n        //Now we apply the scaling to the Collision Shape Locally\n        body.getCollisionShape().setLocalScaling(scale);\n\n    }\n```\n\nWhereas my transforms and rotations do modify the ModelInstance transform directly:\n\n```\npublic void applyRotation(Quaternion rotation){\n        transform.set(\n            rotation.x,\n            rotation.y,\n            rotation.z,\n            rotation.w\n        );\n    }\n```\n\nThis is working, but feels a bit \"hack-ish\". It would be ideal if there was a way/abstraction to apply scale to the transform that is shared between ModelInstance and a Bullet bodys MotionState without causing major inefficiencies. Alas, at am at a loss for a better solution than what I have provided.\n\nIf there is a clear suggestion/answer with a better approach, I would love to hear it. Otherwise if the code snippet can be used in core libgdx or even in the docs to assist others, all the better.\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2241/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2240","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2240/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2240/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2240/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2240","id":40427801,"number":2240,"title":"Additional flag to fix DragAndDrop in ScrollPane","user":{"login":"nooone","id":5896510,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5896510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone","html_url":"https://github.com/nooone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2014-08-17T06:05:45Z","updated_at":"2014-08-26T20:30:31Z","closed_at":"2014-08-26T19:30:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/2240","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2240","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2240.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2240.patch"},"body":"I've noticed that it's not really possible to use `DragAndDrop` inside a `ScrollPane` currently. Since the scroll pane is higher in the hierarchy, it receives the touch down events before it could be handled by the `DragListener`. That's why usually a drag will start and after dragging the payload a little bit more, the scroll pane behaviour will kick in, scroll the pane and cancel the dragging.\n\nI've added an additional flag which will enable users to cancel the touch focus for all other listeners, but the currently active `DragListener`, in case a successful drag event has begun (payload != null). I think this is better default behaviour, but I didn't want to change the current behaviour, so it's disabled by default.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2240/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2239","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2239/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2239/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2239/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2239","id":40422200,"number":2239,"title":"FrameBuffer
