Also, I've written a `CameraMovementController`, which can be used to control the paths and run the transition animations.\n\nA `Camera` instance can be assigned with a `CameraMovementController` which then will manage the transformations.\n\n`CameraMovementController movementController = new CameraMovementController(camera);`\n\n A `CameraMovementController` will hold up to two `CameraPath` objects, one for animating the camera position and one for animating the lookAt position of that camera. To do so, the controller needs to be updated on each `render()` call:\n\n`movementController.update(Gdx.graphics.getDeltaTime());`\n\nCurrently, this allows arbitrary open or close-looped smooth paths which also allow looping a given number of times or infinitely. Also, through simply not assigning a `positionPath` or `lookAtPath` to the controller, it's possible to limit the movement on just animating the position around a fixed lookAt point or changing the lookAt position, but leaving the camera position constant. \n\nAlso, a `CameraPath` can be set to use a constant speed instead of the speed that results from the parametrization of the curve it travels along. For starting the animation of the camera position, you simply have to call the `start(...)` method on the CameraPath:\n\n`movementController.positionPath.start(20.0f, -1, true);`\n(This will start the animation of the camera position with a duration of 20 seconds for the movement, infinite looping and using a constant speed)\n\nFor demonstrating the function of the classes, I've created a new test, which basically extends the Basic3dSceneTest by animating the camera along a path.\n\n![cameramovementcontrollertest](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5558920/2870071/64312e8a-d2a9-11e3-96f1-dfcf24f4de31.png)\n\nWhen using more than one camera, the `CameraMovementController` also provides a `debugDraw(Camera)` method that uses a `ShapeRenderer` to render the paths of that controller from the view of the passed `debugCamera`. As it can be seen in the new test, this allows using some kind of overview-camera to visualize the paths of the camera.\n\nI hope you like this little enhancement. I'm sure there are some users for this, since the 3D api is getting used more and more recently. Also, I'd be happy to write a wiki entry about how to use it, if it gets merged...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1797/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1796","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1796/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1796/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1796/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1796","id":32743365,"number":1796,"title":"gdx-video ","user":{"login":"gjroelofs","id":398630,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/398630?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjroelofs","html_url":"https://github.com/gjroelofs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjroelofs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjroelofs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjroelofs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjroelofs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjroelofs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjroelofs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjroelofs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjroelofs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjroelofs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336982,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":21,"created_at":"2014-05-03T09:18:36Z","updated_at":"2014-09-07T17:07:49Z","closed_at":"2014-09-07T17:07:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/1796","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1796","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1796.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1796.patch"},"body":"Introduces a video rendering extension that works for desktop and android. It provides fullscreen Viewport driven rendering, as well as rendering to a custom Camera & Mesh.\n\nThe library currently does not yet support ios and gwt. \n\nOn android, all video formats that android supports are supported as the MediaPlayer implementation is used. \nOn desktop, ffmpeg is used, and to prevent licensing problems, we only compile with theora video support. However, this can be changed easily by changing the ffmpeg lib that is used.\n\nDuring the move to a libgdx extension, we encountered several problems:\n\nOur primary problem is that the current library loader expects a convention for naming (no version numbers, -x64). This coupled with the fact that Windows does not allow the renaming of files of compiled libraries produces some headaches when dealing with external libraries on which we have no control of the build file. To solve this problem, we introduced the SharedLibraryFinder. We place the natives jar inside the classpath (instead of the contents), and read its known location. We can iterate through the files, and regex match for the library.\n\nIf we use the build system that libgdx has, the contents of the natives jar are added directly to the classpath, which isn't iterable. A solution to this problem would be to allow iteration of (a specific part of) the classpath, as discussed in issue #1375.\n\nAnother question, is how to actually integrate the ffmpeg libs. To our understanding, there are 3 possible solutions:\n- Building ffmpeg from (downloaded) source during a build.\n- Building ffmpeg once on the server, and reusing it.\n- Having precompiled binaries inside of the repo (bad solution).\n  Currently, we use the third internally. We are currently heading for the second option, since compiling ffmpeg from scratch every build, will add a significant amount of time to the compile.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1795","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1795/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1795/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1795/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1795","id":32736274,"number":1795,"title":"Robovm OpenAL sounds not playing properly after resume","user":{"login":"AzmiTerato","id":3805042,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3805042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzmiTerato","html_url":"https://github.com/AzmiTerato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzmiTerato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzmiTerato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzmiTerato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzmiTerato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzmiTerato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzmiTerato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzmiTerato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzmiTerato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzmiTerato/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336980,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true},{"id":59604199,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/ios","name":"ios","color":"207de5","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-05-03T00:46:54Z","updated_at":"2014-05-10T21:06:01Z","closed_at":"2014-05-10T21:06:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi Team,\n\nMy game does not seem to play any sound if I pause the game (home button), then open another game (like Hearthstone), then resuming the already started game.

is very useful tool but It is heavily dependent on [gradle distribution](http://services.gradle.org/) and `mavenCentral`.\n\nIn fact,you know,the network in some country is not 'free' and fast,so it's hard to use gdx-setup and powerful gradle.\n\nI'm a developer in china,in order to use this tool,i use maven mirrors in china and use local gradle not gradle wrapper.It works well.\n\nI think maybe we can add some options in gdx-setup,such as use maven mirror not `mavenCentral`;use local gradle not gradle wrapper.\n\nIn this way,more people can enjoy new libgdx and gradle tool.\n\nAnd now most of us in china use ·gdx-setup-ui· or modify `build.gradle` manually.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1791","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1791/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1791/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1791/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1791","id":32643631,"number":1791,"title":"Add
