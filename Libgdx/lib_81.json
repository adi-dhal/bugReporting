several issues that were preventing libgdx from working with OpenGL 3.2 core profiles.\n- In core profiles glGetString(GL_EXTENSIONS) is deprecated, so a new mechanism is used to test for extensions.\n- In core profiles VAOs are mandatory, and storing vertex data in client memory is not allowed. So VertexArray and VertexBufferObject cannot be used. I've created a new VertexData implementation, VertexBufferObjectWithVAO. This is based on the VertexBufferObject code, but is uses VAOs to bind the VBO instead of setting the attributes and data for each draw call. I modified Mesh to use the new implementation when GL30 is present, and I modified the users of the \"expert\" mesh constructor to also test for this case.\n\nWith these changes SpriteBatch and Mesh function properly on my machine. No shader changes were needed.\n\nI have tested this on my windows desktop. My code uses SpriteBatch, BitmapFont, and custom meshes and shaders extensively.\n\nI have not tested on Mac, Mobile, or GWT. (I strongly suspect GWT will still not work if a 3.0 core profile is requested.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2502","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2502/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2502/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2502/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2502","id":46784893,"number":2502,"title":"Backspace in iOS with non-continuous rendering issue.","user":{"login":"rdamiano","id":2300869,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2300869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdamiano","html_url":"https://github.com/rdamiano","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdamiano/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdamiano/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdamiano/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdamiano/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdamiano/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdamiano/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdamiano/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdamiano/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdamiano/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-10-24T21:19:42Z","updated_at":"2014-10-25T12:18:38Z","closed_at":"2014-10-25T12:18:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sort of specific, but I suppose it is a bug.

This removes the sometimes unneeded copy from java array to buffer and back.\n\nOnly added the most obvious methods (genbuffer, uniformfv, etc).

contains:\n\n<pre>\n#####################\n# Here is some text #\n#####################\n</pre>\n\n\nhowever, if I initialize the TextButton and assign it to a variable:\n\n``` java\nTable table = new

the button, then it will size appropriately):\n\n<pre>\n ###############\nHere is some text\n ###############\n</pre>\n\n\nI originally found similar behavior in v1.1.0, but am seeing the same issue
