I believe it may be an issue with libgdx, as I've read a few different articles and gdx forum posts to the right approach for instantiating and rendering ```BitmapFont``` objects in GDX and tried many different variations on the recommendations.  I apologize if this is either a known issue or not the recommended usage.  Thank you for the great library.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\n* Run latest (as of issue date) gdxsetup.jar (GDX 1.9.5) with default settings with desktop/html selected.\r\n* In ```MyGdxGame```, add a field for a ```BitmapFont font``` and add the following to the ```create``` method:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n                Gdx.app.setLogLevel(Application.LOG_DEBUG);\r\n                Gdx.app.debug(\"Test\", Gdx.files.internal(\"arial-15.fnt\").readString());\r\n                font = new BitmapFont(\r\n                        Gdx.files.internal(\"arial-15.fnt\"),\r\n                        Gdx.files.internal(\"arial-15.png\"), false, true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Copy the arial-15.fnt and arial-15.png files out of the gdx lib into the assets folder.\r\n* Set a working directory to run from the assets folder, see the ```DesktopLauncher.main``` and see that it executes correctly, showing the font rendered and the contents of arial-15.fnt displayed in the console.\r\n\r\n![screenshot from 2016-12-14 13-23-21](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/672163/21195129/83737af2-c200-11e6-9523-20c71cc5a191.png)\r\n\r\n* run ```gradlew html:dist```, used python SimpleHTTPServer to serve from the ```html/build/dist``` directory\r\n* get a caught exception about inability to read the ```BitmapFont```.\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\n\r\nGDX 1.9.5 with all defaults versions set from the gdxsetup.jar.  I've tried with Java 1.7 and 1.8, both oracle and openjdk on windows 7, centos, and ubuntu.  Results copied were with OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_31-b13) and centos.\r\n\r\n#### Stacktrace\r\nYou get the following caught exception, though the web server log indicates the font files served up and the log content showing the file *.fnt contents were successfully read.\r\n\r\n![screenshot from 2016-12-14

That is, the actual pixel size of the font the png uses.\r\nThe font class provides all manor of methods to get various font aspects (CapHeight, Decent,Ascent etc). But I cant find any that return the font size itself, and calculating font size from the other aspects is confusing at best.\r\nTo be clear as I can the information is in the *.fnt file right at the start;\r\neg.\r\n`...info face=\"Calibri Light\" size=32 bold=0 italic=0 charset=\"\"...\r\n`\r\nIts that \"32\" I am after.\r\nIt would be nice if there was a simple  font.getNativeSize(), or similar to retrieve it.

The lineheight seems to match the fontsize by default - but as it can be changed I need to populate a hashmap on loading associating the initial values with their fonts. Then use that hasmap when I need to get the native font size.\r\nIt works, but feels very hack-ish so it would be nice if at somepoint libgdx had a more direct method.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4482/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4481","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4481/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4481/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4481/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4481","id":195265065,"number":4481,"title":"How to put the Desktop project into a jplane","user":{"login":"whitecostume","id":10680112,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10680112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitecostume","html_url":"https://github.com/whitecostume","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitecostume/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitecostume/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitecostume/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitecostume/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitecostume/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitecostume/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitecostume/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitecostume/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitecostume/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-12-13T14:20:46Z","updated_at":"2016-12-13T19:14:55Z","closed_at":"2016-12-13T19:14:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Because I want to make a plugin of IDEA,so how to put the Desktop project into a jplane?\r\nthanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4481/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4480","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4480/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4480/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4480/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4480","id":195242261,"number":4480,"title":"TextArea.setAlignment is not working","user":{"login":"SamehMahmoud","id":8081393,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8081393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamehMahmoud","html_url":"https://github.com/SamehMahmoud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamehMahmoud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamehMahmoud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamehMahmoud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamehMahmoud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamehMahmoud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamehMahmoud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamehMahmoud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamehMahmoud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamehMahmoud/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":172870364,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/need%20more%20info","name":"need more info","color":"bfdadc","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-12-13T12:37:05Z","updated_at":"2016-12-13T19:15:37Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"#### Issue details\r\nsetAlignment is not effecting text area alignment at all !

there is a method called  **setText** in **GlyphLayout.java** \r\n\r\npublic void **setText**(BitmapFont font, CharSequence str, int start, int end, Color color, float targetWidth, int halign, boolean

In fact, If I remove google play services&Firebase ads and other big dependencies my app will work well.\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\nlibgdx 1.9.4\r\ngradle-2.2\r\ncom.android.tools.build:gradle:1.5.0\r\nbuildToolsVersion \"23.0.3\"\r\ncom.google.firebase:firebase-crash:10.0.1\r\n\r\n#### Stacktrace\r\nOn one of devices:\r\n```\r\n12-08 00:10:23.875 24391-24391/?

This allows to have fewer bind and draw calls when drawing regions from huge multi-page atlases.\r\n\r\nThey require OpenGL [ES] 3+, because TextureArray requires OpenGL [ES] 3+.\r\n\r\nThings that do not work yet:\r\n\r\n * Generation of mipmaps\r\n * Loading of [Z]KTX files into TextureArray, neither from separate files nor from single file.\r\n\r\nThings that do work right now:\r\n\r\n * Creation of `TextureArrayAtlas` from regular `.atlas` files which reference PNG images. Images MUST be of same size, this can be enforced in TexturePacker config.\r\n * Drawing `TextureArrayAtlas.ArrayAtlasRegion` instances with `ArrayRegionBatch`.\r\n\r\nI omitted many `draw` call overloads in batch implementation, they can be added later if needed.\r\n\r\nI also made a simple test for this stuff which works (tested on two different OS X machines, one with Nvidia, one with AMD) but it's written in Kotlin, should I port it to Java or what do I do?\r\n\r\nAlso, there's obviously a lot of code duplication against existing libgdx code files, I didn't make any attempts to solve that yet, but when the time comes to merge this work, it should probably be done to some extent too.\r\n\r\nAlso some code comments left from original files are probably off. In that case they need to be corrected or deleted.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4465/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4464","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4464/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4464/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4464/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4464","id":193904928,"number":4464,"title":"Improvements to barycentric methods in GeometryUtils","user":{"login":"Heerbann","id":18620323,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/18620323?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Heerbann","html_url":"https://github.com/Heerbann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Heerbann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Heerbann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Heerbann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Heerbann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Heerbann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Heerbann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Heerbann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Heerbann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Heerbann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-12-06T22:33:46Z","updated_at":"2016-12-11T00:17:56Z","closed_at":"2016-12-08T15:15:21Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/4464","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4464","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4464.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4464.patch"},"body":"I adapted this from the book Realtime Collision Detection by Christen Ericson (http://realtimecollisiondetection.net/) and this thread https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/23743/whats-the-most-efficient-way-to-find-barycentric-coordinates\r\nin theory this should work but my math might be off or even made a conceptual error. \r\nFurthermore, the caching might be an overkill for 99% of the use cases.
