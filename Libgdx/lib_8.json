If you continue to hold down the left shift key, but click outside of the application window so that the app goes into the background, and then release the key, the keyUp event will be missed and there will be no log output.  If you then bring the application into the foreground again, and press the left shift key down and then up, the keyDown event will be missed and you'll only get a keyUp event.

Unless the `renderObject `method is implemented by the program, the `renderObject` method is completely empty, and therefore useless. In the end, this foreach loop will be called on every rendering tick if the map contains any object layers. This means that there is a possible performance hit as well as a possible extra battery drain when using multiple object layers on lower end mobile devices.\r\n\r\nI fully understand that this call was implemented so that the programmers can simply hook up to the `renderObject` method, without having to worry to see if this is called or not.\r\n\r\n#### Potential solutions\r\n\r\nThe solution I have found to this is to implement the `renderObjects` method with an empty body, to avoid having to execute the entire foreach loop. It is also possible to use the `render(int[])` method, and only pass in the indexes of graphics layers.\r\n\r\nHowever, I feel like it would be a good idea to add some documentation on the matter, to help programmers optimizing their render loops when using heavily populated object layers.\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\nLatest version as of 2017-04-09\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4685/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4684","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4684/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4684/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4684/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4684","id":220163128,"number":4684,"title":"Android Device Crashes while calling .tmx file image for game","user":{"login":"Nisi123","id":27004691,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/27004691?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nisi123","html_url":"https://github.com/Nisi123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nisi123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nisi123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nisi123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nisi123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nisi123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nisi123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nisi123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nisi123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nisi123/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-04-07T09:42:11Z","updated_at":"2017-04-07T11:57:08Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I am trying to make a game and using .tmx file format. testing on window works fine but testing on android device it crashes and give message \"unfortunately, your game has stopped working\".

Issue details\r\n\r\nWhen restarting a game in the same JVM process, the window size is not set correctly. By restarting a game, I mean that I click the X in the top right corner, and then create a new instance of my `LwjglApplication`. The window size is not the same the second time. The third time, it's back to the correct size, and it keeps cycling between the correct size and the incorrect size if I keep restarting the game. Here is a video demonstrating the behavior: https://pix.asidik.com/tomski-W4Ucru.mp4\r\n\r\nIf the window size is set in the `LwjglApplicationConfig` passed to `LwjglApplication`, then the second time the game starts, the window is as large as the monitor.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\n\r\nI'm programming in Clojure (that is the reason I want to be able to restart the game in the same JVM), and I don't have a development environment set up for Java.
