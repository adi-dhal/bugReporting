If the background of the ProgressBar is a NinePatchDrawable, the _knobBefore_ Drawable is not drawn over the unresizable parts of the background. I think it should be.  \n   In the image, the green fill is the _knobBefore_. Both the background and _knobBefore_ are NinePatchDrawables. To my knowledge, it is not possible to draw the _knobBefore_ from the very bottom to the very top of the ProgressBar, making a filling ProgressBar impossible unless you don't use a NinePatch as background. No NinePatch would mean round edges are always stretched over the whole ProgressBar though. So in effect you have to choose between either a filling ProgressBar with no round edges or a ProgressBar with round edges but ugly _knobBefore_.  \n   If the _knobBefore_ was drawn over the unresizable parts of the NinePatch background as well, this wouldn't be a problem. If the user doesn't want it to be drawn over these parts he could use a NinePatch _knobBefore_ with transparent parts, so no functionality is lost but only new added.  \n   This is of course also the case regarding _knobAfter_ which should go from the _knob_ to the very end of the ProgressBar, not just to the end of the resizable/inner part of the _background_ NinePatch.\n2. The green rectangle is the actual size of the ProgressBar, set with  `bar.setWidth(200); bar.setHeight(500);`. Vertical ProgressBars only adjust to their height, horizontal ProgressBars only adjust to their width. In my opinion the user should be able to size them theirselves instead of being forced to have them look 140 pixels wide/tall regardless of their actual size.\n\nWhat do you think about these suggestions?\n\n_especially adressing ProgressBar authors @badlogic and @NathanSweet_\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3046/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3045","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3045/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3045/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3045/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3045","id":70402903,"number":3045,"title":"Label setAlignment(Align.center) doesn't work properly with setEllipsis(true)","user":{"login":"geertjan-apptornado","id":5756227,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5756227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjan-apptornado","html_url":"https://github.com/geertjan-apptornado","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjan-apptornado/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjan-apptornado/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjan-apptornado/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjan-apptornado/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjan-apptornado/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjan-apptornado/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjan-apptornado/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjan-apptornado/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjan-apptornado/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-04-23T12:43:18Z","updated_at":"2015-04-24T01:42:56Z","closed_at":"2015-04-24T01:42:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When on a Label you set both `setAlignment(Align.center)` and `setEllipsis(true)`, the alignment is broken when the text doesn't fit.\n#### Expected behaviour\n\nWhen text fits:\n\n```\n    +--------+\n    |  1234  |\n    +--------+\n```\n\nWhen text doesn't fit:\n\n```\n    +--------+\n    |12345...|\n    +--------+\n```\n#### Actual behavior (libGDX 1.5.6)\n\nWhen text fits:\n\n```\n    +--------+\n    |  1234  |\n    +--------+\n```\n\nWhen text doesn't fit:\n\n```\n    +--------+\n 12345...    |\n    +--------+\n```\n\nIf you use `setAlignment(Align.right)` you get similar incorrect behavior.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3044","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3044/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3044/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3044/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3044","id":70391372,"number":3044,"title":"Strange issue with Assetloader & TextureAtlas","user":{"login":"voidstarfire","id":6940726,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6940726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/voidstarfire","html_url":"https://github.com/voidstarfire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voidstarfire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voidstarfire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voidstarfire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voidstarfire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voidstarfire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voidstarfire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voidstarfire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voidstarfire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voidstarfire/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":19,"created_at":"2015-04-23T11:42:38Z","updated_at":"2015-05-19T08:36:30Z","closed_at":"2015-05-19T08:36:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I've noticed that some of my graphics/textures are black squares when I compile my app for iOS (Device & Simulator).

stumbled across an error when wrapping the text of labels.  It's due to a floating point error in GlyphLayout, so is extremely sensitive to its input, but the following code should reproduce it:\n\n```\npublic class FontWrapIssue extends ApplicationAdapter {\n\n    private static final float GAME_WIDTH = 230.4f;\n\n    private Stage stage;\n\n    @Override\n    public void create () {\n        float gameScale = GAME_WIDTH / Gdx.graphics.getWidth();\n        int gameHeight = (int) (Gdx.graphics.getHeight() * gameScale + 0.5);\n        stage = new Stage(new FitViewport(GAME_WIDTH, gameHeight));\n        Gdx.input.setInputProcessor(stage);\n        resize(Gdx.graphics.getWidth(), Gdx.graphics.getHeight());\n        FreeTypeFontGenerator generator = new FreeTypeFontGenerator(Gdx.files.internal(\"data/arial.ttf\"));\n        FreeTypeFontGenerator.FreeTypeFontParameter parameter = new FreeTypeFontGenerator.FreeTypeFontParameter();\n        parameter.size = (int) (20 / gameScale + 0.5);\n        BitmapFont font = generator.generateFont(parameter);\n        font.getData().setScale(gameScale);\n        Label.LabelStyle labelStyle = new Label.LabelStyle();\n        labelStyle.font = font;\n        labelStyle.fontColor = Color.WHITE;\n        String text = \"test with wHVVVl wHVVVl issue\";\n        Table table = new Table();\n        table.setFillParent(true);\n        addLabel(table, text, labelStyle);\n        stage.addActor(table);\n        table.debug();\n    }\n\n    private void addLabel(Table table, String text, Label.LabelStyle labelStyle) {\n        Label label = new Label(text, labelStyle);\n        label.setWrap(true);\n        table.add(label).fillX().expandX().row();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void render () {\n        Gdx.gl.glClearColor(0, 0, 0, 1);\n        Gdx.gl.glClear(GL20.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);\n        stage.act(Gdx.graphics.getDeltaTime());\n        stage.draw();\n    }\n\n    public static void main (String[] args) throws Exception {\n        new LwjglApplication(new FontWrapIssue());\n    }\n}\n```\n\nScreenshot where you can see the text wrapping outside the Label's boundary:\n![fontwrapissue](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1848870/7227694/01420e9a-e796-11e4-8cea-50c7f741d945.png)\n\nThe floating point error occurs when the glyphRun is wrapped (in version 1.5.6, `GlyphLayout.java` lines 287-288 and the loop at 297).  To work out the the width of the wrapped run, the code calculates backwards from the current position by subtracting the xAdvances of the glyphs that overshot the desired width (including any white space).  However, due to floating point rounding errors the result can occasionally be slightly smaller than the result of summing all the xAdvances of the glyphs leading up to the wrap point (i.e. we have `x + w1 + w2 + ...  - w1 - w2 - ...` giving a result different from x).\n\nThat error alone would just result in the text wrapping in the wrong place.  The reason the text of the `Label` goes outside its boundary is because the code in `Label.computeSize()` that calculates the bounds of the label always uses the actor's width as the targetWidth passed to `layout.setText()`, so it doesn't care about the error in the run length.  The code in `Label.layout()` however calculates the targetWidth based on the computed bounds, which will be fractionally too narrow in the case when this floating point error occurs.  IMHO, `Label.layout()` should always use a targetWidth that matches whatever `Label.computeSize()` uses (for wrapped text at least), so there is never a discrepancy.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3035/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3034","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3034/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3034/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3034/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3034","id":69534468,"number":3034,"title":"After update to 1.5.6 Align.center (wrap) works incorrectly","user":{"login":"StanDem","id":12011951,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/12011951?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StanDem","html_url":"https://github.com/StanDem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StanDem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StanDem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StanDem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StanDem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StanDem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StanDem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StanDem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StanDem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StanDem/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-04-20T08:22:09Z","updated_at":"2015-04-21T02:48:08Z","closed_at":"2015-04-21T02:48:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"![2015-04-20 11 18 43](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12011951/7226214/56df01ba-e74f-11e4-9383-b3e66ec221c5.png)\n\nHere is the code:\n\n```\n    shapeRenderer.begin(ShapeRenderer.ShapeType.Line);\n    shapeRenderer.setColor(0, 1, 0, 1);\n    shapeRenderer.rect(10, 10, 346, 500);\n    shapeRenderer.end();\n\n    batch.begin();\n    font.getData().setScale(3);\n    layout.setText(font, \"Welcome to your new job!\", font.getColor(), 346, Align.center, true);\n    font.draw(batch, layout, 10, 10 + (500 / 2 + layout.height / 2));\n    batch.end();\n```\n\nAs you can see the last letter doesn't fit.

It tries to serialize `java.util.Map`, `com.badlogic.gdx.utils.ArrayMap` and `com.badlogic.gdx.utils.ObjectMap` in special ways.\n\nAs always with the libgdx collection framework, there are more classes that are not covered in a generic way (like `ObjectIntMap` for example). I guess that's a problem that cannot be solved though.\n\nHowever, it's good that at least some standard classes are covered. On the other hand, they are serialized in a pretty weird way. It looks like the map entries are serialized as fields with \"key=value\". If I saw it right, it's possible to configure the value type serialization by setting the `elementType`. It's not possible though to change how the keys are serialized. The keys are just converted to a string as the fields name ([code](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/utils/Json.java#L516)).\n\nThat works sometimes (in case there is a simple String representation, like for Enum, Integer, String itself etc). However they are also read back as Strings, since there is no way for Json to know which type is expected (because of type erasure).\n\nA simple example:\n\n```\nObjectMap<Integer, Integer> numbers = new ObjectMap<Integer, Integer>();\nnumbers.put(10, 5);\nString jsonString = json.toJson(numbers);\nSystem.out.println(jsonString);\nnumbers = json.fromJson(ObjectMap.class, jsonString);\nSystem.out.println(numbers);\nSystem.out.println(numbers.get(10));\n```\n\nWill result in this:\n\n```\n{10:{class:java.lang.Integer,value:5}}\n{10=5}\nnull\n```\n\nThat last `null` is unexpected. That's because in our `ObjectMap<Integer, Integer>`, we now have a _`String`_ key instead of `Integer`. Type erasure at work.\n\nI'd suggest to change the current serialization to actually serialize the entries of the map as an array of entries instead of key=value fields.\n\n[Here](http://pastebin.com/0h5yVNdU) is an implementation of a `ObjectMapSerializer` which makes use of that approach and is able to serialize and deserialize the maps correctly.\n\nI think this is a much better way of doing it. If you agree, I'll try to make a PR for that.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3030/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3029","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3029/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3029/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3029/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3029","id":69158156,"number":3029,"title":"Some PNG files fail to load correctly in Gdx2dPixmap","user":{"login":"david-springer","id":1126052,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1126052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-springer","html_url":"https://github.com/david-springer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-springer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-springer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-springer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-springer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-springer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-springer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-springer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-springer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-springer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-04-17T15:16:59Z","updated_at":"2015-04-17T16:56:44Z","closed_at":"2015-04-17T16:56:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Loading any PNG that is not RGBA results in corrupted Gdx2dPixmap data (see attached).\n\nCode used to load the pixmap (and create the raw RGB file I used to make the attached .png):\n        try {\n          final FileHandle hfile = Preconditions.checkNotNull(getFileHandle(assetPath));\n          byte[] bytes = hfile.readBytes();\n          Gdx2DPixmap pm = new Gdx2DPixmap(bytes, 0, bytes.length, 0);\n          // Note: if you inspect the DirectByteBuffer memory for pm.getPixels() at this point\n          // you will notice that it has corrupted samples.\n          File outFile = new File(\"particle_gdx2dpixmap.rgb\");\n          FileChannel out = new FileOutputStream(outFile, false).getChannel();\n          out.write(pm.getPixels());\n          out.close();\n      }\n\nThe resulting pixmap has '255' values inserted every fourth byte, even though it's RGB and not RGBA.\n\nlibGDX version 1.5.5.\n\nOriginal .png file:\n![particle](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1126052/7204708/3b46b9a2-e4d9-11e4-96de-1ea1037946e3.png)\n\nResulting RGB file (as a .png).

I called the constructor of ParticleSystem manually and then it works.\n\nI suggest removing the Singleton pattern and force the user to manually instantiate the ParticleSystem class to be able to use it.\n\nregards,\nAlain\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4937","x-ratelimit-reset":"1506844633","x-github-request-id":"8494:028B:DE02F6:2EC82AE:59D094FE","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=64>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=164>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=62>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"875f4dcf14d84f766396169729abc9da\"","status":"200 OK"}}
