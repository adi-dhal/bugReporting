easier than can be downloaded here:\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7OWuDw42TLSQi1pQ0p0RXFSRVU/view?usp=sharing\n\nThe project is basically a simple music player with a play, pause, stop and a \"play from second 30\" buttons.\n\nIt includes a backend-android jar with the fix and it's easy to switch between default and the fix version from the android dependencies in the build.gradle file.\n\nIssues will most probably appear on Nu Player devices where the \"play from second 30\" (that uses the setPosition() method) doesn't work after the first time. Just playing around, pausing, playing, playing from 30 and stopping the inconsistent behaviours should manifest on the non fixed

If you look at the code, you'll see that it starts at the bottom left (`fx, fy`), then to the top left (`fx, fy + height`) and then to the top right (`fx + width, fy + height`), and so on. This will cause everything to be culled when back face culling is enabled. It is easy to reproduce, in any of the tests enable backface culling:\n\n``` java\nGdx.gl.glEnable(GL20.GL_CULL_FACE);\n```\n\nEither switching to frontface culling (`Gdx.gl.glCullFace(GL20.GL_FRONT);`) or switching to clockwise winding (`Gdx.gl.glFrontFace(GL20.GL_CW);`) will make it appear again.\n\nI noticed this when using the vertices of the `Sprite` class (to benefit from `AtlasSprite`) as base for a 3d surface. So it is not only `SpriteBatch`.\n\nAlthough easy to fix, I'm not sure what the impact of it would be.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3576","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3576/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3576/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3576/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/3576","id":117584279,"number":3576,"title":"Add

Support for this will be removed in a future release. Also, this makes the host incompatible with version 3 audio units. Please transition to the API's in AudioComponent.h.\"\n\nThis is an OpenAL-Soft issue, [which has already been fixed](https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft/issues/20). According to [this thread in LWJGL forums](http://forum.lwjgl.org/index.php?topic=5994.0), for updating LWJGL2 apps \"it should just be matter of dropping the latest openal-soft natives (which you can grab them from the nightly builds of LWJGL3) over the old natives\".

There's a tool for removing files from old commits, though, called [BFG](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/).  It's supposed to be far easier to use than Git's built-in tools for cleaning up history.  Has anyone looked into that?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3564","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3564/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3564/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3564/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/3564","id":116991856,"number":3564,"title":"Fix to set first and last glyphs in a glyph run to the correct width","user":{"login":"hyvas","id":2769000,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2769000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas","html_url":"https://github.com/hyvas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-11-15T13:07:43Z","updated_at":"2015-11-23T11:07:14Z","closed_at":"2015-11-23T11:07:14Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/3564","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/3564","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/3564.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/3564.patch"},"body":"when using setFixedWidthGlyphs() -

On all these devices, the color values appear like the screenshot below:\n\n![correct](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9423063/11161959/86fc6316-8a41-11e5-92fd-3aa402da3ddf.png)\n\nHowever, on an actual iOS device, the colors appear like the following image:\n\n![incorrect](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9423063/11161961/9c95c8de-8a41-11e5-81b0-59a9bd18c682.png)\n\nI tested the app on multiple iOS devices running different versions of iOS (8 and 9), and it still appeared like the second, incorrect image. \n\nI tried to edit the color and depth formats in the IOSApplicationConfiguration to no avail, and tried all combination of the two. I also looked at the documentation for any pList attributes that may be causing the bug, but I found nothing of relevance. What could be a possible explanation to this error?\n\nThe project was first generated using the LibGDX Eclipse project generation utility back when LibGDX was still in version 1.5, and RoboVM was still in Beta. The projects have been converted to Gradle projects using the Eclipse Gradle plugin, and I am compiling the project using the Eclipse RoboVM plugin. Hopefully this information helps. I will provide code snippets of any part of my code if asked.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3562/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3561","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3561/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3561/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3561/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3561","id":116692500,"number":3561,"title":"creating
