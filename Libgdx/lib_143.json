Load attached code into Eclipse\n2.  Right click Project->Run As->Java Application\n3.  Hold W (or any other key). What is the expected output? What do you see instead? The log should say only \"MultipleController: ControllerA.keyUp 51\" repeatedly.  Instead it says \"MultipleController: ControllerA.keyUp 51\\nMultipleController: ControllerA.keyDown 51\" What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? 0.8 on Ubuntu Linux 10.04 Please provide any additional information below. The project is named MultipleController because I thought the bug only applied when using InputMultiplexer, but on closer inspection just one InputProcessor was enough to manifest the bug.\n\n_Original issue: http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/issues/detail?id=57_\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/645/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/644","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/644/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/644/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/644/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/644","id":19509428,"number":644,"title":"[Linux] Error: Couldn't create Music instance from file","user":{"login":"badlogic","id":514052,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/514052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic","html_url":"https://github.com/badlogic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336980,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":13,"created_at":"2013-09-14T20:02:36Z","updated_at":"2013-09-14T20:02:46Z","closed_at":"2013-09-14T20:02:46Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"_From [jason.mi...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/106887767399886217639/) on November 06, 2010 04:03:27_\n\nThis started happening about a week ago:\n\nException in thread \"Thread-3\" javax.media.opengl.GLException: com.badlogic.gdx.utils.GdxRuntimeException: Couldn't create Music instance from file 'data/8.12.mp3'\n    at javax.media.opengl.Threading.invokeOnOpenGLThread(Threading.java:271)\n    at javax.media.opengl.GLCanvas.maybeDoSingleThreadedWorkaround(GLCanvas.java:410)\n    at javax.media.opengl.GLCanvas.display(GLCanvas.java:244)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.backends.jogl.JoglAnimator.display(Unknown Source)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.backends.jogl.JoglAnimator$MainLoop.run(Unknown Source)\n    at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:662)\nCaused by: com.badlogic.gdx.utils.GdxRuntimeException: Couldn't create Music instance from file 'data/8.12.mp3'\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.backends.jogl.JoglAudio.newMusic(Unknown Source)\n    at com.badlogic.gdxinvaders.GdxInvaders.create(GdxInvaders.java:79)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.backends.jogl.JoglGraphics.init(Unknown Source)\n    at com.sun.opengl.impl.GLDrawableHelper.init(GLDrawableHelper.java:72)\n    at javax.media.opengl.GLCanvas$InitAction.run(GLCanvas.java:418)\n    at com.sun.opengl.impl.GLDrawableHelper.invokeGL(GLDrawableHelper.java:189)\n    at javax.media.opengl.GLCanvas$DisplayOnEventDispatchThreadAction.run(GLCanvas.java:452)\n    at java.awt.event.InvocationEvent.dispatch(InvocationEvent.java:199)\n    at java.awt.EventQueue.dispatchEvent(EventQueue.java:597)\n    at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpOneEventForFilters(EventDispatchThread.java:269)\n    at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEventsForFilter(EventDispatchThread.java:184)\n    at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEventsForHierarchy(EventDispatchThread.java:174)\n    at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEvents(EventDispatchThread.java:169)\n    at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEvents(EventDispatchThread.java:161)\n    at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.run(EventDispatchThread.java:122)\nCaused by: javax.sound.sampled.LineUnavailableException: line with format PCM_SIGNED 44100.0 Hz, 16 bit, stereo, 4 bytes/frame, little-endian not supported.\n    at com.sun.media.sound.DirectAudioDevice$DirectDL.implOpen(DirectAudioDevice.java:494)\n    at com.sun.media.sound.AbstractDataLine.open(AbstractDataLine.java:107)\n    at com.sun.media.sound.AbstractDataLine.open(AbstractDataLine.java:139)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.backends.jogl.JoglMusic.<init>(Unknown Source)\n    ... 15 more\n\nI can load and play the file as background music with the other sounds playing if I use the Sound class instead of Music.

Set a matrix using Matrix.setToWorld with sensible position, direction and up vectors\ne.g. mWorldMatrix.setToWorld(mWorldPos, mWorldDir, new Vector3(0, 1.f, 0)); \n2. Send the matrix to openGL for a modelview transform, e.g.\ngl.glLoadMatrixf(mWorldMatrix.getValues(), 0);\n3. Do a render What is the expected output? What do you see instead? Expected output: the model renders according to the transform as if you used glTranslateF and glRotateF with the individual vectors\n\nOutput: stretchy matrix gone wrong! What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? 0.61 Please provide any additional information below. The problem is Matrix.getValues returns the floats in a column order incompatible with OpenGL. OpenGL expects matrices to be serialized in \"major column order\". The following code demonstrates a hack to fix it:\n\n```\n    float[] vals = new float[16];\n    vals = mWorldMatrix.getValues();\n    vals[12] = vals[3]; vals[3] = 0;\n    vals[13] = vals[7]; vals[7] = 0;\n    vals[14] = vals[11]; vals[11] = 0;\n    g.glLoadMatrixf(vals, 0);\n```\n\nIf I've done something stupid let me know - it's been years since I've done any OpenGL and I'm still remembering how everything works!\n\n_Original issue: http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/issues/detail?id=48_\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/636/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/635","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/635/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/635/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/635/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/635","id":19509414,"number":635,"title":"Be able to use back button on android to navigate game","user":{"login":"badlogic","id":514052,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/514052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic","html_url":"https://github.com/badlogic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2013-09-14T20:02:00Z","updated_at":"2013-09-14T20:02:03Z","closed_at":"2013-09-14T20:02:03Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"_From [erinthom...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/115554158040412663779/) on October 09, 2010 18:05:01_\n\nI would like to be able to use the back button to navigate inside the game.

The equivalent methods to localPosition in JBox2D are missing in the JNI wrapper. I think they should be in PolygonShape or CircleShape. In the CircleShape there is a method called setPosition that seems to be OK, but there is no equivalent method in PolygonShape.\n2. In the same scope, there is a missing method also in the Fixture class to be able to read his position in the case of a body with many shapes.\n\nI.e: lets say we have an compound body with 2 shapes or fixtures. Using the method getFixtureList I can have access to all the fixtures in the body, but not to their positions. I just can have access to the position of the body where they belongs, but not the Fixture position, hence I can not render them.\n\n  for(Fixture f: myBody.getFixtureList())  \n  {\n     f.getBody().getPosition(); // position of the body, but it \n                                //is not what I need right now\n                                // I just need the position of the  \n                                // shape/fixture\n  } What is the expected output? What do you see instead? I expect the same output as in the JBox2d example http://www.jbox2d.org/demos/compoundshapes.html What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? Android 2.1 Please provide any additional information below. Thank you very much. I hope I didnt miss something and Im clear enough.\n\n_Original issue: http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/issues/detail?id=31_\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/618","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/618/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/618/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/618/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/618","id":19509380,"number":618,"title":"Library 'libhgl.so' not found","user":{"login":"badlogic","id":514052,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/514052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic","html_url":"https://github.com/badlogic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336980,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2013-09-14T20:00:49Z","updated_at":"2013-09-14T20:00:52Z","closed_at":"2013-09-14T20:00:52Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"_From [tom....@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/103579800128841717107/) on July 21, 2010 21:38:12_\n\nI used the helloworld project and added the project on the android 1.6 emulator.

Isn't that kind of redundant since the Graphics object is always a singleton in a libgdx game?\n\n2, there is a convenience function: public void getScreenToWorld( float screenX, float screenY, Vector2 world ) besides the usual: public float getScreenToWorldX( float screenX ) and public int getWorldToScreenX( float worldX ). But there isn't a corresponding getWorldToScreen( float screenX, float screenY, Vector2 world )\n\n_Original issue: http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/issues/detail?id=28_\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/616/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4855","x-ratelimit-reset":"1506844633","x-github-request-id":"A498:028A:1ACBADA:2EF2963:59D097DD","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=144>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=164>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=142>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"d15c58413308ae41f4aab67a97ae941f\"","status":"200 OK"}}
