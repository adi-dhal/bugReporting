doesn't support variable animation intervals, while the TMX format does. As a result, I set the interval in the frame loading loop, but only the last value gets used.  Good enough for me.  We can extend the AnimatedTiledMapTile in the future if we choose, and update the loader accordingly.\n\nThe TMX format is backwards-compatible with clients that don't support animations.  To do this, animated tiles replace the ids of static tiles (which may be used in the animation) so that Old clients will \"see\" a static tile. For example:\n\nTile 1 - Static tile\nTile 2 - Static tile\nTile 3 - Animated tile of Static Tiles 2, 3, and 4.\nTile 4 - Static tile\n\nStatic Tile 3 above is replaced with Animated Tile 3 if the client supports it.  Static Tile 3 exists, but only during loading really.  So we need to create all the Animated Tiles and store them in a separate array until they are all created so the Static Tile references can be resolved.

problem has driving me crazy i have two screens on my game the MainScreen with buttons and the GameScreen, i preload them both on game startup this is the code i have on MainScreen:\n\n```\n@Override\npublic void show() {\n    Gdx.input.setInputProcessor(stage);\n}\n\n@Override\npublic void hide() {\n    Gdx.input.setInputProcessor(null);\n}\n```\n\nAnd on the GameScren i have:\n\n```\n@Override\npublic void show() {\n    Gdx.input.setCatchBackKey(true);\n    InputMultiplexer multiplexer = new InputMultiplexer();\n    multiplexer.addProcessor(new GestureDetector(this));\n    multiplexer.addProcessor(stage);\n    Gdx.input.setInputProcessor(mInputMultiPlexer);\n}\n\n@Override\npublic void hide() {\n    Gdx.input.setCatchBackKey(false);\n    Gdx.input.setInputProcessor(null);\n}\n```\n\nThe problem is when i go back to Main Screen and hit Play button using setGameScreen() to go back to resume my Game a fling event is launched when i didn´t even touched the GameScreen. I tried using the ActorGestureListener and add it to my screen but it doesn´t work so well, using InputProcessor is perfect but that bug is really annoying what can i do to fix it?\n\nThank you for developing such awesome library\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2059/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2058","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2058/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2058/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2058/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2058","id":36888140,"number":2058,"title":"Reducing glBindTexture in SpriteBatch.flush() ?","user":{"login":"just4phil","id":2955658,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2955658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/just4phil","html_url":"https://github.com/just4phil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/just4phil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/just4phil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/just4phil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/just4phil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/just4phil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/just4phil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/just4phil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/just4phil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/just4phil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":16,"created_at":"2014-07-01T12:37:33Z","updated_at":"2014-07-05T16:14:02Z","closed_at":"2014-07-05T15:50:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"enhancement / performance:\n1.\ncouldnt we reduce Texture-binding in SpriteBatch.flush() by first checking if the texture has to change?\n\n2.\ncouldnt we reduce enable/disable-Blending in SpriteBatch.flush() by first checking if the blending state has to change?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2058/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2057","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2057/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2057/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2057/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2057","id":36855780,"number":2057,"title":"Controller Vibration","user":{"login":"ChetRippo","id":1483832,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1483832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChetRippo","html_url":"https://github.com/ChetRippo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChetRippo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChetRippo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChetRippo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChetRippo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChetRippo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChetRippo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChetRippo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChetRippo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChetRippo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-07-01T01:50:49Z","updated_at":"2014-07-05T15:51:11Z","closed_at":"2014-07-05T15:51:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'd like to add gamepad vibration to my game.
