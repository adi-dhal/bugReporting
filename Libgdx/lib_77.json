First of all majority of loading time is spent in Sync method of ModelLoader with main culprit being loadAnimations of Model class (spends lots of time making NodeKeyframes from ModelNodeKeyframes). Secondly when this model is instantiated with ModelInstance all the animation keyframes as well as MeshParts are needlessly copied all over again.\nFor my app I was able to eliminate lag completely by making very intrusive changes for old version of libgdx a year ago and by removing needles copying mentioned above, and by removing ModelNodeKeyframe class completely and changing NodeKeyframe class slightly to accommodate for a change.\n\nYou should look whether such changes can be implemented without breaking libgdx design and whether preserving current design is worth current loading time.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2610/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2609","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2609/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2609/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2609/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2609","id":50317659,"number":2609,"title":"[GWT] Error accessing field on deserialization","user":{"login":"maximojr","id":9698533,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9698533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximojr","html_url":"https://github.com/maximojr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximojr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximojr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximojr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximojr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximojr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximojr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximojr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximojr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maximojr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2014-11-27T18:58:13Z","updated_at":"2014-12-17T01:19:21Z","closed_at":"2014-12-17T01:19:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When the GWT (app running on Google Chrome) tries to build a object from a json throws the exception:\nUncaught com.badlogic.gdx.utils.SerializationException: Error accessing field: [field name]\n\nIf the class to be parsed only have String fields works fine, even though they are private fields.

several days and wasn't able to make it work.  \n\nI'm trying to make two buttons work together so that they both could be touched at the same time, the problem is when the first button is touched
