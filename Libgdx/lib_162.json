needed a list which can hold arbitrary items. This list is kinda inspired by the list in Android (and its list adapter). It creates a table for each row item, so it would be more memory demanding than the standard List widget.\n\nOne requirement is that this list adapter must be passed in the constructor, if not the list won't know what to do with its items. Some standard behavior could be added later though.\n\nA scrolling effect could be added by wrapping the list in a ScrollPane, though this has not been tested. A change listener can be added to the list in order to detect what items are selected.\nBasic usage:\n\n``` java\nListAdapter<String> adapter = new ListAdapter<String>() {\n    @Override\n    public Table setupRow(String item) {\n        Table t = new Table();\n        // Generate a simple Label and add that to the table\n        t.add(Assets.getInstance().getLabel(item, \"default\")).fill().expand();\n        return t;\n    }\n};\n\nTableList<String> list = new TableList<String>(adapter, new String[]{\"item1\", \"item2\"}, skin);\nstage.add(list);\n```\n\nI hope this is something that could be usable for others as well. :-) \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/64/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/63","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/63/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/63/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/63/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/63","id":7534149,"number":63,"title":"BitmapFont(), lineHeight should be scaled across the y-axis.","user":{"login":"vanlim","id":2288421,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2288421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanlim","html_url":"https://github.com/vanlim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanlim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanlim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanlim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanlim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanlim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanlim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanlim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanlim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanlim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2012-10-12T04:59:23Z","updated_at":"2013-10-08T04:55:59Z","closed_at":"2012-10-12T05:00:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/63","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/63","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/63.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/63.patch"},"body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/63/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/62","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/62/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/62/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/62/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/62","id":7525152,"number":62,"title":"Fix for issue 1045","user":{"login":"acoppes","id":591852,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/591852?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acoppes","html_url":"https://github.com/acoppes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acoppes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acoppes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acoppes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acoppes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acoppes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acoppes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acoppes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acoppes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acoppes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2012-10-11T20:10:57Z","updated_at":"2013-09-14T19:07:58Z","closed_at":"2012-10-30T11:10:44Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/62","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/62","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/62.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/62.patch"},"body":"Modified AtlasRegion.flip(x,y) to use packedWidth, packedHeight depending on the rotate value to fix the issue 1045, tested with the same test attached at the issue page: http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/issues/detail?id=1045 and also with https://github.com/gemserk/libgdx-tests.

I implemented the socket connection functionality over java.net.*. \n\nRequest for feedback:\n\n1) not sure about naming all those hint variables. I wonder what Mono uses? My naming matches what Java offers though but they seem quite inconsistent with the TCP specs. Sometimes following the TCP specs naming convention, other times not? Sometimes it's called \"soTimeout\", sometimes just \"timeout\". Anyhow, I followed the Java naming, the only thing I didn't follow was the soTimeout (server hints). I think calling it \"acceptTimeout\" is a lot clearer? \n\n2) I implemented the classes for the LWJGL backend. This will be the exact same for Android. How would I go about that without producing duplicate code? \n\n3) we should add a newServerSocket/newClientSocket without the hints? No hints meaning to use the platform defaults. I already check if hints if null and if it is null it will simply use the defaults on the platform.\n\n4) not sure what \"backlog\" means (server hints)?\n\nPlease note I haven't tested it at all (sorry, didn't have time yet). It should compile just fine. Not sure if you should merge it just yet? I am mainly posting it to gather some feedback.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/49/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/48","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/48/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/48/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/48/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/48","id":7247645,"number":48,"title":"Added support for right/bottom edge fill lines in .9.png files.","user":{"login":"psiegel","id":2452274,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2452274?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiegel","html_url":"https://github.com/psiegel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiegel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiegel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiegel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiegel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiegel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiegel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiegel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiegel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiegel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2012-09-30T18:27:29Z","updated_at":"2014-06-20T12:01:08Z","closed_at":"2012-10-04T05:47:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/48","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/48","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/48.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/48.patch"},"body":"- Modified TexturePacker2 to include padding values in atlases.\n- Modified TextureAtlas and Skin to load said values and pass them on to NinePatches built from them.\n- Modified NinePatch to store padding values, as well asprovide getters/setters.\n- Modified NinePatchDrawable to use these values.\n- Modified default-round.9.png to include bottom/right fill values as test.
