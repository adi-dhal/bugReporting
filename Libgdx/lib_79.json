Take, for example, `Matrix4` `.tra()` & `.trn()` (I never know which one to use without checking the param signatures in the docs) - and it's not an isolated case. While I'm in favor of short, 3-4 letter names of operations and the chaining rule here, providing a more descriptive (or even JLS-compliant) naming variant would be helpful here IMO. I'm not saying \"change the names\", because current names are OK in many cases and changing them would obviously break current implementations - I'm rather in favour of, for example\n\n``` java\n/** @see #trn() */\nMatrix4 transpose() {\n    return trn();\n}\n```\n\n-ish set of methods, complementing what's already there. Also, providing JLS-standard naming of getXXX/setXXX would also reduce the brain overhead for programmers with Java background.\n\nNote we already have many methods named that way, `setToXXX`, `setAsXXX``` etc - making the naming more consistent with standard one would be a great improvement and would reduce learning curve for libGDX a lot IMO. It would also make possible for a user (or even libGDX team) to create immutable (or other) variants of those classes for further use - for a programmer using a direct field access is bound to a single implementation of object's data access. Allowing the programmer to choose the scheme himself (either direct field for brevity and speed or set/get to allow abstraction and implementation substitution) would be certainly a Good Thing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2562/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2561","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2561/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2561/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2561/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2561","id":48156079,"number":2561,"title":"ScrollPane.scrollToCenter should center horizontally too","user":{"login":"aegamesi","id":552502,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/552502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aegamesi","html_url":"https://github.com/aegamesi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aegamesi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aegamesi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aegamesi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aegamesi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aegamesi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aegamesi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aegamesi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aegamesi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aegamesi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-11-08T05:10:52Z","updated_at":"2014-11-09T14:20:54Z","closed_at":"2014-11-09T14:20:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Since ScrollPane can scroll in both the x and y directions, it would make sense that [ScrollPane.scrollToCenter](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/scenes/scene2d/ui/ScrollPane.java#L788) (which \"Sets the scroll offset so the specified rectangle is fully in view and centered vertically in the scroll pane, if possible.\") would center the rectangle in both the horizontal and vertical directions, not just the vertical one.

calculation for `secondsPerBuffer` was off for MP3 as the decoder apparently requires a 4096 bytes buffer overhead. This caused the reported time from `getPosition()` to become more and more off as the playback went on, and the issue also plagued `setPosition()` who relied on the same numbers for it's positioning. I've taken this overhead into account and the reported position is now spot on.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2551/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2550","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2550/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2550/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2550/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2550","id":47883047,"number":2550,"title":"Music not playing in Lollipop","user":{"login":"Badazdz","id":1550507,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1550507?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Badazdz","html_url":"https://github.com/Badazdz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Badazdz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Badazdz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Badazdz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Badazdz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Badazdz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Badazdz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Badazdz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Badazdz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Badazdz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":59604218,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/android","name":"android","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":11336980,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":13,"created_at":"2014-11-05T20:20:49Z","updated_at":"2014-11-19T00:28:42Z","closed_at":"2014-11-19T00:28:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"First in Lollipop preview app freezed on MediaPlayer.prepare() call in final build of Lollipop no music is played at all...\nSound class is working fine, only Music is silent.\nThis shows up in Logcat\n![gfs](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1550507/4925173/0f096e14-6529-11e4-8a83-b7f9c5a7fd1f.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2550/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2549","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2549/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2549/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2549/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2549","id":47802819,"number":2549,"title":"Music .mp3 files silent on iPhone 4 7.1","user":{"login":"brthornbury","id":3271382,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3271382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brthornbury","html_url":"https://github.com/brthornbury","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brthornbury/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brthornbury/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brthornbury/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brthornbury/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brthornbury/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brthornbury/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brthornbury/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brthornbury/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brthornbury/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-11-05T06:05:12Z","updated_at":"2014-11-06T02:17:41Z","closed_at":"2014-11-06T02:17:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello,\n\nI've read through all previous posts about the sound problems on robovm and have not found any solutions to this problem. \n\nIn Desktop, Android, and iOS Simulator, all sounds play perfectly.
