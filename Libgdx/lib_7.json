I've also added proper POV support for gamepads reporting a \"standard\" mapping. In my tests, only XInput gamepads reported as \"standard\" and everyting else had different ways of reporting their pov, which also differed between browsers.\r\n\r\nThis was tested as working on Chrome, Firefox and Opera.

Issue details\r\nThe BaseShader is creating garbage int[] arrays each frame in BaseShader.getAttributeLocations  when using meshes with a different number of vertex attributes. https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/graphics/g3d/shaders/BaseShader.java#L215 \r\n\r\nHaving a different number of vertex attributes oftens means a different shader would be used for the renderanble, so IntArray add/shrink would never create new internal int[] arrays and everything would be fine. However, when rendering shadows, the same shader (DepthShader) is handling all the non-skinned meshes (good) causing the tempArray to constantly recreate its underlying int[] array (bad).\r\n\r\nAfter discussing with Xoppa, the best solution is to add a 'size' argument to the bind/unbind methods in  Mesh, VertexData, and all implementing classes in the backends.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction

reason for this is so the TextureRegionDrawable itself, or any WidgetGroup that references it, can be used in a Pool. If you have a widget that is poolable and references any TextureRegion (indirectly through a TextureRegionDrawable), there needs to be a way to null out the TextureRegion reference for returning it to the pool. \r\n\r\nThis moves the NPE from `setRegion` to `draw`, but presumably `draw` won't be called on it if it's been sent to a pool.\r\n\r\nMy use case is that I have a large panel of custom image buttons, and the number of buttons and the images vary each time the panel is brought up, so I wanted to pool the buttons to make it a bit more snappy.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4702/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4701","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4701/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4701/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4701/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4701","id":222015551,"number":4701,"title":"Added setX and setY methods with alignment argument","user":{"login":"nevabyte","id":24990632,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/24990632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nevabyte","html_url":"https://github.com/nevabyte","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nevabyte/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nevabyte/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nevabyte/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nevabyte/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nevabyte/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nevabyte/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nevabyte/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nevabyte/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nevabyte/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-04-16T15:16:22Z","updated_at":"2017-09-01T21:48:20Z","closed_at":"2017-09-01T21:48:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/4701","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4701","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4701.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4701.patch"},"body":"Found myself looking for these methods so decided to create them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4700","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4700/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4700/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4700/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4700","id":222012846,"number":4700,"title":"NetJavaImpl.HttpClientResponse swallowing exceptions thrown by HttpURLConnection","user":{"login":"czyzby","id":11707612,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11707612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/czyzby","html_url":"https://github.com/czyzby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czyzby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czyzby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czyzby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czyzby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czyzby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czyzby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czyzby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czyzby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czyzby/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336980,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true},{"id":11336982,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2017-04-16T14:22:37Z","updated_at":"2017-04-21T13:46:12Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"#### Issue details\r\n`HttpClientResponse` silently ignores all exceptions thrown by the `Connection` input stream, including exception thrown if the connection was already closed. After the response content is extracted with `getResult` (or one of its alternatives), the input stream is closed and subsequent calls to `getResult` will return an empty byte array, empty stream or empty string, without warning the user.\r\n\r\nPossible solutions:\r\n- Cache response result as byte array. Wrap with string or input stream on demand. Make `HttpClientResponse` thread-safe and reusable.\r\n- Rethrow silently ignored exceptions. I think making `HttpResponse` a single-use object is somewhat OK, as long as the user is able to track the source of the issue.\r\n- At the very least - add some warning logs for ignored exceptions.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction\r\nA Kotlin example reproducing the issue - should be trivial to convert to Java:\r\n```Kotlin\r\nfun main(args: Array<String>) {\r\n  val net = NetJavaImpl()\r\n  val request = HttpRequest(\"GET\")\r\n  request.url = \"http://google.com\"\r\n  net.sendHttpRequest(request, object : HttpResponseListener {\r\n    override fun cancelled() = Unit\r\n    override fun failed(t: Throwable?) {\r\n      t?.printStackTrace()\r\n    }\r\n    override fun handleHttpResponse(httpResponse: HttpResponse) {\r\n      println(\"Content: ${httpResponse.resultAsString}\")\r\n      println(\"Content: ${httpResponse.resultAsString}\")\r\n    }\r\n  })\r\n  Thread.sleep(1000L)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`\"Content: \"` is printed by the second `println` execution.
