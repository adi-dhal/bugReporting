encountered this in my game prototype, so I created a new LibGDX project to test it. It happens sporadically, but I couldn't reproduce it until adding a frame buffer to the game. That could be a coincidence though, because I cannot reliably reproduce the issue.\n\nIt's maddening that this happens sporadically, but the best way I've found to reproduce it is to open the game, turn off the phone, and reopen the game about three hours later. When I do this, the blank clear color screen shows up about 30% of the time. I have been doing this with my personal phone, so its possible that my occasional use of the Chrome browser is contributing to whatever RAM or GPU condition triggers it.\n\nHowever, I once encountered the issue by opening the game, hitting the power button, hitting the power button again to turn on the screen, and unlocking the lock screen. The game returned to the clear color screen. However, since then I have tried turning the screen on and off many times and couldn't get this to happen again.\n\nThere are no black rectangles where the textures were, so I don't think the problem is them getting disposed. I am also setting the projection matrix to identity on each frame, so I don't think the resize method is confounding this.\n\nI set it to show a different color for the clear color depending on phone orientation. Rotating the screen changes the clear color back and forth, but the textures do not reappear.\n\nI realize you might not be able to make progress on this without being able to reproduce it. If so, I would appreciate some tips on how I might get started tracking it down. Maybe someone has some idea what could cause meshes not to draw at all, while the clear color still shows. Could some of the gl settings be getting changed somehow, like face culling turned on?
