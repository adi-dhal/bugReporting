Having the posibility to override the DPI so that getDensity() (which is used throughout the game) returns \"fake\" values would make debugging layouts and scaling a lot faster.\n\nE.g. having an additional field in LwjglApplicationConfiguration backend:\n\n```\n    LwjglApplicationConfiguration cfg = new LwjglApplicationConfiguration();\n    cfg.fullscreen = false;\n    cfg.resizable = false;\n    cfg.width = 480;\n    cfg.height = 320;\n    cfg.densityOverride = 165;\n```\n\nThis would essentially emulate a 3.5\", 480x320 phone display. It would be much faster and easier than firing up an emulator or acquiring a similar device. Alternatively maybe one could have a field for display size inches? Like `cfg.emulateDisplaySize = 3.5f` would calculate the correct DPI.\n\nNot sure how feasible this would be to implement, but it would sure make creating a multi-display layout easier!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1822","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1822/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1822/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1822/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1822","id":33154037,"number":1822,"title":"Save

stage and many other classes (like OrthogonalTiledMapRenderer) doesn't check if their batch is already drawing. This makes it useless (if not custom shader) to feed your own batch into for example a stage. This is an example were stage could have checked if their batch was already drawing : http://pastebin.com/5LL82MxQ, and if the change was made, would look like this: http://pastebin.com/Kus1CVGm. This would lower the draw calls and not destroy already existing libgdx programs. \n\nTrue, the performance isn't really affected much because of this, but maybe just tiny tiny bit. The performance would only be better if (talking about the example) the sprite and stages textures came from the same textureatlas. \n\nThe performance would get a tiny bit lowered because of the constant checking.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1820/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1819","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1819/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1819/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1819/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1819","id":33113378,"number":1819,"title":"Dont know how to add the inheritance dependencies in order to use tween","user":{"login":"tantch","id":6810521,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6810521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tantch","html_url":"https://github.com/tantch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tantch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tantch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tantch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tantch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tantch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tantch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tantch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tantch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tantch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-05-08T19:06:02Z","updated_at":"2014-05-08T19:24:36Z","closed_at":"2014-05-08T19:24:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"is it possible to explain where the files gwt are in the example cause i have no idea\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1818","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1818/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1818/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1818/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1818","id":33091657,"number":1818,"title":"Added option to SharedLibraryFinder interface to specify extraction sub-...","user":{"login":"code-disaster","id":4644167,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4644167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/code-disaster","html_url":"https://github.com/code-disaster","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/code-disaster/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/code-disaster/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/code-disaster/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/code-disaster/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/code-disaster/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/code-disaster/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/code-disaster/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/code-disaster/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/code-disaster/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336982,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-05-08T15:05:49Z","updated_at":"2014-08-15T11:57:33Z","closed_at":"2014-05-08T17:04:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/1818","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1818","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1818.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1818.patch"},"body":"...folder for native libraries.\n\nBy default JniGenSharedLibraryLoader extracts each native library to its own temp folder (named by the crc32 of its content).
