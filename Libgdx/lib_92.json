a JRE or JDK 8, the libgdx map implementations actually have a compile error. As an example:\n\n> Duplicate methods named remove with the parameters () and () are inherited from the types `ObjectMap.MapIterator<K,V>` and `Iterator<ObjectMap.Entry<K,V>>`\n\nThis is the declaration of the class with the error:\n\n```\nstatic public class Entries<K, V> extends MapIterator<K, V> implements Iterable<Entry<K, V>>, Iterator<Entry<K, V>> {\n```\n\nThat's because with Java 8 `Iterator` now also provides a default implementation for `remove()`. Since `MapIterator` also does that, there's a conflict. I resolved it by explicitly overriding the method in all classes which have this conflict and solve it by saying which one should be used, without using the Java 8 syntax to do so. That way it should still be compliant with Java 6 compilers, while at the same time supporting Java 8 compilers.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2157/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2156","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2156/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2156/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2156/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2156","id":38556638,"number":2156,"title":"Meshbuilder","user":{"login":"jgooderham","id":728467,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/728467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgooderham","html_url":"https://github.com/jgooderham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgooderham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgooderham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgooderham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgooderham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgooderham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgooderham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgooderham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgooderham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgooderham/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"xoppa","id":2349087,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2349087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa","html_url":"https://github.com/xoppa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"xoppa","id":2349087,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2349087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa","html_url":"https://github.com/xoppa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2014-07-23T18:20:13Z","updated_at":"2015-02-02T16:24:59Z","closed_at":"2015-02-02T16:24:59Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/2156","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2156","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2156.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2156.patch"},"body":"added
