am following libgdx wiki, in particular the part about changing the viewport in Scene2d:\n\nhttps://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Scene2d#wiki-viewport\n\nI used the code provided, with some stage size of mine and using **fillY() instead of fit()**:\n\n``` java\npublic void resize (int width, int height) {\n    Vector2 size = Scaling.fillY.apply(STAGE_WIDTH, STAGE_HEIGHT, width, height);\n    this.viewportX = (int)(width - size.x) / 2;\n    this.viewportY = (int)(height - size.y) / 2;\n    this.viewportWidth = (int)size.x;\n    this.viewportHeight = (int)size.y;\n

this.viewportWidth, this.viewportHeight); is not called.\n\nI found out that **in my render(float delta) I have to call glViewport again, each time**:\n\n``` java\npublic void render(float delta) {\n\nGdx.gl.glViewport(this.viewportX, this.viewportY, this.viewportWidth, this.viewportHeight); // Must call this again, to keep the new viewport.\n\nGdx.gl.glClearColor(1, 1, 1,

is called again somewhere in the Robovm backend?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1414","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1414/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1414/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1414/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1414","id":28559067,"number":1414,"title":"[gdx-jnigen]

using gdx-jnigen in some projects I work on, and I have some library dependencies which I would like to pack in the same jar file, something I did before already. However, this time, the libraries I have to use are not postfixed with 64 for the 64-bit version.\nThis gives 2 problems:\n1. Name clashes occur for the dependencies for each platform.\n2. The jnigen libloader refuses to load the 64 bit versions, since they don't have the postfix.\n\nI can't change the names of the dependencies, since the resolvement of dependencies on windows fails when I do.\n\nThe first problem is solvable by adding subdirectories which represent the different platforms and architectures. However, the second problems is not solvable at the moment. When solving the first problem, the second one becomes more complicated.\n\nMy suggestion is to add a \"libfinder\", which would be an interface that can be implemented by the user, and supply that to the libloader, which would then use this libfinder to find the libraries for the given platform. The default searchpaths would stay the same as they are now, while providing a way for the developers to use more advanced structures.\n\nI would be willing to implement this, but I would first like to know if there is some other way to get this done. Also I would like to know your opinions on this...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1413","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1413/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1413/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1413/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1413","id":28558460,"number":1413,"title":"Resolve

It only seems to happen when the texture is in the application memory while the application is paused some how.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1408","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1408/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1408/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1408/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1408","id":28505050,"number":1408,"title":"Load OBJ file, Multiple material not supported","user":{"login":"Eloy007","id":6812913,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6812913?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eloy007","html_url":"https://github.com/Eloy007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eloy007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eloy007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eloy007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eloy007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eloy007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eloy007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eloy007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eloy007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eloy007/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-02-28T14:39:48Z","updated_at":"2014-02-28T21:47:27Z","closed_at":"2014-02-28T21:47:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Model loading from OBJ,FBX,G3DB file not supported multiple material.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1408/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1407","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1407/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1407/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1407/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1407","id":28496452,"number":1407,"title":"Continuation of Bug #897(IOS resizing issue when using glviewport) ","user":{"login":"jitheeshsk","id":6497623,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6497623?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jitheeshsk","html_url":"https://github.com/jitheeshsk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jitheeshsk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jitheeshsk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jitheeshsk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jitheeshsk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jitheeshsk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jitheeshsk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jitheeshsk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jitheeshsk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jitheeshsk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-02-28T12:15:41Z","updated_at":"2014-03-18T21:52:20Z","closed_at":"2014-03-18T21:52:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello i'm resizing and maintaining the game aspect by cropping the excess part using the following code.\n\nprivate void resizeWorld(int width, int height) {\n        float aspect = width/(float)height;  \n        sceneController.resize(width, height);\n\n```\n    Vector2 size = null;\n    if(aspect<Consts.SD_DESIGN_ASPECT_RATIO){\n        size = Scaling.fillY.apply(Consts.DESIGN_WIDTH_METERS, Consts.DESIGN_HEIGHT_METERS, width, height);\n    }\n    else{\n        size = Scaling.fillX.apply(Consts.DESIGN_WIDTH_METERS, Consts.DESIGN_HEIGHT_METERS, width, height);\n    }\n    int viewportX = (int)(width - size.x) / 2;\n    int viewportY = (int)(height - size.y) / 2;\n    int viewportWidth = (int)size.x;\n    int viewportHeight = (int)size.y;\n    Gdx.gl.glViewport(viewportX, viewportY, viewportWidth, viewportHeight);\n\n    camera.update();\n```\n\n}\nIn this I first calculate the length and width to zoom in and fill the screen and then calculate the offset to center in the view.Whole of this is done by setting glViewPort manually.\n\nIt works fine in android and windows version.

This pull request is only a small sample of the suggestions made for libgdx.\n\nNo functional changes were made in any of the commits.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1400/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1399","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1399/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1399/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1399/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1399","id":28310530,"number":1399,"title":"[RoboVM] Out of memory when loading large images","user":{"login":"apotapov","id":131698,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/131698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apotapov","html_url":"https://github.com/apotapov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apotapov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apotapov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apotapov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apotapov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apotapov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apotapov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apotapov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apotapov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apotapov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-02-26T05:54:48Z","updated_at":"2014-02-28T10:04:53Z","closed_at":"2014-02-28T10:04:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We have been working on a game targeting iOS and Android both phones and tablets.\n\nTo support higher resolution screens we are packaging some of our images at 1080x1920. Currently we have 9 such images. We are also trying to use mipmaps to support various screen resolutions. To do that we are packaging the images into 2048x2048 atlases. (We tried 4096x4096 atlases as well)\n\nEverything works perfectly on Desktop, Android and iPad and iPod simulator. However, when deploying to the latest iPod Touch the app crashes with a signal 9 exit code. Reading up on that error code turned out to be an out of memory issue. After enabling debug logging on AssetManager, the culprit seems to be the loading of 2048x2048 textures. The app does okay with 2-3 of them, but more than that blows the memory past 1GB mark at which point the app throws a signal 9.\n\nThe work around that we are currently using for an alpha release of the game is to scale the images down to half the size, 540x960, which only requires two 2048x2048 atlas images. This allows to load the game on the device and runs at a consistent 230mb of RAM or so. The Desktop version of the game in comparison runs at about 30mb of RAM according to JProfiler.\n\nWe have tried playing around with various other atlas packaging settings like turning off mipmaps, reducing the JPG quality, getting rid of transparency, but nothing seems to help. \n\nJust an FYI, the images total about 2.1mb on disk as compressed jpg and about 40mb as uncompressed png.\n\nSeems like the issue is a memory leak. Perhaps a more aggressive garbage collection schema would do the trick here, not sure how to trigger that manually.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1399/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1398","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1398/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1398/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1398/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1398","id":28244706,"number":1398,"title":"Added missing buildscript snapshot repository required for GDX-Tools resolution","user":{"login":"sixman9","id":464118,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/464118?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixman9","html_url":"https://github.com/sixman9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixman9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixman9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixman9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixman9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixman9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixman9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixman9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixman9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sixman9/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-02-25T12:51:51Z","updated_at":"2014-06-12T12:48:53Z","closed_at":"2014-02-25T15:26:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/1398","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1398","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1398.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1398.patch"},"body":"Build script was failing due to not finding '**com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-tools:1.0-SNAPSHOT**'.
