Although that covers all requirements it would be very convenient to allow to sort the actors of a group via a Comparator.\n\nPossible via a method like Group.sort(Comparator) which is backed by Collections.sort(children, comparator).

Create a Sequence inside a Forever-Action. In my example I wanted an Image to ScaleUp and down all the time. It made: ScaleUp,Down,Up and from that point stopped scaling.\n\ne.g.:\nanyactor.action(Forever.$(Sequence.$(ScaleTo.$(1.1f, 1.1f,0.3f),ScaleTo.$(1f, 1f, 0.3f))));\n\nThe problem was the copy-mechanism of Sequence. Sequence called the finish()-method of every included action that is done. That is okay aslong you don't want to restart/copy the sequence.\n\nWhen ScaleTo obtains an unused ScaleTo-Action it retrieves the last finished action(which is still referenced in the sequence) (in my case the ScaleTo(1,1,0.3)) and sets the new values for the first ScaleTo of the Sequence (in this case ScaleTo(1.1,1.1,0.3))\nWhen the scale adds the second ScaleTo the values are already corrupted and the whole Sequence is trapped at the 1.1,1.1-Values.\n\nI know wrote it confuse but it was a very mind blowing debugging :D\n\nTo make the long story short, the Sequence's child-actions are now finished at the time the Sequence is finished. That solved at least my problem. BTW: What is about that $ as a method-name! Is that something special? Never saw that before :D What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

So I've an idea to extend libgdx to support live wallpaper. I have to do the following things to achieve that:\n1). Borrow the code from Robert Green ( http://www.rbgrn.net/content/354-glsurfaceview-adapted-3d-live-wallpapers ). Though his code has big overlap with android GLSurfaceView, he really did a lot of test and hack on different devices. His code will be the base class.\n2). I have to change some method parameters in AndroidGraphics, AndroidInput,AndroidAudio etc which only accept AndroidApplication object.\n3). Create the AndroidLivewallpaper as a parallel to AndroidfApplication, which extends the GLSurfaceView. It will do the actual work to support live wallpaper and libgdx core engine.\n\nHow about the idea? Should it the best way to do it?\n\n_Original issue: http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/issues/detail?id=95_\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/682","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/682/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/682/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/682/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/682","id":19509495,"number":682,"title":"[Box2D] Implement pre and post-solve events in ContactListener","user":{"login":"badlogic","id":514052,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/514052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic","html_url":"https://github.com/badlogic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336982,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":13,"created_at":"2013-09-14T20:05:38Z","updated_at":"2013-09-14T20:05:47Z","closed_at":"2013-09-14T20:05:47Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"_From [alexvem](https://code.google.com/u/alexvem/) on January 11, 2011 01:25:54_\n\nIt would be awesome if you could implement a complete ContactListener for the java/jni wrapper.\n\n_Original issue: http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/issues/detail?id=94_\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/682/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/681","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/681/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/681/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/681/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/681","id":19509492,"number":681,"title":"MD5Mesh/Animation serializable + MD5 pingpong wraptype + clear-stage","user":{"login":"badlogic","id":514052,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/514052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic","html_url":"https://github.com/badlogic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336985,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/wontfix","name":"wontfix","color":"ffffff","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2013-09-14T20:05:32Z","updated_at":"2017-09-13T09:33:14Z","closed_at":"2013-09-14T20:05:37Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"_From [thomas.t...@googlemail.com](https://code.google.com/u/110759639387810803479/) on January 11, 2011 00:03:43_\n\nHola here a patch for the 3 different issues.\n\n1) Serialization. \nJust added 'implements Serializable' and a default serialVersionUID\n2) Ping Pong + AnimationDirection\nI modified the Animator-Class. Now there are 3 different WRAPMODES:\nWRAPTYPE_LOOP,WRAPTYPE_CLAMP,WRAPTYPE_PINGPONG \nLOOP and CLAMP were implemented before I added PINGPONG which changes the direction back to the start where it changes again (framecount like this: 1234321234...)\n\nAnd as I needed it for the pingpong you now can change the animation-direction as well! Don't have a real usecase for this know, but some creative people might need it ;D. You can change the direction with setAnimationDirection(ANIMDIR_FORWARD/ANIMDIR_BACKWARD). I hope there are no sideeffect with die KeyframedModel. I didn't know exactly what it is for but it should be fine.\n\n3) I need a way to clear the whole stage! there for I added in Group a method removeActors() which clears groups and actors list. This method is called by the clearStage() method in stage!\n\nHope, the changes are ok for you and sry for creating one issue for actually three...ToM\n\n_Original issue: http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/issues/detail?id=93_\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/680","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/680/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/680/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/680/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/680","id":19509491,"number":680,"title":"Black screen in loading gdxtest as well as gdx-helloworld","user":{"login":"badlogic","id":514052,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/514052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic","html_url":"https://github.com/badlogic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336980,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2013-09-14T20:05:28Z","updated_at":"2013-09-14T20:05:31Z","closed_at":"2013-09-14T20:05:31Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"_From [mewf...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/114694344940924760515/) on January 09, 2011 03:53:31_\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem? 1. connect phone to pc with usb debugging\n2. change to sleep mode by pressing power button\n3. start the project(s) in eclipse to run in the device\n4. press power button to return from sleep mode What is the expected output?
