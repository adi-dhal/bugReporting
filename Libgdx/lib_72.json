Other methods, especially `listener.handleHttpResponse()`, `listener.failed()` and `listener.cancelled()` are now lock free. Otherwise longer operations within these listener methods (like downloading a huge file) would block access to the connections and listeners maps and therefore new http requests would wait until these methods have finished execution (like the file has been downloaded).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2770","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2770/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2770/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2770/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2770","id":55254958,"number":2770,"title":"Add out/, classes/, gen-external-apklibs/ to .gitignore","user":{"login":"venshine","id":1456580,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1456580?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/venshine","html_url":"https://github.com/venshine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venshine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venshine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venshine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venshine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venshine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venshine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venshine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venshine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venshine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-01-23T08:03:55Z","updated_at":"2015-02-02T15:40:10Z","closed_at":"2015-02-02T15:40:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/2770","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2770","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2770.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2770.patch"},"body":"“out/”, “classes/” and \"gen-external-apklibs/\" are generated in Intellij IDEA ,maven and android-maven-plugin environment.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2770/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2769","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2769/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2769/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2769/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2769","id":55254358,"number":2769,"title":"Bullet btFixedConstraint missing","user":{"login":"sommd","id":7817485,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7817485?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sommd","html_url":"https://github.com/sommd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sommd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sommd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sommd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sommd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sommd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sommd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sommd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sommd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sommd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336982,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-01-23T07:53:38Z","updated_at":"2015-02-02T17:56:58Z","closed_at":"2015-02-02T17:56:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I've tried the latest stable and the latest nightly and it seems that the btFixedConstraint is missing from the wrapper.

This happens with a app on iOS when UIStatusBarHidden is set to false. When the status bar is hidden, touch coordinates are correct. The offset is about the size of the status bar, so I think this isn't being taken into account somehow? Test case [here](http://pastebin.com/CG5SDVKi). \n\nIt's barely noticeable most of the time, but, for instance, if you hit the bottom of buttons in a stage they don't respond.

context:\nI want to get information from begin/endcontacts.\n\nProblem statement:\nI have one static body with multiple fixtures and one dynamic body. When they collide beginContact is called. After (outside the step) I destroy one fixture from static body. Then I expect endContact to be called for destroyed fixture but it does not(instead beginContact is called again for other static fixtures(they already were called in the past)). Why? Is it a bug in libgdx?\nUPD: It is a libgdx bug. In Box2d source code endContact is called, but libgdx jni wrapper does not call.\nUPD: destroyBody and setTransformation work fine but destroyFixture not. So I looked into libgdx jni wrapper:\nUPD: Same problem with setActive(false)!\ndestroyBody:\n\n``` cpp\nJNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_com_badlogic_gdx_physics_box2d_World_jniDestroyBody(JNIEnv* env, jobject object, jlong addr, jlong bodyAddr) {\n\n\n//@line:333\n\n        b2World* world = (b2World*)addr;\n        b2Body* body = (b2Body*)bodyAddr;\n        CustomContactFilter contactFilter(env, object);\n        CustomContactListener contactListener(env,object);\n        world->SetContactFilter(&contactFilter);\n        world->SetContactListener(&contactListener);\n        world->DestroyBody(body);\n        world->SetContactFilter(&defaultFilter);\n        world->SetContactListener(0);\n\n\n}\n```\n\ndestroyFixture:\n\n``` cpp\nJNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_com_badlogic_gdx_physics_box2d_Body_jniDestroyFixture(JNIEnv* env, jobject object, jlong addr, jlong fixtureAddr) {\n\n\n//@line:133\n\n        b2Body* body = (b2Body*)addr;\n        b2Fixture* fixture = (b2Fixture*)fixtureAddr;\n        body->DestroyFixture(fixture);\n\n\n}\n```\n\nSo it's looks like this code is missed inside destroyFixture:\nUPD: same code is also missed in setActive !\n\n``` cpp\n        world->SetContactFilter(&contactFilter);\n        world->SetContactListener(&contactListener);\n```\n\nAm I correct?\n\nCode to see the bug:\n\n``` java\npackage
