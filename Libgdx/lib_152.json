The sphere/cone/cylinder methods still need to be optimized though.\n\nTests:\n- Add a base test with a grid/axes and only delegates the actual rendering for easy testing.\n- Use MeshBuilder instead of ShapeRenderer so the mesh is cached.\n- Add a base test which displays fps and allows to select a model for easy testing.\n- Update NewModelTest to use that.\n\nThis should help for easier testing lighting/shaders.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/349","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/349/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/349/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/349/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/349","id":13198472,"number":349,"title":"Added convenient setColor methods for decal.","user":{"login":"aspic","id":788059,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/788059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspic","html_url":"https://github.com/aspic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2013-04-15T13:04:10Z","updated_at":"2013-04-19T15:55:45Z","closed_at":"2013-04-19T15:55:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/349","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/349","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/349.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/349.patch"},"body":"Added setColor for decal (the same as Sprite and Spritebatch) uses.

least one recent commit https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/commit/7020231ca8b1e14995d398603de525581e3d1282 has completely disabled VBO support in the SpriteBatch class for not so clear reasons. \nMy project uses GL20 for now only and I would like to use/test VBOs, so at least there's a way to bring back VBOs in spritebatch by using the forceVBO flag.\n\nIf someone could clarify why SpriteBatch was changed I would appreciate as well. \nReason being is that setting a new texture for every draw can be the cause of the slow down instead of the vbo itself. \nEg: Some engines can sort the meshes by material before drawing, minimizing state changes for performance reasons.\n\nAlso one thing not taken into account in the SpriteBatch class is culling with GL_CULL_FACE which could theoretically help with performance. Spritebatch uses a (non default) CW front face order (default is CCW as front face), which makes things a little bit uneasy if you have mixed usage with other custom CCW meshes, but that's a non issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4846","x-ratelimit-reset":"1506844633","x-github-request-id":"BD6A:028B:DEB8FF:2EF56C4:59D0986F","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=153>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=164>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=151>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"bd62f6c2e1ed90fffcacf1aaaaf5df76\"","status":"200 OK"}}
