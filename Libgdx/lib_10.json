But it has no override for `Group#removeActor(Actor, boolean)` which causes next bug: if child actor calls `remove()` on self, it triggers parent's `Group#removeActor(Actor, boolean)` and not `Group#removeActor(Actor)`, so `Container` will simply call super method (of `Group`) and keep reference to child actor.\r\n\r\nLooks like regression bug, because javadoc of `Actor#remove()` also refers to `Group#removeActor(Actor)`, but actually calls only `Group#removeActor(Actor, boolean)`\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\n``` java\r\nActor actor = new Actor();\r\nContainer container =

I put following profiling code in the `mainLoop` ([at this line](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/backends/gdx-backend-lwjgl/src/com/badlogic/gdx/backends/lwjgl/LwjglApplication.java#L158)):\r\n```java\r\nwhile (running) {\r\n    ...\r\n    _profiling.start();\r\n    Display.processMessages();\r\n    _profiling.end();\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd got this:\r\n<img width=\"221\" alt=\"__3\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1666014/23096754/bb060a2a-f62b-11e6-8b0c-f59e63d9434a.png\">\r\n\r\nAs you can see here, `messages` graph is almost equal to the `dt`.
