Aside from implementing that ability, another simpler proposed change that could be made with the AssetManager would be to allow \"putting\" of custom assets with a K-V pair. This would allow for the creation of the custom \"atlased\" font, and then putting it under its appropriate font path key for use. Obviously adding the put function would sacrifice some data safety (people unfamiliar with the API could corrupt their assets with incorrectly loaded and then cached data), but this should be the easier fix.\n\nOf course, another solution again would be to create a new AtlasedBitmapFont class which would essentially be a BitmapFont with a reference to a TextureAtlas with each region representing various font sizes (which is exactly what I am doing). This would forego the issues with the BitmapFontLoader and delegate those responsibilities to the AtlasedBitmapFont and AtlasedBitmapFontLoader classes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2091/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2090","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2090/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2090/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2090/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2090","id":37263579,"number":2090,"title":"Sprites & Sprite Fonts glitches on resume (context loss?)","user":{"login":"mbazaczek","id":3110617,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3110617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbazaczek","html_url":"https://github.com/mbazaczek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbazaczek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbazaczek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbazaczek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbazaczek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbazaczek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbazaczek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbazaczek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbazaczek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbazaczek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-07-07T12:21:10Z","updated_at":"2014-07-09T10:36:01Z","closed_at":"2014-07-09T10:35:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello there good chaps,\n\nLibGDX game on Android, sometimes when switching back to app this happens:\nhttp://imgur.com/vxgYTmA\nBut it should look like this: http://imgur.com/jycK5Dv\n\nIt happens on many devices (low-end Android 2.3 and high-end 4.4) and I am unable to replicate the conditions required for this bug to happen. I've researched this for quite a long time, and found info about the OpenGL context loss - but there are no dynamically generated textures here, I am loading a TextureAtlas packed by TexturePacker, via\n\n``` java\n// async loading\nassets.load(\"data/fonts/visitor26.fnt\", BitmapFont.class);\nassets.load(\"data/fonts/visitor52.fnt\", BitmapFont.class);\nassets.load(\"data/fonts/visitor128.fnt\", BitmapFont.class);\n\nTextureAtlasParameter param = new TextureAtlasParameter();\nparam.flip = true;\nassets.load(\"data/tex/demonteeth.pack\", TextureAtlas.class, param);\nassets.load(\"data/tex/sprites.pack\", TextureAtlas.class, param);\n```\n\nIf I am correct, textures should be now managed by LibGDX.\nThen, of course, i'm getting TextureAtlases objects to extract sprites later:\n\n``` java\nvisitor26 = assets.get(\"data/fonts/visitor26.fnt\", BitmapFont.class);\nvisitor52 = assets.get(\"data/fonts/visitor52.fnt\", BitmapFont.class);\nvisitor128 = assets.get(\"data/fonts/visitor128.fnt\", BitmapFont.class);\nbg = assets.get(\"data/tex/demonteeth.pack\", TextureAtlas.class);\nsprites = assets.get(\"data/tex/sprites.pack\", TextureAtlas.class);\n```\n\nThe class that holds the TextureAtlases IS NOT static (as I've read that causes problems on Android) and I re-create it if it's lost - by invoking this method in onStart() and onResume() in my libgdx app\n\n``` java\npublic static void restoreRenderer(Camera camera, Camera fontcamera) {\n        if (r==null){\n        r = new Renderer();\n        }\n        r.setCamera(camera);\n        r.setFontCamera(fontcamera);\n    }\n```\n\n..but the Renderer object itself is held in a static field in the main game class:\n\n``` java\npublic class Core {\n    public static Renderer r;\n//moar code\n}\n```\n\nMy ultimate question to awesome libgdx devs: is there any way to detect OpenGL context loss? If that's possible, I would simply force reloading of the TextureAtlases :) I've researched this issue, but found no cure for this... Wiki also is silent :(\n\nXoxo, and have a nice day! \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2089","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2089/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2089/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2089/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2089","id":37259585,"number":2089,"title":"quick fix for scene2d debug memory leak","user":{"login":"jrenner","id":1393288,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1393288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrenner","html_url":"https://github.com/jrenner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrenner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrenner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrenner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrenner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrenner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrenner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrenner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrenner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrenner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2014-07-07T11:16:15Z","updated_at":"2014-07-08T04:22:33Z","closed_at":"2014-07-08T04:22:33Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/2089","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2089","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2089.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2089.patch"},"body":"fixes #2013\n\nI just removed the app check.
