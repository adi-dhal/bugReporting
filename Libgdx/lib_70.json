Format](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/wiki/TMX-Map-Format#tile-flipping) the flip information of the tile is being saved withing the gid property for the tile.\n\nIn my case the object was saved as `<object id=\"80\" name=\"ASDASDSD\" gid=\"2147483751\" x=\"66\" y=\"626\"/>`, and this number can't be parsed by the Integer class in Java and results in an exception.\n\nNote that when not fliped the gid number is saved as an integer `<object id=\"80\" name=\"ASDASDSD\" gid=\"103\" x=\"66\" y=\"626\"/>` and the exception doesn't happen.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2833/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2832","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2832/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2832/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2832/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2832","id":57209003,"number":2832,"title":"Environment

But I can not find any solution.\nI want to pitch a little Music during its use (like the game Timbeman). So i have reduced a lot its quality and used it as a Sound played in loop. \nNow i can play the sound and pitch it on the fly. It works on the Desktop, Android and iOS but on the Android there is an issue : \nThe sound ends earlier and loops to early.\nNotice that in my code I am pitching the sound 2 times for the moment with 4 seconds between.\n\n(ps : I tried to chain different small shunks of the music but there is this well known gap between the shunks on Android so this is impossible this way).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2828","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2828/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2828/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2828/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2828","id":57068781,"number":2828,"title":"Removed gdx-pay dependencies.","user":{"login":"davebaol","id":2366334,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2366334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol","html_url":"https://github.com/davebaol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-02-09T18:19:35Z","updated_at":"2015-02-09T18:24:25Z","closed_at":"2015-02-09T18:21:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/2828","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2828","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2828.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2828.patch"},"body":"Since gdx-pay is an external extension I think that these dependencies do not belong here.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2827","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2827/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2827/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2827/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2827","id":57041073,"number":2827,"title":"Third party extensions to be read from XML file (gdx-setup)","user":{"login":"azakhary","id":2115888,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2115888?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/azakhary","html_url":"https://github.com/azakhary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azakhary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azakhary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azakhary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azakhary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azakhary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azakhary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azakhary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azakhary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azakhary/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":17,"created_at":"2015-02-09T14:59:28Z","updated_at":"2017-01-16T14:55:53Z","closed_at":"2015-02-14T04:39:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/2827","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2827","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2827.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2827.patch"},"body":"As discussed yesterday per #2822 setup app required some sort of way to separate third party extensions from main extensions in a different dialog. The other part was for list of third party extensions to be read from an XML file that can be later modified with pull requests. Lastly it was needed to make sure it is clear for user that third party extensions are not maintained by libgdx team.\n\nThis is a bit of a big change, so I it probably requires to take a look on it in depth, to test it, and make sure all is correct and the way it should be before this can be considered to be merged. I do not expect it to be merged right away of course.\n\nWould love comments! Maybe some text changes?\n\nNotes / potential issues:\n1) The list is currently does not use scroll pane, because at this moment there is just one extension and I was not sure how will it look in future when others add their own. (this can be fixed in later prs)\n2) Each extension can contain only one dependency per platform. I am not sure what actual real life examples for others might be though, and what we want to allow?\n3) Do you guys require heavy commenting? the rest of code was not commented.\n4) Swing is a nightmare to make look good.

do:\n\nfont.setUseIntegerPositions(false);\n\nAnd for some others I think there exists setRounding(boolean).\n\nIt is not a problem if it can't be added, Just that I spent some time trying fix the
