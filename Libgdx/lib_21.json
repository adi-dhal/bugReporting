Add support for null String.\n   If you pass a null string to a native method, JVM will crash.\n2. Allow use GetXXXArrayElements as option to read/write primitive arrays.\n   Current jnigen uses GetPrimitiveArrayCritical for all primitive array in JNI side.\n   But GetPrimitiveArrayCritical has some constraints, as stalling GC. Would be nice to be able to chose one or other.\n#### Reproduction steps/code\n\nTo reproduce null String error just compile and run [MyJniClass2](https://github.com/AlessandroBorges/libgdx/blob/master/extensions/gdx-jnigen/src/com/badlogic/gdx/jnigen/test/MyJniClass2.java).\n\nThere is no bug with GetPrimitiveArrayCritical, just an enhancement. \n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\n\nAll.\n#### Stacktrace for null String\n\n>  A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:\n>   EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION (0xc0000005) at pc=0x000000006a9f3982, pid=1464, tid=6368\n>  JRE version: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (8.0_77-b03) (build 1.8.0_77-b03)\n>  Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (25.77-b03 mixed mode windows-amd64 compressed oops)\n>  Problematic frame:\n>  V  [jvm.dll+0x143982]\n> \n>  Failed to write core dump.

will help clean up skin json files considerably. A prime use case is ImageButtonStyle (or ImageTextButtonStyle)--I find it is common to have many ImageButtonStyles in my skin with all the same values except for the Image. But I also have many other types of Button subclass styles where I am using some of the same values over and over. It becomes error prone to make tweaks to these parameters and keep the visual look of all the buttons the same.\r\n\r\nUsage: For any style definition, you can specify a `parent` in the Json that names another style to use for default values. The parent can be a superclass style, so a TextButtonStyle could use a ButtonStyle as a parent, for example. You then only need to specify parameters that have different values than those of the parent.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4287/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4286","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4286/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4286/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4286/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4286","id":174391117,"number":4286,"title":"Fix #4281 - Wrong drag actor position","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-08-31T22:08:37Z","updated_at":"2016-09-16T12:13:50Z","closed_at":"2016-09-16T12:13:50Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/4286","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4286","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4286.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4286.patch"},"body":"I think drag actor should be positioned at the mouse position by default, this also fix #4281\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4286/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4285","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4285/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4285/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4285/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4285","id":174357445,"number":4285,"title":"Broken links in wiki","user":{"login":"moonwolf-github","id":10871358,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10871358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonwolf-github","html_url":"https://github.com/moonwolf-github","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonwolf-github/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonwolf-github/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonwolf-github/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonwolf-github/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonwolf-github/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonwolf-github/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonwolf-github/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonwolf-github/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonwolf-github/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-08-31T19:26:59Z","updated_at":"2016-08-31T22:21:39Z","closed_at":"2016-08-31T22:21:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"There are several links to images in https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Mesh,-color-&-texture all directing to http://libgdx.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/img/... - which gives 404 error.

The \"after\" file with this fix renders correctly for me.\n[arial-after-fix.txt](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/files/446252/arial-after-fix.txt)\n[arial-before-fix.txt](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/files/446251/arial-before-fix.txt)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4281","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4281/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4281/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4281/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4281","id":173893238,"number":4281,"title":"DragAndDrop's Payload Actor Position is incorret","user":{"login":"Alchemist0823","id":4423239,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4423239?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alchemist0823","html_url":"https://github.com/Alchemist0823","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alchemist0823/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alchemist0823/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alchemist0823/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alchemist0823/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alchemist0823/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alchemist0823/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alchemist0823/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alchemist0823/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alchemist0823/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-08-29T23:03:43Z","updated_at":"2016-09-16T12:13:50Z","closed_at":"2016-09-16T12:13:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"DragAndDrop's Payload Actor Position is incorret\n#### Issue details\n\n```\nfloat dragActorX = 14, dragActorY = -20;\n```\n\nhard coded position in DragAndDrop.java\n#### Reproduction steps/code\n\nRun DragAndDrop Demo\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\n\n1.9.2 +\n#### Stacktrace\n\n``` java\n//Please provide the stacktrace if applicable \n```\n#### Please select the affected platforms\n- [x] Android\n- [x] iOS (robovm)\n- [x] iOS (MOE)\n- [x] HTML/GWT\n- [x] Windows\n- [x] Linux\n- [x] MacOS\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4280","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4280/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4280/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4280/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4280","id":173862223,"number":4280,"title":"[WIP]Support for gradle 2.5+","user":{"login":"arnoid","id":1614789,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1614789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnoid","html_url":"https://github.com/arnoid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnoid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnoid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnoid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnoid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnoid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnoid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnoid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnoid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnoid/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-08-29T20:16:50Z","updated_at":"2016-08-29T21:01:51Z","closed_at":"2016-08-29T20:18:44Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/4280","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4280","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4280.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4280.patch"},"body":"!!!WARNING!!!!!
