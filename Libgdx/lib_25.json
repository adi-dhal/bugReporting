However the first time the sorter is ran for any renderable they are sorted incorrectly. Not only is this functionally incorrect, but it has the impact of unnecessary mesh pool requests/allocations which can cause lag as objects enter the camera frustum.\n\nI included several test scenarios shown in runTests(). The ArrayList is always able to sort the renderables correctly. However the first time the Array sorts renderables of different VertexAttributes it will fail to sort them correct, shown in the Test 1 output.\n\nThe render function is not important for the test results but it may be useful in showing what the test is trying to accomplish. In this case it is render a grid of blocks, some of which have a packed color component and other that do not (causing them to have two different types of VertexAttributes). These should be able to be built as 2 meshes (1 swap) but instead require 4 meshes (3 swaps). As the number of renderables are increased the number of uncessary extra meshes can reach well over 100.\n#### Reproduction steps/code\n\nSingle file test case:\n\n```\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.Comparator;\n\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.ApplicationAdapter;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.Gdx;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.InputMultiplexer;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.Color;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.GL20;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.PerspectiveCamera;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.VertexAttributes;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.VertexAttributes.Usage;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g3d.Environment;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g3d.Material;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g3d.Model;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g3d.ModelBatch;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g3d.ModelCache;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g3d.ModelInstance;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g3d.Renderable;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g3d.attributes.ColorAttribute;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g3d.environment.DirectionalLight;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g3d.utils.CameraInputController;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g3d.utils.DefaultShaderProvider;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g3d.utils.MeshPartBuilder;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g3d.utils.ModelBuilder;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g3d.utils.shapebuilders.BoxShapeBuilder;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.utils.Array;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.utils.Logger;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.utils.Pool;\n\npublic class ModelCacheTest extends ApplicationAdapter {\n\n    private ModelCache modelCache;\n    private ModelBuilder modelBuilder = new ModelBuilder();\n    private Array<ModelInstance> instances0 = new Array<ModelInstance>();\n    private Array<ModelInstance> instances1 = new Array<ModelInstance>();\n\n    private Array<Model> models = new Array<Model>();\n\n    private Logger logger = new Logger(\"LOG\", Logger.INFO);\n    public PerspectiveCamera cam;\n    public CameraInputController inputController;\n    public ModelBatch modelBatch;\n    public Environment environment;\n\n    private final Comparator<Renderable> comparator = new ModelCache.Sorter();\n\n\n    private Pool<Renderable> fakeRenderablesPool = new Pool<Renderable>() {\n        @Override\n        protected Renderable newObject() {\n            return new Renderable();\n        }\n    };\n\n    @Override\n    public void create() {\n        modelBatch = new ModelBatch(new DefaultShaderProvider());\n\n        environment = new Environment();\n        environment.set(new ColorAttribute(ColorAttribute.AmbientLight, .4f,\n                .4f, .4f, 1f));\n        environment.add(new DirectionalLight().set(0.8f, 0.8f, 0.8f, -1f,\n                -0.8f, -0.2f));\n\n        cam = new PerspectiveCamera(67, Gdx.graphics.getWidth(),\n                Gdx.graphics.getHeight());\n        cam.position.set(10f, 10f, 10f);\n        cam.lookAt(0, 0, 0);\n        cam.near = 1f;\n        cam.far = 30f;\n        cam.update();\n\n        Gdx.input.setInputProcessor(new InputMultiplexer(\n                inputController = new CameraInputController(cam)));\n\n        this.modelCache = new ModelCache();\n\n        Material materialRed = new Material();\n        Material materialBlue = new Material();\n        Material materialBlueDuplicate = new Material();\n        Material materialGreen = new Material();\n\n        materialRed.set(ColorAttribute.createDiffuse(Color.RED));\n        materialBlue.set(ColorAttribute.createDiffuse(Color.BLUE));\n        materialGreen.set(ColorAttribute.createDiffuse(Color.GREEN));\n        materialBlueDuplicate.set(ColorAttribute.createDiffuse(Color.BLUE));\n\n        final int usageBasic = Usage.Position | Usage.Normal;\n        final int usageBasicColor = Usage.Position | Usage.ColorPacked | Usage.Normal;\n\n        models.add(buildCubeModel(materialRed, usageBasic));\n        models.add(buildCubeModel(materialRed, usageBasicColor));\n        models.add(buildCubeModel(materialBlue, usageBasic));\n        models.add(buildCubeModel(materialBlue, usageBasicColor));\n        models.add(buildCubeModel(materialBlueDuplicate, usageBasic));\n        models.add(buildCubeModel(materialBlueDuplicate, usageBasicColor));\n        models.add(buildCubeModel(materialGreen, usageBasic));\n        models.add(buildCubeModel(materialGreen, usageBasicColor));\n\n\n        for (int i = 0, s = models.size;

All textures scale fine but the fonts look weird. After hours of testing I manage to figure out that it is because of the combined matrix because when I comment the line SpriteBatch.setProjectionMatrix(Camera.combined) the text renders fine, but it does not scale my app to different screen sizes.  I tested it on Android too though and the text looked better on my phone (except for one italic font which also looked weird), I thought this was because the phone is of a resolution higher than 720p but that does not seem to be the case since running the Desktop version of my app in 720p does not help the text render any better.\n\n![5bd2d13daa705f214c2dda965e852921](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15983269/16713971/cf3f30f6-46be-11e6-9992-7db121aafc72.png)\nText rendering with problems when using combined

The behavior of LibGDX viewports as being described in this issue is causing some inconveniences. First there's the necessity to set `screenX` and `screenY` and call `apply()` after calling `update()` and secondly some of the Viewport types, such as FitViewport, won't update correctly so `screenX`, `screenY`, `screenWidth` and `screenHeight` had to be recalculated. These issues made me consider not to utilize LibGDX Viewports, but maybe that wouldn't be necessary.\n\n@nooone mentioned that the current behavior of LibGDX Viewports is intended because they ought to be positioned at the center of the screen, when updated. I would like to suggest to change this behavior so Viewports, such us ExtendViewport, StretchViewport and FitViewport (ScalingViewports) are centered relatively to their position and size. Also ScreenViewport wouldn't always be at the left bottom corner. The old behavior would still apply if the position would be (0, 0) and the size would be the same as the size of the screen.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4174","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4174/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4174/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4174/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4174","id":162836197,"number":4174,"title":"Avoid creating LIBGDX Window on create method","user":{"login":"kapcip","id":4949721,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4949721?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapcip","html_url":"https://github.com/kapcip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapcip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapcip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapcip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapcip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapcip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapcip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapcip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapcip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapcip/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-06-29T03:58:49Z","updated_at":"2016-06-29T16:33:45Z","closed_at":"2016-06-29T05:57:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I want to use LIBGDX on the server side to create animation using **Universal Tween Engine**: [http://www.aurelienribon.com/blog/projects/universal-tween-engine/](url)\n\nProblem is when we use LIBGDX it always calls create method (life cycle method) and opens up the Window.

I want to avoid that window to be shown up so that I can do animation silently at the backend.\n\nI am using LIBGDX 1.6.1 and OS X 10.10\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4173","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4173/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4173/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4173/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4173","id":162391139,"number":4173,"title":"Warning: Class 'com.foo.DesktopLauncher' not found in module 'desktop' immediately after following setup directions","user":{"login":"johndanek","id":6955277,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6955277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johndanek","html_url":"https://github.com/johndanek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johndanek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johndanek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johndanek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johndanek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johndanek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johndanek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johndanek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johndanek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johndanek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-06-27T07:40:48Z","updated_at":"2016-07-06T19:09:02Z","closed_at":"2016-07-01T02:02:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#### Issue details\n\nI followed the instructions at https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Project-Setup-Gradle so I have a brand new, blank libgdx project. I am now attempting to follow the instructions at https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Gradle-and-Intellij-IDEA to run this blank program. I am using IntelliJ and am getting stuck at the Running Your Project -> Desktop section.\n\nIf I follow the steps described, when I select the DesktopLauncher class, there is an error at the bottom of the window saying \"Warning: Class 'com.foo.DesktopLauncher' not found in module 'desktop'\". I can't seem to get around this. If I click Apply then Ok, then attempt to run, the program crashes with the same error in a stack trace:\n\n``` java\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.foo.DesktopLauncher\n    at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:381)\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:424)\n    at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:331)\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:357)\n    at java.lang.Class.forName0(Native Method)\n    at java.lang.Class.forName(Class.java:264)\n    at com.intellij.rt.execution.application.AppMain.main(AppMain.java:122)\n```\n\nIt is interesting to note that when I click on the button to choose the main class, it does not appear under the Search By Name list. It is a selection of 30 classes in the standard sun library, starting with the letters A-C. If I set \"Use classpath of module\" to <no module>, my main class DOES appear under the Main class -> Search by Name list.

Thinking it was the timestep, I tried many different things, but eventually found that for whatever reason Libgdx was just occasionally getting really high frame times, accompanied with FPS drop. As a test, I made a new blank Libgdx project with no tools checked and nothing but Desktop selected. This new project still had the occasional high frame times and FPS drops.\n#### Reproduction steps/code\n\nI've tested this on four different computers, all with the same results. This doesn't seem to be a universal problem (as many people have successfully developed with Libgdx), but I did find some threads (I would link, but I can't seem to find them right now) on the forums about what sounds like a similar issue, but they didn't come to a resolution. Below is a barebones version of the code I was using to see the problem. For my game I wanted vSync disabled and the framerate to be unlimited, but the problem occurs regardless of whether vSync is enabled or the framerate is limited. I've also included some logs of the output of the run of the below program. I've put the in delta time seconds, only so it's easier to read.\n\n``` java\npublic class Barebones extends ApplicationAdapter {\n\n    private float time;\n\n    public void create () {\n\n    }\n\n    public void render () {\n        Gdx.gl.glClear(GL20.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);\n        time = Gdx.graphics.getRawDeltaTime();\n        System.out.print((time*1000)+\", \");\n        if((time*1000)>2f){\n            System.out.print(\"High Frame Time\");\n        }\n        System.out.println();\n    }\n\n    public static void main (String[] args) throws Exception {\n        LwjglApplicationConfiguration config = new LwjglApplicationConfiguration();\n        config.vSyncEnabled = false;\n        config.foregroundFPS = 0;\n        new LwjglApplication(new Barebones(), config);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n[Log1](https://paste.ee/p/schUb)\n[Log2](https://paste.ee/p/4HX1S)\n[Log3](https://paste.ee/p/vQonj)\nThe logs are quite large; I recommend just Ctrl+F and look for the word High.

This means the btRaycastVehicle only works if collision groups and filters are never used in the world.  This is briefly discussed on the Bullet forums:\nhttp://bulletphysics.org/Bullet/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=5494&start=0\n#### Reproduction steps/code\n\nThis can be observed by creating a modified VehicleTest:\n\n```\npublic class VehicleFilterTest extends VehicleTest {\n\n    @Override\n    public BulletWorld createWorld() {\n        //Force all objects to same collision group and filter\n        final short filterGroup = (1 << 11);\n        final short filterMask = filterGroup;\n\n        BulletWorld filterWorld = new BulletWorld() {\n            @Override\n            public void add (final BulletEntity entity) {\n            super.add(entity);\n            if (entity.body != null) {\n                if (entity.body instanceof btRigidBody)\n                    ((btDiscreteDynamicsWorld)collisionWorld).addRigidBody((btRigidBody)entity.body,filterGroup,filterMask);\n                else\n                    collisionWorld.addCollisionObject(entity.body,filterGroup,filterMask);\n                // Store the index of the entity in the collision object.\n                entity.body.setUserValue(entities.size - 1);\n            }\n            }\n        };\n        return filterWorld;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe fix is to override the rayCast() function of the btVehicleRaycaster that is given in the btRaycastVehicle constructor and set the collision group and filter of the ray before performing a rayTest.\n\nI wrote out what _should_ be potential solution below. Only the new setCollisionFilterMask(int) and setCollisionFilterGroup(int) functions would have to be exposed through the JNI.\n\n```\n//------------------------------
