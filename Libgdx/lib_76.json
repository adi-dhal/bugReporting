everyone,\nI found something very strange in the Bullet implementation of Libgdx.\n\nIf you have a constraint `btTypedConstraint`, and you want to get the rigid body inside that constraint, you can use `getRigidBodyA()` or `getRigidBodyB()`.\n\nTheses methods return the `btRigidBody` by creating a new `btRigidBody` at the same pointer address (If I understand well).\n\n``` java\npublic btRigidBody getRigidBodyA() {\n    return new btRigidBody(DynamicsJNI.btTypedConstraint_getRigidBodyA__SWIG_0(swigCPtr, this), false);\n}\n```\n\nThe problem is that the original `btRigidBody` at this address loose some informations like `btRigidBody.setContactCallbackFlag(FLAG);`. Contact listener doesn't work after that.\n\nIt's very annoying because `getRigidBodyA` has a bad side effect and modify the original `btRigidBody`.\nI know it's difficult because Java don't know the C objects but maybe there is a solution.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2647","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2647/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2647/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2647/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2647","id":52025665,"number":2647,"title":"AndroidMusic - should it reset before releasing?","user":{"login":"Magnesus","id":3584532,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3584532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Magnesus","html_url":"https://github.com/Magnesus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Magnesus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Magnesus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Magnesus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Magnesus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Magnesus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Magnesus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Magnesus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Magnesus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Magnesus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-12-15T19:08:32Z","updated_at":"2014-12-23T13:19:51Z","closed_at":"2014-12-23T13:19:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/backends/gdx-backend-android/src/com/badlogic/gdx/backends/android/AndroidMusic.java - before release, shouldn't there be reset?

This would be a great feature to add to the growing list of 3D animation capabilities of LibGDX.\n\nThe fbx-conv tool would need updating as well, so I created https://github.com/libgdx/fbx-conv/issues/73\n\nThere are two elements to blend shape animations in the FBX format:\n1. Definitions of the blend shapes themselves\n2. Combining these blend shapes via keyframed animations\n## Proposed Implementation\n\nA proposed interface would be added to `ModelInstance`, which would need to hold a list of `BlendShapes` (new class). \n\nUsage:\n\n```\nModelInstance player = new ModelInstance(model);\n// Apply blend shape \"blink-left\" to base mesh with 50% influence\nplayer.getBlendShape(\"blink-left\").setWeight(50); \n\n// Apply blend shape \"blink-right\" to base mesh with 100% influence\nplayer.getBlendShape(\"blink-right\").setWeight(100);\n```\n\nIn this example, the resulting mesh would have a \"half blinked\" left eye combined with a \"fully blinked\" right eye. Blend shapes can be combined and would only override each other if they affect the same vertices. In this case, the final position of the vertex would be affected by all active blend shapes.\n\nA convenience method could be used to reset all blend shapes at once:\n\n```\n// Resets all blend shape weights to 0 in this ModelInstance\nplayer.resetBlendShapes();\n```\n\nThe `ModelInstance` would likely need to keep track of the \"base\" or \"neutral\" blend shape, to allow returning to the default state of the mesh.\n\nOnce blend shape control is implemented, animations could easily be performed in code by tweening the blend shape weights over time (ie: using Universal Tween Engine).\n## FBX Format Details\n\nUsing the Blender ASCII FBX exporter with a very simple model (12 verts), the following format is used to define blend shapes (only relevant parts included):\n\n```\nObjects:  {\n    Model: \"Model::Cylinder\", \"Mesh\" {\n        Shape: \"twist\" {\n            Indexes: 1,3,5,7,8,9,10,11\n            Vertices: -0.866025,-0.500000,0.000000,-0.500000,0.866025,0.000000,0.866026,0.500000,0.000000,0.500000,-0.866025,0.000000,\n                          -0.500000,-0.133975,0.000000,-0.133975,0.500000,0.000000,0.500000,0.133975,0.000000,0.133975,-0.500000,0.000000\n            Normals: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,\n            0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe locations of the vertices are relative to their original locations.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2632","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2632/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2632/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2632/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2632","id":51271206,"number":2632,"title":"RoboVM -

When several Groups on the scene have their ow transformations, the normal SpriteBatch will lead to many render calls. However simple replacement of SpriteBatch to CpuSpriteBatch often leads to error: Can't invert a singular affine matrix or to the loss of elements position precessions.\n\nThis happens when the first setTransform call happens when batch is not in the drawing state. If this first call occurs for for Group (for example) with setScale(0f), then the group will not be able to resetTransform  at the end of draw method with the error: Can't invert a singular affine matrix. This is clear because setScale(0f) will lead to singular matrix. If the same happens with very-very small scale, then position precision will be lost. The bad thing is that it is connected just with the first setTransform call, disregarding the hierarchy of the objects.\n\nThe proposal is to remove if (isDrawing()) checks in both setTransform methods of CpuSpriteBatch and always apply adjustAffine. If someone really need to set GPU transform, one can make couple of special public methods to set them with implicit batch flash (like SpriteBath does).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2629","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2629/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2629/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2629/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2629","id":51192016,"number":2629,"title":"Move
