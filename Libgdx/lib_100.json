the process of creating my frame buffers, so I may use GLSL shaders to perform blur behind UI elements, I've encountered a problem where transparent actors in a stage(s) end up overlapping when rendering to a frame buffer.  \n\nFor some reason, the actors will completely crop away what's behind them instead of multiplying properly when they're rendered within a frame buffer, like in this image\n\n![screenshot - 06022014 - 12 21 01 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/316728/3143886/7a015c72-ea0e-11e3-9132-bd31dc610bfc.png)\n\nWhen rendering without being wrapped into a frame

This commit is a simple but dirty fix for this, allowing you to pass a prefix to be added to the image name. In the example above, you'd pass \"game\" as a prefix.\n\nA real fix would be to add real atlas support directly in the particle editor, allowing you to load an atlas, and choose an image from it.

latest libGDX nightlies on Desktop I am experiencing a strange issue. It seems to me this could be a bug in libGDX. But I am not 100% sure, so I would like to hear your opinion.\n\nSo in my game I am rendering TextureRegions as tiles side by side in a grid to get the ground plane. When the player clicks somewhere on the screen with the mouse, the main character is moving to that location, and the camera is following him. In other words: the main character always stays in the center of the screen / camera viewport while moving on the ground plane.\n\nI am using a world space different from screen space, so I initialise the camera like this:\n\n```\nvWidth = game.screenWidth / 32;\nvHeight = game.screenHeight / 32;\ncamera = new OrthographicCamera(vWidth, vHeight);\ncamera.position.set(vWidth / 2, vHeight / 2, 0f);\ncamera.update();\n```\n\nNow when the game starts with the camera on the initial position like shown above, everything is fine. The ground tiles are being rendered perfectly side by side, no gaps between them or anything. However, when the camera moves, then in some cases the tiles are not rendered perfectly any more, then I can see the background color shine through between all tiles as thin lines. In other words: In that case the tiles are rendered with gaps of 1-2 pixels in between them.\n\nThe drawing of the tiles is simple:\n\n```\n// final tileSize is the side length of one tile in world space, 2.0 in my case\nspriteBatch.draw(tex, x, y, tileSize, tileSize);\n```\n\nHowever, this happens even if I move the camera only a tiny little bit from its original position. For debugging I print out the x coordinates in world space used when drawing the tiles. And in both cases, the original camera position as well as the camera position after the move, the x values used in the spriteBatch are exactly the same, eg.:\n\n```\n984.0 986.0 988.0 990.0 992.0 994.0 996.0 998.0\n```\n\nSo I am wondering: If the drawing of tiles uses _exactly_ the same coordinates and size value in both cases, how can the problem with the background color shining through tiles only happen in some cases? Could it be related to the camera or viewport or anything like this?\n\nPS: I just found out that I can work around this issue by using this draw command:\n\n```\nspriteBatch.draw(tex, x, y, tileSize * 1.01, tileSize * 1.01);\n```\n\nI can live with that, but it doesn't seem to be real solution...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1906/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4899","x-ratelimit-reset":"1506844633","x-github-request-id":"C300:110A:248DF1B:40D8E93:59D09650","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=101>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=164>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=99>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"5c1dfa5882e19e7271b9dc5f0971dd70\"","status":"200 OK"}}
