But who cares. Be honest, have you ever used it? :) \n- you can't specify the ClassLoader anymore, which is something needed only by servlet containers and stuff like that, I guess. This should help to make it gwt compatible, but I'm a noob with gwt so it's just speculation.\n\nThen I've implemented a FileControl class that can work with any gdx FileType and any encoding. If you don't specify any control when creating a bundle a default control is used, i.e. a FileControl with FileType.Internal and ISO-8859-1 encoding.\nUsers can also implement their own control class to support other sources (e.g. http instead of file system) and formats (e.g. xml instead of properties).\n\nWhen it's finished - it works already for desktop and adroid platforms but some code cleanup is needed - I'll do a pull request if you're interested in.\nIn this case I'll need your help to support the gwt backend too.\nWhat do you think?

This could be done via the `btCollisionDispatcher.needsCollision(btCollisionObject, btCollisionObject)` and `btCollisionDispatcher.needsResponse(btCollisionObject, btCollisionObject)`. They are basically equivalent to the Box2D `ContactFilter.shouldCollide(Fixture, Fixture)`, where one can also access the userData via `fixture.getUserData()`.\n\nCurrently a `CustomCollisionDispatcher extends btCollisionDispatcher` is not recognized by the native code and no callbacks to the custom dispatcher takes place. For very complex games with many different entities which can collide with each other, or can't, or sometimes can, or collide after a delay etc., the usual broadphase filtering isn't powerful enough anymore and finding a valid filtermask based solution would become extremely hard to maintain.\n\nThus it would be great if the libgdx <-> bullet bridge could handle custom collision

If you are sure you're not intentionally defining a\n    core class, then this is the most likely explanation of what's\n    going on.\n    However, you might actually be trying to define a class in a core\n    namespace, the source of which you may have taken, for example,\n    from a non-Android virtual machine project. This will most\n    assuredly not work. At a minimum, it jeopardizes the\n    compatibility of your app with future versions of the platform.\n    It is also often of questionable legality.\n    If you really intend to build a core library -- which is only\n    appropriate as part of creating a full virtual machine\n    distribution, as opposed to compiling an application -- then use\n    the \"--core-library\" option to suppress this error message.\n    If you go ahead and use \"--core-library\" but are in fact\n    building an application, then be forewarned that your application\n    will still fail to build or run, at some point. Please be\n    prepared for angry customers who find, for example, that your\n    application ceases to function once they upgrade their operating\n    system. You will be to blame for this problem.\n    If you are legitimately using some code that happens to be in a\n    core package, then the easiest safe alternative you have is to\n    repackage that code. That is, move the classes in question into\n    your own package namespace. This means that they will never be in\n    conflict with core system classes. JarJar is a tool that may help\n    you in this endeavor. If you find that you cannot do this, then\n    that is an indication that the path you are on will ultimately\n    lead to pain, suffering, grief, and lamentation.\n    1 error; aborting\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1727/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1726","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1726/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1726/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1726/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1726","id":31829048,"number":1726,"title":"Precision problems with Intersector.intersectSegmentPolygon","user":{"login":"manuel-freire","id":2271676,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2271676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuel-freire","html_url":"https://github.com/manuel-freire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuel-freire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuel-freire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuel-freire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuel-freire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuel-freire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuel-freire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuel-freire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuel-freire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuel-freire/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2014-04-18T22:27:40Z","updated_at":"2014-04-25T07:10:52Z","closed_at":"2014-04-25T07:10:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Testcase: a 10x10 square (the polygon), and a segment from nearly-(9,9) to (20, 5): libgdx detects no intersection, although the first point is clearly inside and the second is outside:\n\n``` java\nPolygon p = new Polygon(new float[] {\n    0, 0, 10, 0, 10, 10, 0, 10\n});\n// these values fail.
