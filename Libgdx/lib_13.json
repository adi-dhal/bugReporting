fairly new to libgdx, so I could have simply missed something, but for some reason, the only asset I can load when running a html project is the default 'badlogic.jpg' image. \r\nI just downloaded the most recent setup jar, generated the project (I used tools and Box2d plugins), and imported the gradle project into intellij and did the other steps needed to start a desktop application, which works great. \r\nThis happens regardless if I have the android configuration checked. Even if I rename the file in the assets folder, it still loads on the webpage. But the really weird part is that if I delete every badlogic.jpg image in my entire project and restarting my ide and html server, it still loads on the webpage. My only guess it that something isn't updating, but I can't find what or how to fix it. \r\nFor example, if I try to load 'badlogics.jpg' (only by adding a 's' to the 'img = new Texture(\"badlogic.jpg\");' in the default code), the webpage spits out \r\n\"GwtApplication: exception: Couldn't load image 'badlogics.jpg',file does not exist\r\nCouldn't load image 'badlogics.jpg', file does not exist\"\r\neven if it really does exist in the assets folder.\r\nI have started the html project within the terminal with 'gradlew html:superDev' and with by ide and gradle by adding it as a run configuration, the setting for that are as follows \r\nGradle project: Game:html \r\nTasks: html:superDev\r\n\r\nI am on Windows 10, if that helps.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4543/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4542","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4542/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4542/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4542/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4542","id":200809290,"number":4542,"title":"Tiled

But all the function really needs is the combined mask, and since we keep the masks for both Attributes objects around anyway we can get it with just a bitwise or.\r\n\r\nOur game uses a large number of ModelInstances with about 15 shaders, which meant every time it added a renderable to the batch (several times per ModelInstance) it would have to iterate ~7 shaders on average and combineAttributes(..) for each one, which was a major hit to pre-render time.  Implementing this change brought the frame render time on our min spec phone from 40ms to 30ms, a major performance gain that made the game playable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4531/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4530","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4530/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4530/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4530/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4530","id":199978258,"number":4530,"title":"Add Mesh constructor for VertexAttributes","user":{"login":"cypherdare","id":1843131,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1843131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare","html_url":"https://github.com/cypherdare","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherdare/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-01-11T01:13:11Z","updated_at":"2017-03-08T21:37:20Z","closed_at":"2017-03-05T11:13:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/4530","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4530","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4530.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/4530.patch"},"body":"I was finding it kind of hacky to work around this missing constructor.
