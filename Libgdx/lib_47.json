lets you interrupt a currently running TemporalAction using the current rate of change as the starting rate of change for the new TemporalAction. Typically, if you need to add a new MoveToAction to an object that is already moving, there is a jarring change in velocity as the new Action begins its interpolation. Now you can take the old MoveToAction or MoveByAction and pass it to the new Action to automatically start the new Action at the same speed as the interrupted Action was currently moving.\n\nThis change to the Actions requires a different start speed for each component of the temporal action (for example, X and Y). As such there is an impact of one additional `if` statement in the `update` method of TemporalAction.\n\nI added interfaces for MoveAction, RotationAction, etc, to make it easier to find Actions that affect the same properties that should be interrupted, and to reduce the number of overloaded `setBlendFrom` methods.\n\nA typical usage:\n\n```\nvoid moveActor (Actor actor, float targetX, float targetY, float duration){\n    MoveAction interruptedAction = findMoveAction(actor);\n    MoveToAction newAction = Actions.moveTo(targetX, targetY, duration);\n    if (interruptedAction != null) newAction.setBlendFrom(interruptedAction, Interpolation.fade);\n    actor.removeAction(interruptedAction); //in case its duration was long enough to outlive new one\n    actor.addAction(newAction);\n}\n\nMoveAction findMoveAction(Actor actor){\n    for (Action a : actor.getActions())\n        if (action instanceof MoveAction) return (MoveAction)action;\n    return null;\n}\n```\n\nThere is a new SplineInterpolation subclass to signify the interpolations that support a starting speed. I added a `speed` method to all existing Interpolations so that any type of Interpolation can be smoothly interrupted.\n\nVideo comparison with and without blending from the interrupted interpolation:\nhttps://youtu.be/ZY_gq5k9lJE\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3521","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3521/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3521/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3521/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3521","id":114357369,"number":3521,"title":"[FreeTypeFontGenerator] texture bleeding","user":{"login":"JFixby","id":1580663,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1580663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFixby","html_url":"https://github.com/JFixby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFixby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFixby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFixby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFixby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFixby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFixby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFixby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFixby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFixby/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336982,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"badlogic","id":514052,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/514052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic","html_url":"https://github.com/badlogic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"badlogic","id":514052,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/514052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic","html_url":"https://github.com/badlogic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-10-30T21:15:22Z","updated_at":"2016-05-11T16:07:28Z","closed_at":"2016-05-11T16:07:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hello\n\nI render fonts produced with FreeTypeFontGenerator using Nearest filter and they look ugly:\n![nearest](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1580663/10858083/8d7e91a4-7f52-11e5-8274-d5e37d37d167.png)\n\nSo I switch to Linear filter and they start to bleed.

I've tracked this bug down to how a btBroadphasePair temporary instance is stored when trying to access an index in btBroadphasePairArray. It's an easy fix by storing the temporary btBroadphasePair instance in Java instead of C++. This doesn't change how the API is exposed and it looks like this is the desired behaviour anyway (see btBroadphasePair.java).\n\n```\n    /** Temporary instance, use by native methods that return a btBroadphasePair instance */\n    protected final static btBroadphasePair temp = new btBroadphasePair(0, false);\n    public static btBroadphasePair internalTemp(long cPtr, boolean own) {\n        temp.reset(cPtr, own);\n        return temp;\n    }\n```\n\nI'll add to this tomorrow with an example to reproduce the results, but the following three file changes fixes the issue ([this guy](http://www.badlogicgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=19830) had a similar issue).

Create fresh new project (can be only andorid, no need for ios, desktop or html)\n3. edit AndoridLauncher.java, add folowing comfig: `config.useImmersiveMode = true;` to enable \"full screen mode\"\n4. Set app to be portrait rather than landscape (In AndoridManifest.xml, set: `android:screenOrientation=\"portrait\"`)\n5. Build & Deploy\n6.
