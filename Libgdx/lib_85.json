I'm trying to render a `.tmx` tiled map using `TmxLoader` and `OrthogonalTiledMapRenderer`. The gist of it is that the width and height defined in my map _do not_ coincide with those of the tiles. So, in my `.tmx` file I have something like the following:\n\n```\n<map version=\"1.0\" orientation=\"orthogonal\" width=\"21\" height=\"10\" tilewidth=\"35\" tileheight=\"35\">\n <tileset firstgid=\"1\" name=\"tiles\" tilewidth=\"70\" tileheight=\"70\" spacing=\"2\" margin=\"2\">\n  <image source=\"tiles.png\" width=\"1874\" height=\"434\"/>\n </tileset>\n...\n```\n\n`tilewidth` and `tileheight` in `<map>` are half of what they are in `<tileset>`. That way, every texture region is 2x2 tiles in size.\n\nWith that setup, tiles are rendered ok, but **when the camera is moving to the right**, some unexpected gaps appear on every tile that leaves, or is about to leave, the screen. Like so:\n\n![tile-gap](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/476069/4382677/06fc3262-438f-11e4-850f-33b0ae4b75ba.png)\n\nThough I'm not entirely sure, this doesn't seem to be related to _texture bleeding_, which is also happening in my scenario (haven't corrected it, yet).\n\nI have already tried different spritesheet arrangements using `TexturePacker2` and [CodeAndWeb's TexturePacker](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker) (like inner padding, edge padding, extrude, square sizes, etc.), but no no avail. Also, this **does not occur if I create a new map with`tilewidth` and `tileheight` being the same as my tileset**. The very same spritesheet works as expected.\n\nSo, is there something I'm missing? Perhaps, some rounding errors related to the camera?  Is this even supported by the renderers in _libGDX_?

I'm using FBO (Frame buffer object) and open gl 2.0, the libgdx version is the last one up to date.\nThe game runs fine on windows machines and also on my android phone. But, when I run it in fedora, it behaves like that:\nhttp://s11.postimg.org/t2kmt0ipf/Captura_de_tela_de_2014_09_22_15_58_17.png\n\nAs opposed to a previous version of the game (the period where libgdx supported open gl 1.0), running on the same fedora machines. \nhttp://s16.postimg.org/j1aiiokv9/Captura_de_tela_de_2014_09_22_15_58_51.png\n\nI don't know if this issue is related to the open gl fact. Both versions are using shaders.\nAlso, I didn't used fbo at that time (on the previous version). Yet, that does not seem to be the root of the problem, since it runs perfectly even on my android device.\nI have yet to test on other linux distros to see if the issue persists.\n\nHere is a link of the game if you want to open it on your machine and provide feedback:\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/download/x7qqa3z5h4ilbsu/jogo37_frameskip=10-shadow=true.jar\n\nWhat may be happening?\nThanks in advance for the support.\n\nEDIT.: A friend of mine said he tested on OSX 10.9.4 and the same black screen occurred.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2366","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2366/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2366/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2366/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2366","id":43490858,"number":2366,"title":"Actor.setPosition with alignment","user":{"login":"mk1x86","id":4849383,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4849383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mk1x86","html_url":"https://github.com/mk1x86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mk1x86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mk1x86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mk1x86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mk1x86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mk1x86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mk1x86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mk1x86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mk1x86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mk1x86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-09-22T14:20:37Z","updated_at":"2014-09-22T17:51:09Z","closed_at":"2014-09-22T17:51:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Recent changes by @NathanSweet removed the method setCenterPosition and replaced it by an extended setPosition method which may except alignment as parameter.\n\nWhen using Align.center as alignment I'd expect the actor to be centered to the given coordinates. Instead, what happens is that the actor is offset by half the size in the wrong direction, i.e. instead of\n`x = x - width/2`\nthe formula \n`x = x + width/2`\nis used. I can't think of any scenario where this might be useful.

is my first \"real\" pull request..... so please be gentle ;)\nit is a proof of concept if i could implement an OUYA IAP backend for the abstraction layer of @noblemaster \nthis is more kind of a request for feedback and for our discussion.\n\ni havent done any cleaning, yet !!\nand i am not very experienced with listeners and callbacks......\n\nbut: in my game this works very good on ouya.\n\ni had to add some stuff to the config. this is how it looks in my OUYAresolver:\n\n```\n        config.setDeveloperID(OUYA_DEVELOPER_ID);\n        config.setApplicationKey(ouyaAPPLICATION_KEY);\n        config.addOffer(new Offer().setType(OfferType.ENTITLEMENT).setIdentifier(productID_TANKWAR_MULTIPLAYER));\n```\n\nbye\nphil\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2357/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2356","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2356/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2356/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2356/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2356","id":43315172,"number":2356,"title":"LibGDX

IOSGraphics.java, the code only handles device scale == 2. Since the 6+ has scale of 3, games are shrunk to a corner of the screen in the 6+. We need to modify this to simply multiply by the scale in all cases.\n\nThere is also a perhaps more subtle bug on the iPhone 6 in \"zoomed\" mode. In a similar way, the game is restricted to a corner of the screen. Not exactly sure here what the fix is, still diagnosing it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2356/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4914","x-ratelimit-reset":"1506844633","x-github-request-id":"AA76:110B:10E3A90:3D34217:59D095D3","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=86>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=164>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=84>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"c2084edcf93cb529d270fbdc2f5551c7\"","status":"200 OK"}}
