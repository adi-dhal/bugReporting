In this case most of the games use an kind of Eventhandler with GameEvents.\nI think it would be good to add Interfaces and maybe a DefaultGameEventHandler + GameEvent for this case. That might help people to implement their own Handler or use the provided from libgdx. For this i created fully generic interfaces + a full generic DefaultEventHandler which i would like to share with you.\nSo here is the HandlerInterface:\n\n``` Java\npublic interface GameEventHandler<I extends GameEvent<TYPE, ATT>, TYPE, ATT>{\n    public void handleEvent(final I... e);\n    public void registerListener(final GameEventListener<TYPE, ATT> listener,\n            final TYPE... type);\n    public void unregisterListener(\n            final GameEventListener<TYPE, ATT>... listener);\n    public void unregisterAllListener();\n    public void unregisterAllListener(final TYPE... type);\n    public void processEvents();\n    public void processEvents(final int maxTimeInMS);\n}\n```\n\nListenerInterface\n\n``` Java\npublic interface GameEventListener<TYPE, ATT> {\n    public void handleEvent(final GameEvent<TYPE, ATT> e);\n}\n```\n\nThe Generic GameEvent which is also Poolable:\n\n``` Java\npublic class GameEvent<TYPE, ATT> implements Poolable {\n\n    private TYPE type;\n    private HashMap<ATT, String> messages;\n\n    public void init(TYPE t) {\n        messages = new HashMap<ATT, String>();\n        type = t;\n    }\n\n    public TYPE getType() {\n        return type;\n    }\n\n    public void addMessages(ATT a, String value) {\n\n        messages.put(a, value);\n    }\n\n    public String getMessage(final ATT name) {\n        return messages.get(name) != null ? messages.get(name) : \"\";\n    }\n\n    public void clearMessages() {\n        messages.clear();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        String temp = \"[EVENT]\" + \"[\" + type.toString() + \"][\";\n        for (Entry<ATT, String> e : messages.entrySet()) {\n            temp += \"(\" + e.getKey().toString() + \":\" + e.getValue() + \")\";\n        }\n        temp += \"]\";\n        return temp;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void reset() {\n        clearMessages();\n        this.type = null;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd last but not least the default implementation:\n\n``` Java\npublic class DefaultGameEventHandler<I extends GameEvent<TYPE, ATT>, TYPE, ATT>\n        implements GameEventHandler<I, TYPE, ATT> {\n\n    private HashMap<TYPE, ArrayList<GameEventListener<TYPE, ATT>>> listeners;\n    private LinkedList<GameEvent<TYPE, ATT>> events;\n\n    public DefaultGameEventHandler() {\n        listeners = new HashMap<TYPE, ArrayList<GameEventListener<TYPE, ATT>>>();\n        events = new LinkedList<GameEvent<TYPE, ATT>>();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void handleEvent(final I... e) {\n        for (GameEvent<TYPE, ATT> event : e) {\n            events.push(event);\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void unregisterListener(\n            final GameEventListener<TYPE, ATT>... listener) {\n        for (GameEventListener<TYPE, ATT> l : listener) {\n            for (ArrayList<GameEventListener<TYPE, ATT>> set : listeners\n                    .values()) {\n                set.remove(l);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void processEvents() {\n        while (events.size() != 0) {\n            GameEvent<TYPE, ATT> e = events.pop();\n            for (GameEventListener<TYPE, ATT> l : listeners.get(e.getType())) {\n                l.handleEvent(e);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void processEvents(final int maxTimeInMS) {\n        final long starttime = TimeUtils.millis();\n        while (events.size() != 0) {\n            GameEvent<TYPE, ATT> e = events.pop();\n            for (GameEventListener<TYPE, ATT> l : listeners.get(e.getType())) {\n                l.handleEvent(e);\n            }\n            if (maxTimeInMS < TimeUtils.millis() - starttime) {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void registerListener(final GameEventListener<TYPE, ATT> listener,\n            TYPE... type) {\n        for (TYPE t : type) {\n            if (listeners.containsKey(type)) {\n                listeners.get(t).add(listener);\n            } else {\n                listeners.put(t, new ArrayList<GameEventListener<TYPE, ATT>>());\n                listeners.get(t).add(listener);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void unregisterAllListener() {\n        for (ArrayList<GameEventListener<TYPE, ATT>> l : listeners.values()) {\n            l.clear();\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void unregisterAllListener(final TYPE... type) {\n        for (TYPE event_Type : type) {\n            listeners.get(event_Type).clear();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf you like it ill provide the javadocs for it + an short explenation with using Enums for the generics. But some people might like Final static int for the Type or such so they can change it if they like. I can also create a pull request for it by the time.\n\nWhat do you think about it? This gives the people using libgdx the chance to have an fully asynchronous event system. You push all events into it, and call the process() inside of the Gameloop. Actors that implement the listen interface could also queue the events and handle them on the .act(). Moreover there is a method to process for a max time if someone uses multiple Threads and want to have a fixed time for processing events. This is commen used in games and i think such guideline would be good and usefull.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1393","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1393/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1393/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1393/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1393","id":28164758,"number":1393,"title":"Math
