multiple times I've wanted to add comments to the JSON skin file. Why? 1) To add headlines; 2) Add simple description of UI elements, although these are not as necessary; 3) Comments for variables, such as what do the Float bar_above_below_height do, where is it used?\n\nCurrently we (me and my designer) are using google docs to document each variable, what it does etc. This is quite a lot of duplicate work and it's cumbersome to just look-up the variable, what it does, and its value. As these three attributes are stored in two different files.\n\nAn easier approach would be to document the variable inside the JSON file.\n\n**Proposed solution**\nI've changed Skin and SkinLoader to remove all comments in the JSON file before sending it to the parser, but only if the functionality is wanted. I.e. I've added another constructor to SkinLoader and a new method to Skin. These works just as before if the user doesn't make use of these methods.\n\n**Possible enhancement**\nCreating new constructors for Skin that takes a boolean (much like new SkinLoader constructor). More efficient wrapper for removing JSON comments.\n\n**Thoughts**\nI'm not sure on the naming of the variables and methods. I also see this as a first draft and suggestion. I've implemented things as simple and understandable as I could, thus they might not be the most efficient.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1570","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1570/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1570/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1570/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1570","id":30368129,"number":1570,"title":"isKeyPressed right shift key always returns true after holding down both shift keys","user":{"login":"so3arbelnox","id":1444721,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1444721?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/so3arbelnox","html_url":"https://github.com/so3arbelnox","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/so3arbelnox/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/so3arbelnox/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/so3arbelnox/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/so3arbelnox/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/so3arbelnox/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/so3arbelnox/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/so3arbelnox/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/so3arbelnox/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/so3arbelnox/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336980,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":12,"created_at":"2014-03-28T07:42:56Z","updated_at":"2017-01-16T14:51:50Z","closed_at":"2014-05-03T18:21:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"What steps will reproduce the problem?\n1.

So I had to add support for OpenGL ES 2.0 in order to successfully run my app with the last nightly builds on Android 2.x.\n\nRelevant changes:\n- Added GLSurfaceViewAPI18 and GLSurfaceView20API18 which are slightly modified copies of android.opengl.GLSurfaceView from Android 4.3 source code (API 18) and GLSurfaceView20 respectively.\n- Added config property useGLSurfaceView20API18 (default false) which is effective only for API level <= 10, see createGLSurfaceView method.\n- Updated AndroidApplication, AndroidGraphics, and AndroidFragmentApplication classes (the last-named not tested though, sorry).\n- Removed some annoying warnings and fixed some javadoc typos.\n\nSuccessfully tested on the following devices that are not working for me with the last nightly builds:\n- Samsung Galaxy S Plus - Android 2.3.5 (API 10)\n- LG Optimus Net - Android 2.3.4 (API 10)\n- Samsung Galaxy SII - Android 2.3.3 (API 10)\n\nUnfortunately I have no devices having both Android 2.2 and OpenGL ES 2.0. However, I'm confident that it works because the old PR works perfectly with Android 2.2 and OpenGL ES 1.x.\n\nFinally, it looks like Daydream and LiveWallpaper classes have to be updated too, but I'm not sure it's worth.

LibGdx version is 0.9.9 (latest stable).\nThe issue is caused (again) by android's weird policy with keeping static objects over app restarts.\nThe following is a description what causes the problem to occur:\n- The app launches for the first time \n- `Timer` is creating its `TimerThread`\n- The thread registers itself as a `LifecycleListener`\n- The app is left (works best for me when I turn off the screen and wait for the device to be pattern-locked)\n- When the app is entered again, `onCreate` is called, leading to a new `initialize()ation`=> `Gdx.app` is new, with a new list of LifecycleListeners\n- `Timer.thread` is not null, for it \"statically survived\" => It is not being created in `Timer.instance.start` (the method itself probably isn't even called, because `instance` survived, too)\n- The timer's LifecycleListener methods are not invoked either, because the listener is not registered any more  \n\n=> The thread remains dead\n\nFor fixing the problem, I suggest setting `Timer.thread` to null in `Timer.TimerThread.pause`. If you are concerned about increased unnecessary `TimerThread` instantiations, one might as well keep a reference to the actual `Thread` which is created in `TimerThread.resume`, allowing to poll the thread's state in `Timer.instance`\n\n**Additional information:**\nStrangely, I was not able to reproduce this issue when being connected to the pc (i.e. a power source).
