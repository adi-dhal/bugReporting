Here's some code to replicate:\n\n``` java\npublic class I18NBundleIOSUnclosedResourceTest extends ApplicationAdapter {\n    @Override\n    public void create() {\n        I18NBundle bundle = I18NBundle.createBundle(Gdx.files.internal(\"i18nStub\"));\n        Gdx.app.log(\"key\", bundle.get(\"key\"));\n        Gdx.app.exit();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPut this into your _assets_ folder as `i18nStub.properties`:\n\n``` properties\nkey=value\n```\n\nThis should load the bundle, print `key: value` to the console and exit.\n\nSome more information from @mikemee who tested on an iOS device:\n\n> Fwiw, like all good memory bugs, it comes and gos. If I try and strip out everything it goes. If I try to binary-search to see exactly what trips it, then sometimes it will trip and other times it won't - with exactly the same code. However, with most stuff commented out in my IOSLauncher it will still trip, so I'm reasonably confident... I think part of the issue is that it terminates before the message can be emmitted. (As it is, sometimes the value/key message is mixed in with the error message).\n> \n> I did just switch to my faster device (ipad Mini instead of iPhone 4) and it did occur more frequently, with even more code stripped away. So I agree you should log it.

I was trying to make use of BufferUtils but I'm having difficulties.\n\nThing is, most methods call copyJNI, but also do additional checks (say, instanceof) or do operations in the buffers (flip buffer, set position, etc) that I'd rather do on my own instead of having to save the state of the buffer, then use BufferUtils, then restore as it was.\n\nThis stems from my usage of LibGDX which I understand it won't be the same for everyone. I already have my own buffer utils that I'm currently using, and I'm filling the gaps with LibGDX. Having copyJNI wrapped up in other \"convenience\" methods makes it harder to integrate into the code I already have (and I'd really like to try it out since I spend lots of time putting data in buffers before uploading them to UBOs).\n\nWhat do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2337/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2336","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2336/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2336/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2336/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2336","id":42728695,"number":2336,"title":"Add Usage.ColorUnpacked, deprecate Usage.Color.","user":{"login":"xoppa","id":2349087,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2349087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa","html_url":"https://github.com/xoppa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-09-14T19:51:59Z","updated_at":"2014-09-21T09:39:04Z","closed_at":"2014-09-21T09:39:04Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/2336","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2336","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2336.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2336.patch"},"body":"Related to #2015. \n`Usage.Color` is commonly used when e.g. using ModelBuilder to specify the vertex attributes to be build.
