look at the diff, it's huge and might crash your browser, instead look at the individual commits.\nThis breaks existing API (although it only requires fixing imports).\n\nA week or two ago [SWIG 3.0](http://sourceforge.net/p/swig/news/2014/03/swig-300-released/) is released. The (for the bullet wrapper) most important change is that nested classes are now supported. This is great, because bullet is full of nested classes and up until now we had to manually create a workaround for each nested class. This PR removes all previous workarounds and relies on SWIG to implement those, including all nested classes which where previously not included in the wrapper.\n\nThis means that some classes are now moved to be a subclass, meaning you might need to fix your imports. It would be possible to fall back to the previous behavior (`flatnested`), but that might cause naming conflicts and I think it's also cleaner this way.\n\nThere seems to be a problem though with directors (callback classes) where the method contains a nested class as an argument. It looks like a jni method signature problem (in `jenv->GetStaticMethodID`), I haven't found a solution for this and therefor \"flattened\" some director classes of btCollisionWorld (see `jni/swig/collision/btCollisionWorld.i` for details). In practice this means that you don't have to fix the import of these classes.\n\nSomeone decided that it would be a good idea to extend stl exceptions in swig. I don't think its worth it to workaround that (would get messy), instead we might as well deal with it and enable stl in the android build. For now, I simply modified `Application.mk`, but of-course that will overwritten when BulletBuild is run. It might be better to add e.g. an option to jnigen to enable stl. Note that actual required changes dont have to match my changes to application.mk (e.g. stl/gnu/static, stl might imply exceptions, etc). Compiling bullet for android takes ages, so I haven't compared each configuration.\n\nTested on windows and android.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1594","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1594/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1594/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1594/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1594","id":30476797,"number":1594,"title":"OrthogonalTiledMapRenderer render ordering is inverted","user":{"login":"JacobShipley","id":1435884,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1435884?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobShipley","html_url":"https://github.com/JacobShipley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobShipley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobShipley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobShipley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobShipley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobShipley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobShipley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobShipley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobShipley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobShipley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336980,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2014-03-30T22:47:38Z","updated_at":"2014-05-04T21:47:29Z","closed_at":"2014-05-04T21:47:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Default rendering order of tiles:\n\n![screenshot from 2014-03-30 17 37 35](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1435884/2562705/2f043f8e-b85c-11e3-8ef2-a647a530464f.png)\n\nIntended rendering order of tiles:\n\n![screenshot from 2014-03-30 17 37 03](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1435884/2562708/49474c88-b85c-11e3-99ae-385ff072760c.png)\n\nSimple solution:  Simply invert the rendering order in OrthogonalTiledMapRenderer.java:\n\n```\n#73 float y = row1 * layerTileHeight;\n#77 for (int row = row1; row < row2; row++) {\n#195 y += layerTileHeight; \n```\n\nbecomes:\n\n```\n #73 float y = row2 * layerTileHeight;\n #77 for (int row = row2; row >= row1; row--) {\n #195 y -= layerTileHeight;\n```\n\nThought I'd submit this as an issue rather than a pull request as I've no idea of the consequences of my \"solution\" on different tilemaps.

First of all there are missing all java docs if i noticed that right but thats just fine if you look into the examples. Second i'd love to have a return value for the setter of the ParticleEmitter to chain those setting. Instead of:\n\n``` java\n        emitter.getDuration().setLow(3000);\n\n        emitter.getEmission().setHigh(250);\n\n        emitter.getLife().setHigh(500, 1000);\n        emitter.getLife().setTimeline(new float[] { 0, 0.66f, 1 });\n        emitter.getLife().setScaling(new float[] { 1, 1, 0.3f });\n//and so on for one effect\n```\n\nid really love to see something like this\n\n``` java\nemitter.setDurationLow(3000).setEmissionHigh(250).setLifeHigh(500,1000); //and so on\n```\n\nI currently wrote a wrapperclass for this but i think it wont be much work to add the wrapper and the `return this;`. It would increase the useability of the ParticleSystem in case someone creates the Effects on runtime instead of creating them before starting the application with the `ParticleEditor`.\n\nWhile this adding the java docs would be a good job thing i think.\n\nOne more thing i just noticed if i render effects the `spritebatch.maxSpritesInBatch` rush to a really high level even if i init the `ParticleEffect` with an `TextureAtlas`. Am i doing something wrong or doesen't it work correct with the `TextureRegion` of the `ParticleEffect`?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1579/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1578","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1578/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1578/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1578/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1578","id":30435651,"number":1578,"title":"Add
