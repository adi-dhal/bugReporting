Instead, an exception is thrown saying no Drawable, NinePatch, TextureRegion, Texture or Sprite with the name \"name\" was found.\n\nLooking at the code, the author apparently expected `getRegion(String)` to return a `TextureRegion` or subclass of it in `getDrawable(String)`:\n\n```\nTextureRegion textureRegion = getRegion(name);\nif (textureRegion instanceof AtlasRegion) { ... }\n```\n\n`getRegion` only returns a `TextureRegion` though because it uses `optional(String, Class<?>)` which uses the given Class parameter to get the object from `resources` which is an `ObjectMap` that uses Classes as keys.\n\nEither `getRegion(String)` should traverse the `resources` map to check for subclasses (sounds slow to me) or `getDrawable(String)` should expect this behavior and explicitly search for an `AtlasRegion`. Currently, the if statement `textureRegion instanceof AtlasRegion` in line [270](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/scenes/scene2d/ui/Skin.java#L270) is never true. Note this also happens in [`getSprite(String)`](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/scenes/scene2d/ui/Skin.java#L245) and [`getPatch(String)`](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/scenes/scene2d/ui/Skin.java#L220).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1957/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1956","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1956/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1956/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1956/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1956","id":35395368,"number":1956,"title":"reading

! We just released our libgdx game on android platform. Currently, we are focusing on publishing our game built with the latest version of libgdx and robovm to apple store. But we are trapped with one big problem which impeded our release : \n\nOur game is level-based using tiled and the tmx format. When we run our game in a level with larger tiled map, there are alway some non/constant lag. To the levels with smaller tiled map, it is ok. The lag seems to be with regular interval (around 2-3 seconds) and it lasts only for around 300ms. Is this libgdx related or Robovm related?\n\nWe run Libgdx version 1.1.0 and robovm 0.0.14, the game runs well on Android and Desktop.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1952","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1952/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1952/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1952/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1952","id":35353733,"number":1952,"title":"Music interface getPosition() gives seconds or milliseconds based on backend.","user":{"login":"purelogiq","id":7828780,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7828780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/purelogiq","html_url":"https://github.com/purelogiq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purelogiq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purelogiq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purelogiq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purelogiq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purelogiq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purelogiq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purelogiq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purelogiq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purelogiq/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336980,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2014-06-10T06:15:00Z","updated_at":"2014-06-29T08:55:22Z","closed_at":"2014-06-29T08:55:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The documentation in com.badlogic.gdx.audio.Music for getPosition() reads\n<code>\n/*\\* Returns the playback position in milliseconds. */\n</code>\n\nThe desktop backend call with AL11.AL_SEC_OFFSET natively returns a value in <b>seconds</b>.\nThe android and gwt backends return values that are divided by 1000, giving <b>seconds</b>.\nThe iOS backend returns a value multiplied by 1000, giving <b>milliseconds</b> (I assume).\n\nPerhaps change the documentation and the iOS backend or change the desktop, android, and gwt backends.\n\n(On another note, issue #921 still is around, this issue especially breaks games that need to sync time to the music, like Stepmania. Calls to Music.getPosition() on the desktop backend return values that increase too quickly (maybe this depends on the hardware implementation?). You can test this by playing music and keeping elapsed time in the application's render method with Gdx.graphics.getDeltaTIme(). If you compare the elapsed time to what getPosition() returns you will see that getPosition() increases at a faster rate that the elapsed time. You can modify the MusicTest file in gdx-tests to set this up quickly but note that this does not happen with all songs, here is one that it does happen with (for me at least): https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx9k9I8v-JzvV19Gd0xBUk02TWs/edit?usp=sharing.\n\nI have no clue about openal but doing a quick google search many people say that AL11.AL_SEC_OFFSET rounds and that perhaps AL_SAMPLE_OFFSET divided by the sample rate will be a more accurate value?

It seems this is big problem to us at present.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1948","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1948/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1948/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1948/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1948","id":35268616,"number":1948,"title":"Make findActor method in Group return typed actor","user":{"login":"vlaaad","id":732554,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/732554?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlaaad","html_url":"https://github.com/vlaaad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlaaad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlaaad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlaaad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlaaad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlaaad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlaaad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlaaad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlaaad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlaaad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2014-06-09T08:36:14Z","updated_at":"2014-06-13T16:47:08Z","closed_at":"2014-06-09T09:28:21Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/1948","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1948","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1948.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1948.patch"},"body":"Since there are no names by default, if `findActor` returns something, it has known type to the user, because he is the one who assigns names.

The extension isn't linked into the libGDX build system so far. Also, this should probably be a branch? In any case, this is a draft for the pay API extension, so I am looking for feedback. \n\nFOR USERS:\nTo see how it works for a user of the payment API, have a look at \"PurchaseManager.java\" (Javadoc part explaining it all how to create a new payment service and make purchases).\n\nFOR CONTRIBUTORS/LIBGDX DEVELOPERS:\nlibGDX contributors (e.g. contributing the IAP for Google Play, iTunes, Amazon etc.) will need to implement the PurchaseManager.java and fill in the 2 functions in there. Have a look at my \"PurchaseManagerGoogleAndroid.java\" on what would be needed. It's still empty.\n\nAnyhow, the purchase API is pretty bare-bone. I think in the long-run we should add an Inventory.java on top of the libGDX Pay API which keeps track of purchases. I am flexible what naming concerns. It's possible that I got some things wrong. I believe there might be some people with a lot more experience so I'd be glad to address any concerns you guys have. Please note that I tried to simplify several things from my previous pull request (from last year). :-D

This \"bug\" was encountered by someone in the IRC channel and he said that he even had problems with API level 10, but I didn't look into that unfortunately. Since the change introducing this API 9 method was fixing something, we might not want to undo that. However in this case we should at least say that API level 8 is not supported.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1945/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1944","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1944/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1944/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1944/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1944","id":35215520,"number":1944,"title":"TiledMapRenderer
