Issue details\n\nVerticalGroup always aligns its elements to **center** independently of the alignment setting. Seems related to https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/commit/3840e4eea50482409972fc78a60e1deb69a59250.\n\nIn addition to adding wrapping, at least VerticalGroup behaviour is different than it was on earlier libGDX versions (with wrap set to false). I use VerticalGroup/HorizontalGroup as a lightweight containers for displaying elements in a column/row that auto-sizes with the inserted elements. Now setSize() seems to be required,  if this is intended behaviour it should probably be added to the CHANGES because it breaks existing UIs that make use of them.\n#### Reproduction steps/code\n\nSSCCE\nhttp://pastebin.com/JWiHkHwk\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\n\n1.9.4-SNAPSHOT\n#### Please select the affected platforms\n- [x] Android\n- [x] iOS (robovm)\n- [x] iOS (MOE)\n- [x] HTML/GWT\n- [x] Windows\n- [x] Linux\n- [x] MacOS\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4243/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4242","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4242/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4242/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4242/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4242","id":170505945,"number":4242,"title":"FacedCubemapData native heap leak","user":{"login":"lucasdupin","id":88702,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/88702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasdupin","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasdupin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasdupin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasdupin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasdupin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasdupin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasdupin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasdupin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasdupin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasdupin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasdupin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-08-10T20:04:29Z","updated_at":"2016-08-10T20:21:05Z","closed_at":"2016-08-10T20:20:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#### Issue details\n\nHi all,\nI've been playing with GDX for the past months and I noticed something.\nEvery time I create a `FacedCubemapData` it leaks memory on the **native heap**, since there is no `dispose` method to free all 6 `Pixmap`s.\n#### Reproduction steps/code\n\n[I created a sample project to help you reproduce the problem](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/files/412000/leaktest.zip). It will leak memory every time you tap the screen.\n\nThe problematic method is this one:\n\n``` java\n    public void leak () {\n        new FacedCubemapData(\n                Gdx.files.internal(\"face.png\"),\n                Gdx.files.internal(\"face.png\"),\n                Gdx.files.internal(\"face.png\"),\n                Gdx.files.internal(\"face.png\"),\n                Gdx.files.internal(\"face.png\"),\n                Gdx.files.internal(\"face.png\")\n        );\n    }\n```\n\nYes, it doesn't do anything useful but it's just a proof of concept =].  \nThe GC will remove our `FacedCubemapData`, keeping `Pixmap`s on the **native heap**. You can check the behavior by issuing the following command:\n\n```\nadb shell dumpsys meminfo in.lucasdup.leaktest\n```\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\n\ngdxVersion = '1.9.3'\n#### Please select the affected platforms\n- [X] Android\n- [ ] iOS (robovm)\n- [ ] iOS (MOE)\n- [ ] HTML/GWT\n- [ ] Windows\n- [ ] Linux\n- [ ] MacOS\n\nI've been testing this on Android but probably other platforms are also affected.\n\nPS: I can help with a fix / pull request\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4242/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4241","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4241/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4241/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4241/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4241","id":170499616,"number":4241,"title":"Controller API Lwjgl3 Not Detecting POV Movement (DPAD)","user":{"login":"fatalcubez","id":5571530,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5571530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatalcubez","html_url":"https://github.com/fatalcubez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatalcubez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatalcubez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatalcubez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatalcubez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatalcubez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatalcubez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatalcubez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatalcubez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatalcubez/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-08-10T19:33:23Z","updated_at":"2016-12-04T13:04:42Z","closed_at":"2016-12-04T13:04:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Right now I have my application setup to use the new lwjgl3 backend and the events for connecting and disconnecting a controller work (unlike before), but now the `povMoved` event never fires when I'm pressing on the DPAD. \n\nAlso, I know that some events are working because the event for `axisMoved` is being triggered when I move one of the analog sticks and `buttonDown` is being triggered when any of the buttons are being hit.\n\nAdditional Info:\n- Controller: Xbox One Controller\n- OS: Windows 8.1 x64\n- LWJGL 3 backend (and all associated Gradle dependencies needed for the Controllers extension)\n\nEDIT:\nAfter looking through the actual `Lwjgl3ControllerManager` class it looks like there is no event in place to handle the DPAD.

What does this PR do?\n\nThis PR adds a way to get the error code most free type functions return.\nThere is currently no way to get the error code since `if(error) return 0;` hides the error code.\nIt's possible to know _that_ an error occurred  but not _what_ error exactly occurred.\n\nWe could create a wrapper class which contains an error code (if there is one) and the result of the function, but this would be too inefficient.\nThat's why I came up with this solution.\n\nWhen a function returns `0` you can now check the error code via `getLastErrorCode()`.\nAll functions that throw an exception now include the error code.\n\nThe PR would allow easier fixing of this

The Label font scaling implementation makes the assumption that the underlying BitmapFont scale is set to 1 so that if the Label fontScaleX and fontScaleY are set to 1, there's no need to set the scale on the underlying BitmapFont.\n\nThat assumption is wrong as there are use cases in which it is useful to set the BitmapFont common scale to a value different than 1 and the use the specific Label's fontScale to scale each text.\n\nInstead of comparing to 1, the implementation should compare the Label fontScaleX and fontScaleY with the BitmapFont scaleX and scaleY or, alternatively, keep a flag \"fontScaleChanged\" to be set to true if fontScale is modified and then use it to check if there's a need to change the BitmapFont's scale.\n\nI will provide a PR when I get the chance.

Even redid the exercise of page\n\n[https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Orthographic-camera](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Orthographic-camera)\n\nI made the inclusion of 2 more conditions within the handleInput method to rotate the screen with the rotateAround method and there were no problems with the rendering of Sprite.\n\nBut when the rotation occurs when using OrthogonalTiledMapRenderer or TiledMapRenderer rendering is weird depending on the point chosen for the rotateAround.\n\nI posted a video. I used as an example to play the SuperKoalio. I ran two examples choosing 2 different positions to rotate the camera. In the right window the rotation takes place and the floor disappears. In the left window its just perfectly.\n I had the same problem in my game as the right window.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v35rHSwZhLE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v35rHSwZhLE)\n#### Reproduction steps/code\n\n-To reproduce the error.
