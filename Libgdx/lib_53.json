discussed [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24003582/libgdx-drawing-to-a-framebuffer-does-not-work), it is not possible to dispose framebuffer and use the texture later since dispose method dispose the texture as well.\nIt's not possible to change the colorTexture neither which is a big limitation for some use-cases : \n- use the same FBO to render multiple textures.\n- texture swap for multipass shader algorithm.\n\nFBO and texture attached to it may not have the same lifecycle.\nFor now my \"ugly\" workaround is to extends FrameBuffer in that way : \n\n``` java\npublic class RenderToTexture extends FrameBuffer\n{\n  ...\n    public Texture swapColorTexture()\n    {\n        Texture result = colorTexture;\n        setupTexture();     \n\n        bind();\n        Gdx.gl20.glFramebufferTexture2D(GL20.GL_FRAMEBUFFER, GL20.GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0, GL20.GL_TEXTURE_2D,\n                colorTexture.getTextureObjectHandle(), 0);\n        unbind();\n\n        return result;\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\nBut it's not a perfect solution for many reasons : \n- This generate one texture more which is never used (just used to dispose it).\n- FrameBufferCubeMap needs to be extended in the same way.\n- this not cover all the use cases.\n\nI could make a pull request with modifications on GLFrameBuffer class but i want to discuss about the solution before.\n\nIMO, the color buffer may have to be controlled by user code.\nThe idea would be : \n- default behavior still unchanged, a color texture is always created, attached and disposed.\n- a new method to create and attach a new texture.\n- a new method to attach a texture created before.\n- a new method to detach the current texture (to not be automatically disposed when FBO is disposed).\n- when the \"manual mode\" is used, user code is responsible to dispose detached textures.\n\nWhat do you think ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3324/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3323","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3323/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3323/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3323/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3323","id":99031607,"number":3323,"title":"Button.setChecked

devs,\n\nFirst of all I apologize if I'm making a mistake posting it here.\nHowever, recently I've updated the libgdx (from 1.4.1 to 1.6.1) without changing my game code.\nI noticed that the bitmaps and the life bars started to flicker such as in:\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/watch/42w5tb3dnrw2skk/ScreenCapture_03-08-2015_15.52.18.wmv\n(PS.: After recording this video I noticed that it does not actually flicker when I'm recording the screen from my computer).\nTherefore, I used my cellphone to record it (bad quality - I hope you can notice it, it happens when they are displaced). It did not happen in version 1.4.1.\nhttps://drive.google.com/a/id.uff.br/file/d/0BxJH7y8eF0sjMGRPYUNxcE9QTU0/view?usp=sharing\n\nThe life bar is being drawn like that:\n    public boolean drawLifeBar(SpriteBatch batch){\n        if (this.getMaxHP() == 0) return false;\n        //vars\n        final byte lifebarWidth = 50, lifebarHeight = (byte) greenlifebar.getHeight(), paddinGdown = 18;\n        final byte lifebarwidth2;\n        //vars\n        batch.draw(blackdotlife, this.x + (tilesPixelSize - lifebarWidth)/2 - 1, this.getNamePosY() - 1 + paddinGdown, lifebarWidth + 2, lifebarHeight + 2);\n        lifebarwidth2 = (byte) ((lifebarWidth*this.getCurrentHP())/this.getMaxHP());\n        //red bar draw\n        if (lifebarwidth2 <= lifebarWidth/5) batch.draw(redlifebar, this.x + (tilesPixelSize - lifebarWidth)/2, this.getNamePosY() + paddinGdown, lifebarwidth2, lifebarHeight);\n        else batch.draw(greenlifebar, this.x + (tilesPixelSize - lifebarWidth)/2, this.getNamePosY() + paddinGdown, lifebarwidth2, lifebarHeight);\n        return true;\n    }\n\nI've already tried to cast the positions of the sprite to integers, but that did not stop the flickering.\nBesides, using linear interpolation also did not change anything.\n\nHere is an example of how it was in 1.4.1:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpmRXUH2qFU\n\nPS.: I'm running it in the same computer with same specs in both versions.\nIs this expected to happen?\nThank you so much.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3321/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3320","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3320/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3320/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3320/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3320","id":98361525,"number":3320,"title":"Gradle

basically, if you had a file tree like so:\n\n```\n/tmp\n    /foo\n        /test.txt\n    /bar\n```\n\nwhere foo and bar are both sub directories of tmp and you tried to move foo into bar using FileHandle.moveTo(), the resulting hierarchy would look like this:\n\n```\n/tmp\n    /bar\n        /test.txt\n```\n\nthe foo directory would just disappear.
