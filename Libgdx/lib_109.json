guyz,\n\nMy first libgdx game is almost finished. I'll release it on web, facebook and Android. But I've noticed an issue with the musics :\nwhen i play a music in loop, it doesn't loop properly.\n- On the web version (expecially on firefox) there is a gap of few milliseconds before the music restart at the beginning. Ok, i guess it's a problem of HTML5, sound player, bla bla and it's not totally perfect for the moment. Yeah ?\n- BUT the main problem is on Android : when the music ends and loops to the beginning, it's the opposite issue of the web issue ! the music don't play till the end of the file, so few milliseconds of music are missing. In other words, the loop comes to quickly\n\nSomebody has already dealed with this ? Is it an issue of Android or libgdx ? ...me ? (well i juste use three lines of code to loop the music)\n\nSorry for the approximate english (i'm french).\n\nThxxx
