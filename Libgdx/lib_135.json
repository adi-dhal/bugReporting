support for setting a custom mouse cursor on the desktop. I added the setCursorImage method to the Input interface, since it seemed like the best place to put it - right underneath setCursorPosition.\n\nOnly LwjglInput has a non-empty implementation for now; I don't know if this is viable on any other platform - it's intended for desktop-only right now.\n\nThe method takes a Pixmap and hotspot params; a Pixmap works well for handling all of the byte juggling required by LWJGL's finicky Cursor class, since the final cursor image data must be an IntBuffer in ARGB8888 format, vertically flipped to allow for a lower-left origin, and only single-bit alpha transparency is supported (i.e., 0x00 or 0xFF).\n\nThe method works flawlessly on OSX 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard); it hasn't been tested on Windows or Linux. It works fine by loading the cursor image file via an AssetManager, and then passing the loaded Pixmap straight into the method. I'm sure there are other ways to load a Pixmap, but that's the only way I tested it with.\n\nPlease forgive the faux changes in IOSInput.java - there were nasty ^M characters floating around in there, and my git settings remove them automatically. I don't think they should be there anyway, so hope that's not a problem.

disposing the AssetManager, circular dependencies in our assets cause the reference counter of dependencies to decrease too quickly.\n\nThis is the code that causes problems with the circular dependency, as you can see, this will loop between assets that depend on each other and eventually crash:\n\n``` java\npublic synchronized void unload (String fileName) {\n\n    ...\n\n    // get the asset and its type\n    Class type = assetTypes.get(fileName);\n    if (type == null) throw new GdxRuntimeException(\"Asset not loaded: \" + fileName);\n\n    ...\n\n    // remove any dependencies (or just decrement their ref count).\n    Array<String> dependencies = assetDependencies.get(fileName);\n    if (dependencies != null) {\n        for (String dependency : dependencies) {\n            unload(dependency);\n        }\n    }\n\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nWe patched the problem by adding an if-statement before unloading the dependency:\n\n``` java\npublic synchronized void unload (String fileName) {\n\n    ...\n\n    // remove any dependencies (or just decrement their ref count).\n    Array<String> dependencies = assetDependencies.get(fileName);\n    if (dependencies != null) {\n

assets we need to fix, but it's a little more complicated than that. I'll try to explain:\n\nOur project uses lazy asset references to tackle object serialization problems: when an object (which is loaded in the AssetManager) contains references to other objects (also assets), instead of serializing the asset itself, we serialize a reference to that asset, which can, after all assets have been loaded in the AssetManager, retrieve and internally cache the assets from the AssetManager.\n\nThis means that our JsonLoader (an instance of AssetLoader) inspects the object (using the ClassReflection methods) in the getDependencies() stage to see if there are any assets which need to be loaded to make sure the AssetManager loads all of the assets internal asset references. These assets are therefore added as dependency of this object being deserialized. Therefore: when A has a reference to B and B to A, the loading code works fine, but the unloading code crashes. The only way to fix this seems to be stepping away from the automated dependency loading, which would be quite a pain for us.\n\nAre there any ideas/suggestions how we can tackle this problem?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/878","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/878/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/878/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/878/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/878","id":21702093,"number":878,"title":"Ability

sure if it's a bug, but seems like that with certain CJK fonts (at least with https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base/blob/master/data/fonts/MTLc3m.ttf?raw=true) there are issues in creating BitmapFont objects out of glyphs packed into a texture atlas.\n\nI've put some sample code at https://gist.github.com/agatti/7180052 to reproduce the issue with the font mentioned above.  When running that code, I should see the Japanese glyph す four times in different colours, using two font sizes (two Label objects, plus one raw TextureRegion drawn in a SpriteBatch, along with a call to BitmapFont.draw), however I only see the first CJK font and the TextureRegion drawn on screen (the label with the second CJK font and the BitmapFont.draw call won't show up).  I've debugged the issue a bit and seems like that the UV/U2V2 coordinates in the TextureRegion and what's being passed from BitmapCache differ, but I don't really see why this happens.\n\nThank you.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/876/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/875","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/875/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/875/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/875/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/875","id":21640361,"number":875,"title":"com.badlogic.gdx.maps.tiled.TmxMapLoader.loadObject() dont load width and height","user":{"login":"Gnumaru","id":5783414,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5783414?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gnumaru","html_url":"https://github.com/Gnumaru","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gnumaru/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gnumaru/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gnumaru/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gnumaru/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gnumaru/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gnumaru/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gnumaru/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gnumaru/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gnumaru/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2013-10-26T20:18:52Z","updated_at":"2013-10-26T23:37:24Z","closed_at":"2013-10-26T23:37:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"at lines 552 and 553 width and height are declared, but they are not put in the object's properties map.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/875/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/874","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/874/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/874/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/874/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/874","id":21637267,"number":874,"title":"Support Mac OS 10.9 Mavericks","user":{"login":"BSVogler","id":801818,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/801818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BSVogler","html_url":"https://github.com/BSVogler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BSVogler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BSVogler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BSVogler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BSVogler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BSVogler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BSVogler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BSVogler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BSVogler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BSVogler/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2013-10-26T17:06:10Z","updated_at":"2013-11-09T13:14:05Z","closed_at":"2013-11-09T12:20:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I get this message after upgrading:\n_java[3550] <Error>: The function `CGContextErase' is obsolete and will be removed in an upcoming update.

The class GLSurfaceViewCupcake is definitely responsible for the crash and the issue disappears after updating it to API 18 .\n\nRelevant changes done to android.opengl.GLSurfaceView from Android 4.3 (API 18) and/or taken from the last version of GLSurfaceViewCupcake:\n1. Added ResolutionStrategy to constructors.\n2. Overridden onMeasure method so to use the specified resolution strategy.\n3. Set format and type of the SurfaceHolder based on android sdk version.\n4. Commented Renderer and EGLConfigChooser interfaces since we have to use the ones from GLSurfaceView.\n5. In checkGLESVersion forced openGL ES version to a value lower than 2.0 because we can't use the hidden class SystemProperties.\n   If Libdgx already has its own method to detect the openGL version supported by the device we might use it here.\n\nFurther notes:\nBy looking at the code I think that issues 704 and 715 are already fixed in API 18, not tested though. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/859/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/858","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/858/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/858/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/858/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/858","id":21437216,"number":858,"title":"perlinNoise() method for 2d terrain generation.","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-10-23T07:18:34Z","updated_at":"2013-10-23T18:00:13Z","closed_at":"2013-10-23T18:00:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It may be useful to add perlinNoise() method in the math library.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/858/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/857","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/857/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/857/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/857/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/857","id":21404673,"number":857,"title":"Pools.freeAll() should check for null objects","user":{"login":"apotapov","id":131698,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/131698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apotapov","html_url":"https://github.com/apotapov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apotapov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apotapov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apotapov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apotapov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apotapov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apotapov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apotapov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apotapov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apotapov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336980,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2013-10-22T18:36:52Z","updated_at":"2013-10-24T17:18:48Z","closed_at":"2013-10-24T17:18:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Pools.freeAll() method differs slightly from Pool.freeAll in that it doesn't check whether the array objects are null, thus resulting in a possible NPE. \n\nThe code in Pools is:\n\n``` java\nfor (int i = 0, n = objects.size;
