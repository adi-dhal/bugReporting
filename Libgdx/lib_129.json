I have posted this on the forums and talked to people on IRC but nobody can find a work around. Based on my testing I am concluding that when something is being rendered to a frame buffer it's alpha is always set to 0.  When the frame buffer is Formatted to RGB888 it renders fine as there is no alpha.  But when rendered to with RGBA8888, the entire FBO is 100% transparent.  Changing the glClearColor to (0,0,0,1) will show everything in the FBO expect a whole created by what was rendered to it.  I am pretty sure that the code rendering to the FBO is setting the alpha to 0 before it renders.  Another piece of evidence is that someone told me that using shaders will fix the problem.  I assume that works as you have control over the alpha yourself with shaders.\n\nI am not sure how to attach the code to his tracker but I have posted the code in a couple of places\n\nhttp://www.badlogicgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=11718\nhttps://code.google.com/p/libgdx/issues/detail?id=1705&can=1&sort=-id\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1051/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1050","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1050/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1050/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1050/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1050","id":23728170,"number":1050,"title":"ETC1 loading on android","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2013-12-04T16:42:12Z","updated_at":"2013-12-13T23:00:24Z","closed_at":"2013-12-13T23:00:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Texture created with **Mali Texture Compression Tool v4.1.0** from a png file (1024*1024)\n\nThen tried to open in an android app:\n\n``` java\n                FileHandle file = Gdx.files.internal(\"data/r_texture1024.pkm\");\n                ETC1.ETC1Data data = new ETC1.ETC1Data(file);\n                ETC1TextureData td = new ETC1TextureData(data, false);\n                texture = new Texture(td);\n                texture.bind();\n\n```\n\n12-04 17:35:21.425: E/AndroidRuntime(3950): com.badlogic.gdx.utils.GdxRuntimeException: Couldn't load pkm file 'data/r_texture1024.pkm'\n12-04 17:35:21.425: E/AndroidRuntime(3950):     at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.glutils.ETC1$ETC1Data.<init>(ETC1.java:77)\n12-04 17:35:21.425: E/AndroidRuntime(3950):     at com.test.libgdx.SnowFall.create(SnowFall.java:98)\n12-04 17:35:21.425: E/AndroidRuntime(3950):     at com.badlogic.gdx.backends.android.AndroidGraphicsLiveWallpaper.onSurfaceChanged(AndroidGraphicsLiveWallpaper.java:424)\n12-04 17:35:21.425: E/AndroidRuntime(3950):     at android.opengl.GLSurfaceView$GLThread.guardedRun(GLSurfaceView.java:1505)\n12-04 17:35:21.425: E/AndroidRuntime(3950):     at android.opengl.GLSurfaceView$GLThread.run(GLSurfaceView.java:1240)\n12-04 17:35:21.425: E/AndroidRuntime(3950): Caused by: java.io.IOException: unknown format (magic number 4b50)\n12-04 17:35:21.425: E/AndroidRuntime(3950):     at java.util.zip.GZIPInputStream.<init>(GZIPInputStream.java:101)\n12-04 17:35:21.425: E/AndroidRuntime(3950):     at java.util.zip.GZIPInputStream.<init>(GZIPInputStream.java:81)\n12-04 17:35:21.425: E/AndroidRuntime(3950):     at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.glutils.ETC1$ETC1Data.<init>(ETC1.java:67)\n12-04 17:35:21.425: E/AndroidRuntime(3950):     ... 4 more\n\nHow can I load an ETC1 file normally?
