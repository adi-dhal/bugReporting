When 1.2.0 came along, it was integrated more directly in 1.1.0. However, this changed the function of Value.percentWidth (and percentHeight). I believe this change was accidental, but either way, it was not documented.\n\nThe EsotericSoftware version of Value.percentWidth lists the following description:\nhttps://github.com/EsotericSoftware/tablelayout/blob/master/tablelayout/src/com/esotericsoftware/tablelayout/Value.java#L170\n/*\\* Returns a value that is a percentage of the table's width. */\nTherefore, if you did something like, table.add(actor).width(Value.percentWidth(0.1f)); you could expect the widget to take up 10% of the table's width.\n\nHowever, in the new version, Value.percentWidth does the following:\nhttps://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/scenes/scene2d/ui/Value.java#L95\n/*\\* Returns a value that is a percentage of the actor's width. */\nMeaning that it returns a percentage of the actor specified in get(Actor actor)'s width.\nThis is perfectly fine, however, Table.java does not correctly use this modified Value.\n\nThis is evident here: https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/scenes/scene2d/ui/Table.java#L802\n\nValue.get(...) should be called with a reference to the table (like Value.get(table) ) in order to preserve the previous behavior. However, Table does Value.get(a), where a is the actor in the cell. This makes no sense whatsoever. \n\nBasically, the issue here is that Table is incorrectly using Value, and it defeats the purpose of using Value.percentWidth(...).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2016/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2015","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2015/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2015/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2015/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2015","id":36248543,"number":2015,"title":"Add VertexAttribute#type, #normalized, #hashCode(), .ColorPacked()","user":{"login":"xoppa","id":2349087,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2349087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa","html_url":"https://github.com/xoppa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2014-06-22T18:01:22Z","updated_at":"2014-09-14T19:51:59Z","closed_at":"2014-06-25T14:06:09Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/2015","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2015","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2015.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2015.patch"},"body":"Small change removing the branch on `Usage.ColorPacked` when binding the vertex attribute.
