ago, [in a galaxy far away](http://www.badlogicgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=8268), @badlogic brought up the idea of moving Box2D out of the libgdx core. This pull request removes Box2D to an extension so people who want/need it can add it.\n\nNotes:\n- I attempted to create the necessary maven information, but since I am not incredibly familiar with how this works, I may not have done it properly. Someone should check it.\n- I made a library descriptor for the extension so it can be included in the Setup-UI, however it will show as a \"Third Party\" Library due to the Setup-UI not having an \"Extensions\" section. Is this acceptable, or do we want to try to modify the Setup-UI to have an \"Extensions\" section (and include box2d, bullet, and freetype as options).\n- I moved the ParticleEmitterBox2D into the physics package, to ease the GWT side of things.\n- I was only able to test on Windows 64-bit, Android and GWT\n\nObviously, we'd need to make sure the change was well-known.
