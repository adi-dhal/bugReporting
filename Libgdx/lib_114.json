Every viewport now manages a camera. Mostly this was done to keep backwards compatibility and not break any API. I only had to add one more method to Stage which just sets the viewport parameters.\n\nI like how it works now, the only thing I don't like is the automatic position change of the camera when Viewport.update() is called. This might be removed and be done manually instead, keeping it more clean in total (Viewport wouldn't do anything but implement a scaling strategy in this case), but it also means it's less comfortable to use.\n\nHaving that said, all changes are completely additionally.

However I further need a stream of images as pixmap for scaling and drawing which is already available in the Pixmap packer and can be accessed using \"getPixmap\" function from \"Page\".

This will modify Vector3.Y, which is probably undesired. Understandable mistake, given the lack of javadocs (see #1488). Since the goal of the user was probably to get the angle _around_ the axis, I took the extra effort to implement those methods as well. As well as fetching euler angles and added some static methods which might help to remove the temp usage. Also added some javadocs along the way.\n\nNote that I did test the methods and they seem to function correctly (within the range mathematical expected). But especially the euler angles were a bit confusing (its all a matter of order). Therefor I guess it doesn't harm if someone can double
