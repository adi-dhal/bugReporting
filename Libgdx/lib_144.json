However, in the constructor of Mesh, it calls the createBuffers( ) function , which must happen on the GL thread. But I see no reason why this cannot happen lazily right before drawing (since it does get called by checkManagedAndDirty() anyways. I made a simple modification so that it does this.\n\n_Original issue: http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/issues/detail?id=25_\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/612","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/612/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/612/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/612/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/612","id":19509371,"number":612,"title":"Redundant code in Mesh?","user":{"login":"badlogic","id":514052,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/514052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic","html_url":"https://github.com/badlogic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336982,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2013-09-14T20:00:26Z","updated_at":"2013-09-14T20:00:29Z","closed_at":"2013-09-14T20:00:29Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"_From [karthikt...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/118033818539569850455/) on July 13, 2010 18:32:23_\n\nin Mesh.java line \n\npublic void render( int primitiveType )\n        {\n                if( graphics.isGL20Available() )\n                        throw new IllegalStateException( \"can't use this render method with OpenGL ES 2.0\" );\n\n```\n            checkManagedAndDirty();\n            render( primitiveType, 0, maxIndices > 0? getNumIndices(): getNumVertices() );\n    }\n```\n\nsimply calls the  public void render( int primitiveType, int offset, int count ) on line 451 which does the whole GL20 and checkManagedAndDirty() routine again when it only needs to be checked once in the second function.\n\n_Original issue: http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/issues/detail?id=24_\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/611","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/611/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/611/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/611/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/611","id":19509369,"number":611,"title":"Prismatic joint bug","user":{"login":"badlogic","id":514052,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/514052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic","html_url":"https://github.com/badlogic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336980,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2013-09-14T20:00:21Z","updated_at":"2013-09-14T20:00:25Z","closed_at":"2013-09-14T20:00:25Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"_From [cpasju...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/107955730618067784412/) on June 28, 2010 20:57:33_\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem? 1.

Touch events can hammer your framerate. In some cases maybe its not noticable, in others its very noticable. I solved this before I rewrote my game to solely use the facilities of libgdx, now coming back to it...\n\nreference this thread for a discussion about it, http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/39eea4d7f6e6dfca The solution is simple enough but I dont think theres a one-size-fits-all here. For me, in AndroidInput.onTouch for MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE I added an eventQueue.wait(40L); which seems to suit my own game just fine. The default behaviour makes my game rather unplayable due to its fast nature.\n\nMaybe worth some consideration; providing a mechanism to throttle Listener events\n\n_Original issue: http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/issues/detail?id=19_\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/606","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/606/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/606/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/606/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/606","id":19509361,"number":606,"title":"Contact.getFixtureA() and ...B() generate Long type allocations","user":{"login":"badlogic","id":514052,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/514052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic","html_url":"https://github.com/badlogic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336982,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2013-09-14T19:59:57Z","updated_at":"2013-09-14T20:00:05Z","closed_at":"2013-09-14T20:00:05Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"_From [dasac...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/105164384981209237729/) on June 18, 2010 03:18:48_\n\ncontinual calls to Contact.getFixtureA() and ...B() continually creates Long type allocations which I guess would make the GC kick in here and there eventually.\n\nDont know if anything can even be done about it, but thought it worth a mention.\n\n_Original issue: http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/issues/detail?id=18_\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/606/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/605","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/605/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/605/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/605/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/605","id":19509357,"number":605,"title":"Stop using ArrayList in VertexAttributes","user":{"login":"badlogic","id":514052,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/514052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic","html_url":"https://github.com/badlogic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336980,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2013-09-14T19:59:51Z","updated_at":"2013-09-14T19:59:55Z","closed_at":"2013-09-14T19:59:55Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"_From [dasac...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/105164384981209237729/) on June 18, 2010 01:35:46_\n\nI've been doing some profiling with DDMS and trying to kill bottlenecks of my code.

A call to VertexAttributes.get(i) in Mesh.render is actually the most time consuming process according to my profile eating up 25&#37; of Mesh.render's processing time.\n\nWould it benefit the speed of Mesh.render to have VertexAttributes stop using ArrayList's?\n\nLine 47 of VertexAttributes reads\nArrayList<VertexAttribute> list = new ArrayList<VertexAttribute>();\n\nBut all the information to do this is already there\nVertexAttribute list[] = new VertexAttribute[attributes.length];\n\nand change everything else accordingly.\n\nSorry if this is a stupid recommendation, like I said before I am a complete noob to java performance and am only going by my profiling benchmarks from DDMS.\n\n_Original issue: http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/issues/detail?id=17_\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/605/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/604","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/604/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/604/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/604/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/604","id":19509354,"number":604,"title":"Box2D collision, broken","user":{"login":"badlogic","id":514052,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/514052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic","html_url":"https://github.com/badlogic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336980,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true},{"id":11336985,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/wontfix","name":"wontfix","color":"ffffff","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2013-09-14T19:59:47Z","updated_at":"2013-09-14T19:59:50Z","closed_at":"2013-09-14T19:59:50Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"_From [rtaylor205@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/rtaylor205@gmail.com/) on June 17, 2010 19:37:14_\n\nCollision is not working, objects simply overlap.\n\nThe changes in contactFilter always returns false.\n\nAttached is a hack that makes it work, but I don't know whether this is the correct way.

OriginX and OriginY are currently set in the draw method of SpriteBatch . I get mostly unexpected results as what I pass in is dependent on other factors like scale. I have yet to get a rotation on the origin point to work correctly (my own shortcoming im sure).\n\nAnother library I used for opengl was pyglet, and when creating a Texture, you would set the origin point on the texture object. This was via an anchor_x and anchor_y which maybe is not the same concept as origin?. But in this case, it would make sense to be able to set an origin/anchor on the Texture object and this would be referenced for calculations like rotation.\n\nThe benefit to this is one calculates the origin of the texture simply based on its pixel size, so if i have a 32x32 texture and i set the origin to (16, 16) then its pretty obvious what should happen when applying various transformations during draw.\n\n_Original issue: http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/issues/detail?id=10_\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/601/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/600","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/600/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/600/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/600/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/600","id":19509345,"number":600,"title":"Change SpriteBatch.draw arguments from int to float","user":{"login":"badlogic","id":514052,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/514052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic","html_url":"https://github.com/badlogic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336980,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2013-09-14T19:59:29Z","updated_at":"2013-09-14T19:59:33Z","closed_at":"2013-09-14T19:59:33Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"_From [dasac...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/105164384981209237729/) on June 17, 2010 05:04:54_\n\nThis is a feature request. I'm not experienced with java so I dont know if there are any implications to this.\n\nCurrently the arguments: x, y, originX, originY are accepted as int. Their immediate use inside of SpriteBatch .draw have them become float. If working in a space smaller then the actual pixel size of the screen, one might want to pass float values instead. Even if working solely with int, it seems java is not partial to an argument being cast as (int) when it requires (float) so it seems like a win-win\n\n_Original issue: http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/issues/detail?id=9_\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/599","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/599/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/599/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/599/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/599","id":19509342,"number":599,"title":"Include Build Instructions","user":{"login":"badlogic","id":514052,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/514052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic","html_url":"https://github.com/badlogic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336982,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2013-09-14T19:59:23Z","updated_at":"2013-09-14T19:59:27Z","closed_at":"2013-09-14T19:59:27Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"_From [dasac...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/105164384981209237729/) on June 09, 2010 17:41:44_\n\nIs it possible to include build instructions for gdx for losers like me who haven't a clue?\n\n_Original issue: http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/issues/detail?id=8_\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/599/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/598","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/598/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/598/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/598/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/598","id":19509340,"number":598,"title":"ContactListener Contact arg contains same Fixture for getFixtureA and getFixtureB","user":{"login":"badlogic","id":514052,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/514052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic","html_url":"https://github.com/badlogic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336980,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2013-09-14T19:59:17Z","updated_at":"2013-09-14T19:59:21Z","closed_at":"2013-09-14T19:59:21Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"_From [dasac...@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/105164384981209237729/) on June 09, 2010 05:16:01_\n\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem? 1.

Contact information can be found in the docs link above.\n\nThanks for your time,\n\n~ Erlend Sogge Heggen\n\n_Original issue: http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/issues/detail?id=2_\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/593/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/592","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/592/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/592/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/592/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/592","id":19509321,"number":592,"title":"Samsung Galaxy 1.5 - Black screen instead hello world app","user":{"login":"badlogic","id":514052,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/514052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic","html_url":"https://github.com/badlogic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336980,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true},{"id":11336985,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/wontfix","name":"wontfix","color":"ffffff","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2013-09-14T19:58:10Z","updated_at":"2013-09-14T19:58:26Z","closed_at":"2013-09-14T19:58:26Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"_From [Mariusz....@gmail.com](https://code.google.com/u/103927374618490518049/) on April 19, 2010 13:35:53_\n\nHello,\n\ni'm using Samsung Galaxy with standard Android 1.5 and when i'm running the \nhello world (without any modifications) app i see only black screen instead \nof the graphic and text.
