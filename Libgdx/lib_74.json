using on top scroll bar for a scroll pane with a content widget smaller than the display area, the layout seems incorrect to me since the content widget won't get extended to the complete scrollpane area (this is a followup to PR #2709).\n\nIf we take, the [ScrollPaneScrollBarsTest](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/tests/gdx-tests/src/com/badlogic/gdx/tests/ScrollPaneScrollBarsTest.java) test and just change the displayed text by a rect (to clearly see the bounds) with this simple modification ;\n\n``` java\n// vertOnlyLeftTable.add(new Label(\"VERT-ONLY-LEFT\", skin));\n// vertOnlyRightTable.add(new Label(\"VERT-ONLY-RIGHT\", skin));\nvertOnlyLeftTable.add(new Image(skin.getDrawable(\"default-rect\"))).height(20).expandX().fill();\nvertOnlyRightTable.add(new Image(skin.getDrawable(\"default-rect\"))).height(20).expandX().fill();\n```\n\nYou get the following result :\n![2015-01-05 17_34_34-scrollpanescrollbarstest](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2796036/5616073/47926256-9501-11e4-8b8a-978516219378.png)\n\nand when scrolling:\n![2015-01-05 17_35_14-scrollpanescrollbarstest](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2796036/5616076/50114384-9501-11e4-9cce-99d35a1ee9d8.png)\n\nI would think that the correct behavior would be to have the content widget expands to the complete scrollpane area.\n\nLooking at the code, this seems to be due to the fact that the size of the widget is set after adjusting the display area of the content pane:\n\n``` java\n        if (fade) {\n            // Make sure widget is drawn under fading scrollbars.\n            if (scrollX) areaHeight -= scrollbarHeight;\n            if (scrollY) areaWidth -= scrollbarWidth;\n        } else {\n            if (scrollbarsOnTop) {\n                // Make sure widget is drawn under non-fading scrollbars.\n                if (scrollX) widgetAreaBounds.height += scrollbarHeight;\n                if (scrollY) widgetAreaBounds.width += scrollbarWidth;\n            } else {\n                // Offset widget area y for horizontal scrollbar at bottom.\n                if (scrollX && hScrollOnBottom) widgetAreaBounds.y += scrollbarHeight;\n                // Offset widget area x for vertical scrollbar at left.\n                if (scrollY && !vScrollOnRight) widgetAreaBounds.x += scrollbarWidth;\n            }\n        }\n\n        // If the widget is smaller than the available space, make it take up the available space.\n        widgetWidth = disableX ? areaWidth : Math.max(areaWidth, widgetWidth);\n        widgetHeight = disableY ? areaHeight : Math.max(areaHeight, widgetHeight);\n```\n\nA way to make it better would be to extend the size of the content widget when scrollbars are on top before adjusting the size of the display area (if you agree, I will prepare a proper PR):\n\n``` java\n        if (scrollbarsOnTop) {\n            // If the widget is smaller than the available space, make it take up the available space.\n            widgetWidth = disableX ? areaWidth : Math.max(areaWidth, widgetWidth);\n            widgetHeight = disableY ? areaHeight : Math.max(areaHeight, widgetHeight);\n\n            if (fade) {\n                // Make sure widget is drawn under fading scrollbars.\n                if (scrollX) areaHeight -= scrollbarHeight;\n                if (scrollY) areaWidth -= scrollbarWidth;\n            } else {\n                // Make sure widget is drawn under non-fading scrollbars.\n                if (scrollX) widgetAreaBounds.height += scrollbarHeight;\n                if (scrollY) widgetAreaBounds.width += scrollbarWidth;\n            }\n        } else {\n            if (fade) {\n                // Make sure widget is drawn under fading scrollbars.\n                if (scrollX) areaHeight -= scrollbarHeight;\n                if (scrollY) areaWidth -= scrollbarWidth;\n            } \n            // Offset widget area y for horizontal scrollbar at bottom.\n            if (scrollX && hScrollOnBottom) widgetAreaBounds.y += scrollbarHeight;\n            // Offset widget area x for vertical scrollbar at left.\n            if (scrollY && !vScrollOnRight) widgetAreaBounds.x += scrollbarWidth;\n\n            // If the widget is smaller than the available space, make it take up the available space.\n            widgetWidth = disableX ? areaWidth : Math.max(areaWidth, widgetWidth);\n            widgetHeight = disableY ? areaHeight : Math.max(areaHeight, widgetHeight);\n        }\n```\n\nUsing this little modification, I made the following test situations ;\n- content smaller/bigger than scrollpane, ontop = true, fade = true, => Ok\n- content smaller/bigger than scrollpane, ontop = true, fade = false, => Ok\n- content smaller/bigger than scrollpane, ontop = false, fade = false, => Ok\n- content smaller/bigger than scrollpane, ontop = false, fade = true, => somewhat wrong (view area clipped where the scrollbar would be) => but is there any use case for this ?\n\nWhat do you think ?\n\nNB : On a side note, I think there is a tiny little bug in [ScrollPaneScrollBarsTest](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/tests/gdx-tests/src/com/badlogic/gdx/tests/ScrollPaneScrollBarsTest.java), the initial state of scrollpane flags are not set. You need to add this at the end of the constructor to get correct result (I will do a proper PR when discussion is ok):\n\n``` java\n        for (ScrollPane pane : scrollPanes) {\n            pane.setFadeScrollBars(doFade);\n            pane.setScrollbarsOnTop(doOnTop);\n        }\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2712","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2712/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2712/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2712/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2712","id":53397852,"number":2712,"title":"Merge

Even though they are trivial problems beginner coders may not understand how to get past them.\n\nThanks,\nMitchell\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2703/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2702","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2702/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2702/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2702/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2702","id":53298698,"number":2702,"title":"\"Windowed\" window becomes unresizable after changing dimensions programatically","user":{"login":"Zalewa","id":563785,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/563785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zalewa","html_url":"https://github.com/Zalewa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zalewa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zalewa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zalewa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zalewa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zalewa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zalewa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zalewa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zalewa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zalewa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-01-03T08:49:24Z","updated_at":"2015-01-17T16:41:27Z","closed_at":"2015-01-17T16:41:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I've run into a problem where the game window becomes unresizable when the window is in \"windowed\" mode and I change resolution of this window through Gdx.graphics.setDisplayMode() but keep it in \"windowed\" mode.\n\nHere's a video showing what's going on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPSJdaKNimY\n\nIt doesn't matter where I place the call to resize to 845, 454.

That is pretty annoying and counterintuitive. Anyways, things get worse. Beyond having to manually flip each created Sprite on the y-axis I have to reflip it after calling the .setRegion(int, int, int, int) function of the Sprite class. Not to mention the confusions implied.\n\nTherefore, I suggest two things:\n1) To create a method within the OrtographicCamera class to return whether the camera is flipped or not. This could be used on the following code:\n2) The Sprite class could be extended just the way I did below, this will prevent the user from having to flip the sprites everytime they are created (if the \"true\" on the constructor is substitued by the boolean returned by (1)) and when the method setRegion is called.\n\npackage generalsystem;\n\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.Texture;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g2d.TextureRegion;\n\npublic class Sprite extends com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g2d.Sprite {\n    private boolean flippedY = false, flippedX = false;\n\n```\n/** Creates an uninitialized sprite.
