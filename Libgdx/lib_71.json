However, after spending about an hour using the tool and Googling around, I've discovered this to be far from simple. \n\n(For example, see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13996547/how-do-i-bundle-a-jre-into-an-exe-for-a-java-application-launch4j-says-runtime]), [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15412530/how-do-i-use-the-bundle-jre-option-in-launch4j), and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6871987/distribute-my-application-jar-with-a-jre)).\n\nThe Launch4j tool lets you specify a relative \"Bundled JRE Path\", which sounds like a relative path within the jar file to the JRE. For example, within my jar I have included a folder \"jre\" which contains a complete JRE (v1.8.0_31). However, specifying \"jre\" as the path only tells Launch4j to look in the folder _outside_ the jar, instead of looking within the jar as you would expect from the word \"bundled\". Copious stackoverflow posts confirm that this is an issue, and that others have combined Launch4j along with another install wrapper so they can include the JRE folder adjacent their jar file after the install. This way, Launch4j can find the JRE. \n\nIn short, this is neither desirable nor expected behavior: I want to include the entire JRE within my JAR, and point Launch4j into the jar file.\n\n**TL;DR** **Please provide a brief tutorial or a few pointers describing how to bundle a JRE within a JAR and point Launch4j to that JRE.**\n\nTo confirm that you are actually using the desired JRE (not the system JRE and not the JRE in a local folder, but the actual JRE bundled within the jar), you should be able to view properties of the javaw process from Task Manager and see the path of the process is in some temporary extracted location, not in \"Program Files.....\".\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2798","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2798/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2798/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2798/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2798","id":56177825,"number":2798,"title":"ShaderProgram class is NOT throwing exceptions in case it is not called in between a .begin() and a .end()","user":{"login":"edesdan","id":5745049,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5745049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edesdan","html_url":"https://github.com/edesdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edesdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edesdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edesdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edesdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edesdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edesdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edesdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edesdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edesdan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2015-02-01T20:55:34Z","updated_at":"2015-02-02T16:12:00Z","closed_at":"2015-02-02T16:10:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi All,\nI recently had a lot of trouble using some features of ShaderProgram class.\nAccording to the javadoc: \n\n``` java\n/** Sets the uniform with the given name.

Basically, each actors would have an index, and to press \"down\" or \"up\" would just make the selection going through the index table. (libGDX would set up a default button/axis for up/down, select, cancel, but the user would be free to change it)\n\n3) A last question, the mapping for the OUYA is integrated out-of-the-box in libGDX. The mapping for the Xbox360 is out there: \nhttp://www.gamefromscratch.com/post/2014/09/22/LibGDX-Tutorial-Part-14-Gamepad-support.aspx\nBut it is not integrated out-of-the-box in libGDX.

Should we bother with making `Matrix4` faster? Should I bother with crafting a PR for this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2783/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2782","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2782/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2782/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2782/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2782","id":55916914,"number":2782,"title":"GWT sources seem to have outdated field \"suffix\" in com.badlogic.gdx.assets.loaders.resolvers.ResolutionFileResolver.Resolution","user":{"login":"levz","id":10760011,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10760011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/levz","html_url":"https://github.com/levz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/levz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/levz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/levz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/levz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/levz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/levz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/levz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/levz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/levz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-01-29T15:55:30Z","updated_at":"2015-01-29T16:14:58Z","closed_at":"2015-01-29T16:14:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I was trying to build gwt project when it failed with \n\n [ERROR] Errors in 'file:/F:/GameDev/SokobanGame/devcode/core/src/com/happycroc/skbn/ResolutionResolver.java'\n      [ERROR] Line 103: folder cannot be resolved or is not a field\n      [ERROR] Line 107: folder cannot be resolved or is not a field\n      [ERROR] Line 111: folder cannot be resolved or is not a field\n\nIt looks like com.badlogic.gdx.assets.loaders.resolvers.ResolutionFileResolver.Resolution in gdx-backend-gwt-1.5.3.jar still hass field name \"suffix\" while in gdx-1.5.3.jar  this field is called \"folder\".\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2781","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2781/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2781/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2781/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2781","id":55908086,"number":2781,"title":"Add javadoc to Bullet wrapper","user":{"login":"Matsemann","id":1030544,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1030544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matsemann","html_url":"https://github.com/Matsemann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matsemann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matsemann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matsemann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matsemann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matsemann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matsemann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matsemann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matsemann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Matsemann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-01-29T14:51:00Z","updated_at":"2015-01-29T18:37:36Z","closed_at":"2015-01-29T18:16:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for a great wrapper.

In my game (15x10) tiles on the screen, sized (64x64 px) with culling (default implementation) rendering tiled map takes 15% of whole game where's a lot of box2d, actors, animations etc. I have only 3 tile layers but for sure I'm gonna need 2 more. With 9 layers it's more than 1/4 of total game. The worst thing is that it's even not rendered because most of them are mainly empty for testing purposes.\n\nI had a feeling that it can be upgraded and it seems that this is the bottleneck:\n    <code>\npublic Cell getCell (int x, int y) {\n        if (x < 0 || x >= width) return null;\n        if (y < 0 || y >= height) return null;\n        return cells[x][y];\n    }\n</code>\nin TiledMapTileLayer. This method is being called for every tile visible on the screen for all 3 layers.so It gives 15x10x3=450 calls per frame in my case. The cell array is pretty big because the level is big. \n\nI think that making this array cells[y][x] should make a small improvement because most screens are wide and it's better to have 10 arrays of 15 elements than 15 arrays of 10 elements. Or it will be good to have an option to choose if our game is vertical or horizontal. \n\nAlso it is worth to consider if we read the array in the most efficent way (in the order how it's stored in memory) and if the cells are stored in the same order how we want to read them. This is more complicated case because it may be stored in different ways on different devices (iOS i.e) but in Java there are arrays of arrays where elements of one array are continous.\n\nFinally, reading from such big 2d array may be a problem itself. In my case there's a 500x40 tiled map. It's not a big deal but for 995 calls i got 1142 CPU time (DDMS) so it gives ~1ms per call. I use Motorola Moto G with quad core processor 1,2GHz so imagine how it can influence older devices. I think that some kind of partitioning may help if previous ones can't.\n\nWhat do you think guys about it?\n\nPS getCell is about 60% of whole tiledmap render(). About 30% is the method itself. I didn't measure times for every lines but there is a lot of other work implemented there so I don't think that there's any bottleneck. Worth to check though.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2778","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2778/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2778/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2778/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2778","id":55827670,"number":2778,"title":"Missing asin() function in StrictMath/Math for GWT","user":{"login":"JFixby","id":1580663,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1580663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFixby","html_url":"https://github.com/JFixby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFixby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFixby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFixby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFixby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFixby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFixby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFixby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFixby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFixby/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2015-01-28T22:46:34Z","updated_at":"2015-03-15T16:07:04Z","closed_at":"2015-02-01T13:33:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi\nI'm having this GWT-compilation error:\n [ERROR] Errors in 'file:/D:/red-triplane-fokker-gradle/core/fishing/com/jfixby/red/triplane/api/FloatMath.java'\n      [ERROR] Line 114: The method asin(double) is undefined for the type StrictMath\n\nSeems like the StrictMath emulation is missing asin function.\n\nCan you please add it?\n\nThank you.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2778/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2777","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2777/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2777/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2777/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2777","id":55792832,"number":2777,"title":"ScrollPane offsets widget by bar size","user":{"login":"dermetfan","id":4956158,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4956158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dermetfan","html_url":"https://github.com/dermetfan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dermetfan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dermetfan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dermetfan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dermetfan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dermetfan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dermetfan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dermetfan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dermetfan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dermetfan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336980,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true},{"id":172870364,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/need%20more%20info","name":"need more info","color":"bfdadc","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-01-28T18:08:27Z","updated_at":"2015-02-03T18:45:17Z","closed_at":"2015-02-03T18:45:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This bug was introduced in 1.5.3.
