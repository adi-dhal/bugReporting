commit 841f50b233da7da97f67e24893093d3e10400b87 metadata code was changed in the method `public FieldMetadata (Field field)` in gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/utils/Json.java. \n\nIn that commit, a special case was added for the types ObjectMap and HashMap, but the interface Map which is implemented by HashMap was left out. As a result, when deserializing a field of type Map, the value data was expected to be of the key type, and it could no longer be deserialized. We hotfixed this by temporarily changing the type of the field to HashMap. As far as I can see, this should be a trivial fix by adding the type Map to the ternary operation that special cases the Map types:\n\n``` java\nint index = (ClassReflection.isAssignableFrom(ObjectMap.class, field.getType()) || ClassReflection.isAssignableFrom(HashMap.class, field.getType()) || ClassReflection.isAssignableFrom(Map.class, field.getType()))

This script will find any source files (currently only .java, but configurable) that are missing the Apache header under the libgdx dir tree.  It then gives you the option to insert the header.  This PR is the result of running that script. I was able to do the ant build sucessfully after running the script.\n\nThings I don't know about:\n- Do all these files need the header?  I don't know about box2d, bullet, other third party stuff.\n- Does anyone really care about this?\n- What other source extensions does this need to work for?\n\nAll in all I think I just wanted to write some python.
