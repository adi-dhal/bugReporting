Now, I understand that libgdx is not thread-safe, but is this a reason to make it so much thread unfriendly?\n\nThe issue I'm experiencing here as been described a lot of time now, in #3388, #3369, #3172, etc...\nEverytime you close it because \"it's just a multithread problem\". But wouldn't it be worth looking into the code of GlyphLayout to reduce the occurrence of bugs like this?\n\nGlyphLayout use a `static private final Array<Color> colorStack` and then clears it like this:\n\n``` java\nfor (int i = 1, n = colorStack.size; i < n; i++)\n    colorPool.free(colorStack.get(i));\ncolorStack.clear();\n```\n\nThis seems the most _thread unfriendly_ way of doing that. I know libgdx is not thread safe, but given the number of people who have bugs like this, it could be really great to change this colorStack into maybe a member instead of a static or something like that.\n\nThanks\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3491/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3490","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3490/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3490/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3490/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3490","id":111481342,"number":3490,"title":"JNIGen compile but won't execute on x64","user":{"login":"omulmann","id":2735099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2735099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/omulmann","html_url":"https://github.com/omulmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omulmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omulmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omulmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omulmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omulmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omulmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omulmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omulmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omulmann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2015-10-14T20:04:11Z","updated_at":"2015-11-04T12:13:31Z","closed_at":"2015-11-04T12:13:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Build\n\n``` java\npackage bar;\npublic class Build{\n    public static void main (String[] args) throws Exception {\n        NativeCodeGenerator jnigen = new NativeCodeGenerator();\n        jnigen.generate(\"src\\\\test\\\\java\", \"test-classes\", \"jni\", new String[] {\"Foo.java\"}, null);\n        BuildTarget win64 = BuildTarget.newDefaultTarget(TargetOs.Windows, true);\n        new AntScriptGenerator().generate(new BuildConfig(\"foo\"), win64);\n        BuildExecutor.executeAnt(\"jni/build-windows64.xml\", \"-v -Dhas-compiler=true clean postcompile\");\n        BuildExecutor.executeAnt(\"jni/build.xml\", \"-v pack-natives\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNative\n\n``` java\npublic class Foo {\n    // @off\n    static public native int add (int a, int b); /*\n        return a + b;\n    */\n    public static void main (String[] args) throws Exception {\n        new JniGenSharedLibraryLoader(\"libs/foo-natives.jar\").load(\"foo64\");\n        System.out.println(add(1, 2));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAfter running build (successful - jar with foo64.dll bundled), executing Foo ... fails ...

is an API breaking change**\n- Removes the `mesh`, `meshPartOffset`, `meshPartSize` and `primitiveType` members of `Renderable` and adds the `meshPart` member instead. \n- Adds the `center`, `halfExtents` and `radius` members to `MeshPart`.\n- Rename `MeshPart#indexOffset` to `MeshPart#offset` and `MeshPart#numVertices` to `MeshPart#size`.\n\nThe bounds are (and should be) calculated as soon as possible and not more than needed. In case of `Model` this is when the model is loaded from file or created using `ModelBuilder`. Custom implementation that create `MeshPart` instances should be updated accordingly.\n\nCalculating the bounds of the entire `Model`/`ModelInstance` is not affected by these values. That is still a costly operation that takes into account the node transformation.\n\nThe naming (`indexOffset` and `numVertices`) always have been confusing and the actual meaning depends on whether the mesh is indexed or not. Since this is already API breaking change, I thought this would be a good moment to change those names as well. The `offset` is the offset in the mesh to the start of the part and `size` is the size of the part.\n\n_Custom shader changes:_\n`MeshPart` now contains a convenience method to easily render the part:\n\n``` java\nrenderable.meshPart.render(program);\n```\n\nFor more info about the reason for these changes, see also
