there,\n\nI'm wondering if you're able to now support html5 projects in IntelliJ? The gradle link for intellij talks about iOS and HTML5 not being supported, while the maven page:\n\nhttps://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Maven-integration\n\ntalks about creating run configurations for Desktop and Android, but not for HTML5.\n\nIs HTML5 support being worked on? Could we have a possible eta for it?\n\nThis is a very important feature for those who don't like Eclipse but would still like to use LibGDX.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1317/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1316","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1316/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1316/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1316/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1316","id":27341504,"number":1316,"title":"Parsing xml from jdom2 with newlines","user":{"login":"BennX","id":4281635,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4281635?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BennX","html_url":"https://github.com/BennX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BennX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BennX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BennX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BennX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BennX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BennX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BennX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BennX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BennX/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2014-02-11T11:48:01Z","updated_at":"2014-02-11T14:49:46Z","closed_at":"2014-02-11T13:42:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I do generate quest with an applikation with jdom2.
