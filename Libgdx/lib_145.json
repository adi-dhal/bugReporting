warning upfront: This changes the uniforms used by the DefaultShader, if someone has a custom implementation based on those it probably needs to be changed also. Previously the uniform u_projTrans was set to the Camera.combined matrix, this change sets it to Camera.projection and adds additional uniforms, like u_projViewTrans which is set to Camera.combined.\n\nhttps://github.com/xoppa/libgdx/commit/9f56fefef0da7512bcff3d5250e50dd390029b1d: add DepthShader and DepthShaderProvider. The implementation is very basic, the glsl files are on the class path (might require a GWT change). Only two options skinned/non-skinned, blending (based on e.g. diffuse texture) is not implemented yet.\n\n I'm not very happy with this solution, but its better than nothing I guess. Implementing a good depth/shadow shader (depth textures, cubemaps) requires a more fundamental change (mainly Texture and FrameBuffer) and can be device specific, e.g.:\n- The GL20 interface doesn't provide all LWJGL OpenGL functions (like glDrawBuffers)\n- afaik iOS always supports OES_depth_texture (and OES_depth_texture_cube_map?) \n- on Android its of course GPU specific, but can be checked against extensions (e.g on my Adreno its a NV extension)\n\nhttps://github.com/xoppa/libgdx/commit/f36cc96f7a1398470d199047ea4d207a4d46c2e3: add ShadowMap interface (provides a Texture and Matrix4). Added DirectionalShadowLight class, a shadowMap member to the Lights class and shadow mapping to the DefaultShader. Because of above reasons and this being a first draft and likely to be changed, I marked them as deprecated.\n\nhttps://github.com/xoppa/libgdx/commit/8b702873f2cdc19476c699acb2c6e248ab665987: Add shadow mapping to the Bullet and Animation3D tests.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/567/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/566","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/566/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/566/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/566/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/566","id":19150200,"number":566,"title":"Multi-Page Fonts & Tightly Packed FreeType Glyphs","user":{"login":"mattdesl","id":1383811,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1383811?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdesl","html_url":"https://github.com/mattdesl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdesl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdesl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdesl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdesl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdesl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdesl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdesl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdesl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattdesl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2013-09-07T19:12:14Z","updated_at":"2014-07-02T06:06:29Z","closed_at":"2013-09-16T05:29:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/566","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/566","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/566.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/566.patch"},"body":"# FRESH PULL REQUEST\n\nThis focuses on two features for bitmap fonts:\n- FreeTypeFontGenerator allows the user to specify their own PixmapPacker. This allows for tightly packing many glyphs into a single page.\n- BitmapFont, BitmapFontCache, and FreeTypeFontGenerator now support BMFont files with multiple glyphs pages.\n\nAs a result, `BitmapFontData.imagePath` and `BitmapFontData.getImagePath()` have been deprecated, and replaced by `imagePaths[]` and `getImagePath(int index)`. Likewise, the same has been done with the `getTextureRegion()` method of FreeTypeBitmapFontData. These could be removed if we're OK with breaking old code. \n\nUsers are encouraged to use `BitmapFont.getRegions()` and the TextureRegion[] constructor for greater compatibility with font files. I did not deprecate `BitmapFont.getRegion()` -- although maybe it should be, for consistency's sake.\n\nSee the CHANGES file, as well as FreeTypePackTest and BitmapFontTest. \n## BitmapFontWriter\n\nA utility in the gdx-tools package for writing bitmap font data to text or XML format -- can be used after generating with FreeType to cache the generated fonts and improve load time on mobile.\n## Future Thoughts:\n\nI am currently working on a tool which allows you to specify many BMFont files and TTF files, and it will **tightly** pack all their glyphs into the same texture(s). It then produces a JSON file with details for each FNT (size, name, etc), and ultimately a FontMapper class to facilitate the loading of them. I feel this does not quite belong in the LibGDX codebase; at least not until markup/multi-font text is added to scene2D and BitmapFontCache.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/566/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/565","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/565/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/565/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/565/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/565","id":19145122,"number":565,"title":"Added bounding box for particle effects.","user":{"login":"hneuer","id":1545118,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1545118?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hneuer","html_url":"https://github.com/hneuer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hneuer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hneuer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hneuer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hneuer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hneuer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hneuer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hneuer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hneuer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hneuer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2013-09-07T14:21:54Z","updated_at":"2013-09-13T11:37:34Z","closed_at":"2013-09-13T11:31:55Z","author_association":"OWNER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/565","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/565","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/565.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/565.patch"},"body":"It can be useful to have the bounds of a particle effect (I need it for a depth test in a sorting algorithm for rendering a 2.5d view).

glTexParameter values are stored with the texture, but DefaultTextureBinder caches them with the bind unit, resulting into parameters not set (see issue 1650).\n\nThe best place to store the texture context (glTexParameter values) would be in the Texture class, but that leads to three problems:\n- Texture always (re)binds the texture on setWrap and setFilter\n- Texture always sets the parameter, even if its the same\n- Texture forces you to use the TextureWrap and TextureFilter enums\n\nFor the first two problems I added the unsafeSetWrap and unsafeSetFilter methods, which assumes the texture is already bound and compares the previous value to avoid unneeded GL calls.\n\nFor the third problem I changed TextureDescriptor to use the TextureWrap and TextureFilter enums. Which I think for those values is fine. I haven't looked into other values yet (swizzle etc.).\n\nOn a side note: I can see how this can cause other problems e.g. when using 3d or depth textures (it might require DepthComponent (and consorts) to be added to the Format enum of Pixmap and perhaps the Gdx2DPixmap equivalent). I haven't looked in depth into this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/558/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/557","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/557/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/557/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/557/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/557","id":19048733,"number":557,"title":"Sound and Music for RoboVM-based iOS backend using ObjectAL.","user":{"login":"ntherning","id":135765,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/135765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntherning","html_url":"https://github.com/ntherning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntherning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntherning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntherning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntherning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntherning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntherning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntherning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntherning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntherning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2013-09-05T14:57:38Z","updated_at":"2014-06-14T05:09:35Z","closed_at":"2013-09-07T00:56:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/557","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/557","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/557.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/557.patch"},"body":"This adds Sound and Music support on iOS when using the RoboVM backend.
