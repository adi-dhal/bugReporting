notice that libGDX MapObject (used to interface with Tiled Map Object, see the [Tiled Map Editor](http://www.mapeditor.org/) ) does not have a method `getRotation()`. I also tried something like: `myMapObject.getProperties().get(\"rotation\", String.class)`.\n\nI think it could be easy to add this feature?\n\nFor now, I import the rotation in libGDX by copying by hand the _rotation property_ into a _custom property_ named `\"myRotation\"` (in Tiled).\n\nHowever, I noticed that libGDX has the position origin of its Objects on the bottom-left corner, while Tiled works with a position origin on the top-left corner.\nFor now, libGDX do the position translation by removing 1 on the y-axis.\n\nThis basic translation won't work if we want to take in account the rotation of Tiled objects.\nIf we want to correct it, for now, we need to add this vector to our MapObject position:\n\n``` java\nfloat rotation = Float.parseFloat(myMapObj.getProperties().get(\"myRotation\", String.class));\nfloat ysize = myMapObj.getsize().y\n\nVector2 correctionPos = new Vector2(0 + ysize*MathUtils.cosDeg(-rotation-90),\n                                    ysize + ysize*MathUtils.sinDeg(-rotation-90));\n\nmyMapObject.getPosition(new Vector2()).add(correctionPos)\n```\n\nThe +1 in the y-axis of `correctionPos` is to remove the basic translation made by libGDX.\nThe Cos and Sin of the complementary angle is the general solution to change from a top-left origin system to a bottom-left origin system (Note you need to multiply it by the ysize of your rectangle.). \nNote also that a rotation `r` in Tiled Editor is a rotation of `-r` is libGDX.\n\nSo I hope I bring with me every thing to allow an implemetation of the feature :D maybe I should try to do a pull request, but I never tried.\n\nPS: sorry if the feature already exists, I'm maybe on a old version of libGDX :/\n\nEDIT:\nI corrected the `correctionPos` vector. I replaced `1 + ysize*MathUtils.sinDeg(-rotation-90))` with `ysize + ysize*MathUtils.sinDeg(-rotation-90))`
