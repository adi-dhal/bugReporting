The atlas also contains button-specific images that I superimpose on the 9-patches. I think it's important that the 9-patches are bigger than the buttons. Being left handed, I flip the camera and Atlas (or individual regions.) \n\nThe result looks like a miscalculation in which some of the button-specific image has leaked into the 9-patch-only area and been stretched as if it were part of the 9-patch. \n\nSeems like a bug in TextureRegion.flip that affects 9-patches. My button code is as follows (It's in its own package so never mind the name clash on Button):\n\n```\npublic class Button extends ImageButton {\nstatic class Style {\n    public ImageButtonStyle buttonstyle;\n    Style(UiApp app, String id, char style, ChangeListener cl) {\n        Sprite s_up = app.atlas.createSprite(id);\n        Sprite s_down = new Sprite(s_up);\n        s_down.setColor(0.7f, 0.7f, 0.7f, 1.0f);\n        SpriteDrawable s_up_d = new SpriteDrawable(s_up);\n        SpriteDrawable s_down_d = new SpriteDrawable(s_down);\n        buttonstyle = new ImageButtonStyle(\n                app.button_up,\n                app.button_down,\n                style=='s' ? app.button_down : app.button_up,\n                s_up_d, \n                s_down_d,\n                style=='s' ? s_down_d : s_up_d);\n\n    }\n}\npublic Button(UiApp app, String id, char style, ChangeListener cl) {\n    super(new Style(app, id, style, cl).buttonstyle);\n    if (cl!=null)\n        addListener(cl);\n}\n```\n\n}\n\nThat code relies on the app having loaded the 9-patches as follows:\n\n```\n    button_up = new NinePatchDrawable(atlas.createPatch(\"button_up\"));\n    button_down = new NinePatchDrawable(atlas.createPatch(\"button_down\"));\n```\n\nI hope that's enough for you to reproduce the bug, but if not, I'm ready to help. The attached images are upside-down cos I worked around it that way, but that doesn't affect the bug.\n\n![bath](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/71239/2373640/fab29450-a853-11e3-9195-8c5217b570ff.png)\n![button_up 9](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/71239/2373641/facc19e8-a853-11e3-821c-9c339a0cea49.png)\n![button_down 9](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/71239/2373642/facd3a3a-a853-11e3-9993-1c57524ef939.png)\n\nRegards, Quorve.\nPS: libGDX is the most beautiful code I've seen in decades.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1453","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1453/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1453/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1453/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1453","id":29075718,"number":1453,"title":"EventAction, fixed previous commit","user":{"login":"semtiko","id":496349,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/496349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/semtiko","html_url":"https://github.com/semtiko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/semtiko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/semtiko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/semtiko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/semtiko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/semtiko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/semtiko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/semtiko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/semtiko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/semtiko/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-03-10T06:58:56Z","updated_at":"2014-06-20T12:02:03Z","closed_at":"2014-03-10T09:58:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/1453","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1453","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1453.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1453.patch"},"body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1453/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1452","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1452/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1452/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1452/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1452","id":29067210,"number":1452,"title":"Fix for infinite recursion","user":{"login":"JavadocMD","id":6167443,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6167443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavadocMD","html_url":"https://github.com/JavadocMD","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavadocMD/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavadocMD/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavadocMD/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavadocMD/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavadocMD/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavadocMD/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavadocMD/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavadocMD/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavadocMD/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-03-10T00:50:55Z","updated_at":"2014-03-10T06:09:35Z","closed_at":"2014-03-10T00:55:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/pulls/1452","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1452","diff_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1452.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/1452.patch"},"body":"The event listener's handle(event) was looping back on itself, causing StackOverflowError.

Today, i've tried to generate one of my project in a HTML5 version. I put the content of the WAR folder on my server. All is fine except 2 things.

It happens everytime.\n\nHere is the sample code which is automatically generated when you create a new project :\n\n``` java\npublic class TexDispose implements ApplicationListener\n{\n    private OrthographicCamera camera;\n    private SpriteBatch batch;\n    private Texture texture;\n\n    @Override\n    public void create() {      \n        float w = Gdx.graphics.getWidth();\n        float h = Gdx.graphics.getHeight();\n\n        camera = new OrthographicCamera(1, h/w);\n        batch = new SpriteBatch();\n\n        texture = new Texture(Gdx.files.internal(\"data/libgdx.png\"));\n        Gdx.input.setInputProcessor(this);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void dispose() {\n        batch.dispose();\n        texture.dispose(); // HERE IS THE ERROR\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void render() {      \n        Gdx.gl.glClearColor(1, 1, 1, 1);\n        Gdx.gl.glClear(GL10.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);\n\n        batch.setProjectionMatrix(camera.combined);\n        batch.begin();\n        batch.end();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void resize(int width, int height) {\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHas one of you already met this issue..?

However adding padding (so outlines are not cropped) makes the space between characters bigger. I can also set \"padding x\" to a negative value so they can get closer but this time it causes problems with centered texts. The string is shifted by that \"x\" value. \n\nHow can I can adding padding to character bitmaps while keeping the actual size of character same? Currently I achieved this by increasing xAdvance of each character by same amount of x padding so each character is also shifted by same amount to right which balances it out.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4883","x-ratelimit-reset":"1506844633","x-github-request-id":"E588:110A:2492658:40E04E5:59D096FC","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=117>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=164>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/5373551/issues?state=all&page=115>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"966b651e2ffa22220ee44b0da98da320\"","status":"200 OK"}}
