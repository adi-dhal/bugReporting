here's the deal:\n1. I create a new scene and fetch inside it a layer with additional sprites and events.\n2. One of these sprites has a physics body.\n3. That precise sprite (with a physics body) doesn't appear in the scene when running the game, when I try to change its position (with a mouse event) it then appears.\n4. Contact between that sprite and additional bullets sprites doesn't trigger any callback. (Bitmasks and category and testconactbitmask are all set up properly).\nHowever all of these happens only when I create a new custom scene, if I edit directly the built-in \"HelloWorld\" scene then everything is alright (well, expect for physical contact callbacks which don't happen whatsoever).\n\nThing is, this is really starting to become annoying as I cannot continue with further projects
