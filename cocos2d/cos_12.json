think this should be merged after GLFW has been updated to 3.2.1 (Issue #17700), but for some strange reason this pull request works on my Windows machine without the GLFW update. Back on issue #16481 the joysticks didn't work on that same Windows machine I tested this code on.\r\n\r\nThere is a small trivial GLFW issue in 3.2.1 due to some hat buttons, or the D-pad on some controllers, being mapped as joystick axes. The workaround is trivial -- it's just a matter of identifying these buttons in the callbacks and mapping them to the respective functions these buttons should call. On GLFW 3.3, which is under development, the joystick API has been updated to provide a separate call to get the state of those hat buttons and as far as I can tell this code will have to be updated once GLFW 3.3 is stable and released with Cocos2D-X.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell the code in this pull request should also work on Mac, but it remains untested. I noticed there was already a game controller implementation for Mac and decided to leave it as is, just to not break any current projects that upgrade if this pull request gets merged.\r\n\r\nOne last issue is that the button key codes returned by GLFW differ greatly from the keys found in [Controller.h](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/blob/v3/cocos/base/CCController.h#L57-L93). There is no standard between the two controllers I tested the code with, and as a result I decided to leave it as is and not add any other key codes in there.\r\n\r\nThe code I used for testing this PR is currently here: https://github.com/Rubonnek/cocos2d-x-controller-test/tree/master/Classes\r\n\r\nJust replace `HelloWorldScene.cpp` and `HelloWorldScene.h` in a new project and build. \r\n\r\nI'll add a controller test to cpp-tests later if needed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17989","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17989/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17989/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17989/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17989","id":238641190,"number":17989,"title":"touch

Open the app;\r\n2. Do any Director::getInstance()->replaceScene();\r\n3. Touch the screen;\r\n\r\nAfter android discontinued some build commands, we were forced to update cocos2dx to the newest version, because we had to update some libraries too. After that, we started getting a ton of complaints about the screen being unresponsive. At this point 5% (1/20) sessions becomes unresponsive after the first replaceScene call. \r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter what device, when the app is closed and reopened 20 times, we'll get at least 1 unresponsive state. \r\n\r\nHow we proved this bug:\r\n. We did EventListenerTouchAllAtOnce::create() with a simple CCLOG in the first and second scene.\r\nIt works perfectly 100% times in the first scene. After the first replaceScene is called, it works only 80% of all cases in the second scene.\r\n. After downgrading cocos library to 3.14.1 it works 100% again.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17989/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17988","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17988/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17988/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17988/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17988","id":238636758,"number":17988,"title":"libc.so tgkill","user":{"login":"deguilardi","id":16661903,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16661903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deguilardi","html_url":"https://github.com/deguilardi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deguilardi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deguilardi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deguilardi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deguilardi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deguilardi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deguilardi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deguilardi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deguilardi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deguilardi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-06-26T18:55:26Z","updated_at":"2017-08-18T23:38:54Z","closed_at":"2017-08-18T23:38:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- cocos2d-x version: 3.14.1\r\n- devices test on: varius\r\n- developing environments\r\n   - NDK version: 15.0.4075724 (bundle)\r\n   - Xcode version: 8.3.3 (8E3004b)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nThis error occurs 1 time for each 200 times you open the app. Android 6 and 7 only.\r\nThe app crashes on startup.

But i don't think use `release` mode by default is a good idea. It is better if can change to use release mode in command line, then jenkins can check both `debug` and `release` modes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17974/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17973","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17973/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17973/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17973/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17973","id":238092445,"number":17973,"title":"cocos gen-libs - does not work witk latest android sdk","user":{"login":"crazyhappygame","id":13263288,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13263288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crazyhappygame","html_url":"https://github.com/crazyhappygame","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crazyhappygame/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crazyhappygame/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crazyhappygame/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crazyhappygame/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crazyhappygame/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crazyhappygame/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crazyhappygame/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crazyhappygame/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crazyhappygame/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-06-23T09:40:43Z","updated_at":"2017-07-03T09:49:02Z","closed_at":"2017-07-03T09:49:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- cocos2d-x version: 15.1\r\n- devices test on: \r\n- developing environments\r\n   - NDK version:14b\r\n   - Xcode version:\r\n   - VS version:\r\n   - browser type and version:\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. cocos gen-libs -p android --app-abi armeabi-v7a\r\nError:\r\nAnt (Eclipse project) is not supported from Android SDK Tools 25.3.0.\r\nError running command, return code: 101.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17973/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17972","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17972/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17972/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17972/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17972","id":238084764,"number":17972,"title":"No window after install Debian","user":{"login":"Ivosu","id":13063881,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/13063881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ivosu","html_url":"https://github.com/Ivosu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ivosu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ivosu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ivosu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ivosu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ivosu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ivosu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ivosu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ivosu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ivosu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-06-23T09:10:57Z","updated_at":"2017-07-03T09:47:55Z","closed_at":"2017-07-03T09:47:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hey,\r\nI have Debian 9 (Stretch).
