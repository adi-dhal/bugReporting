I'll try to take a look at this later on, but I won't be able anytime soon.\n\nNote: I've also tested this on Linux and Android builds, but this issue only shows up using VS 2015.

cocos2d-x version: latest v3 (d41124a5b1fc4fe42c421a5d9e92f9d122c0330b)\n- devices test on: iPhone6 (iOS 9.3.2)\n- developing environments\n  - Xcode version: 7.3.1\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Bring up the Control Center, play Wannabe by Spice Girls\n2. Run game that has music\n3. Notice game music doesn't play (good)\n4. Reopen Control Center\n5. Pause Spice Girls\n6. Close Control Center, game music doesn't start playing\n\nThis is using the `SimpleAudioEngine`. I have set this on and do no manual pausing/unpausing of music in the app `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`\n\n``` objc\n[[CDAudioManager sharedManager] setResignBehavior:kAMRBStopPlay autoHandle:YES];\n[[CDAudioManager sharedManager] setMode:kAMM_FxPlusMusicIfNoOtherAudio];\n```\n\nIf you launch the game _without_ external music, then play external music from the control center, the game music stops, and when you pause the external music the game music resumes (as desired).\n\nSo it seems like launching with external music playing puts it into a special mode which is not desired in our use case.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16356/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16355","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16355/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16355/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16355/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16355","id":170698558,"number":16355,"title":"Replace
