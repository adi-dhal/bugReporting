The problem is it already returned the empty image to the calling routine (cc._imgLoader.load()) which caches it using the url. When the loadImg() succeeds the second time around,  loadImg() caches the newly loaded image as well but using the realUrl (which appears to be a fully qualified url) instead of the url so the image was loaded but not cached in such a way that it can be accessed. Everything seems to access it through the url which is now an empty image and all of the images disappear.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15043/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15042","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15042/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15042/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15042/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15042","id":133014893,"number":15042,"title":"CCFontFNT missing _fontSize on binary fonts.","user":{"login":"WarlockD","id":1102671,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1102671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WarlockD","html_url":"https://github.com/WarlockD","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WarlockD/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WarlockD/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WarlockD/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WarlockD/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WarlockD/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WarlockD/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WarlockD/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WarlockD/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WarlockD/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-02-11T16:06:02Z","updated_at":"2016-03-29T03:23:42Z","closed_at":"2016-03-29T03:23:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Was trying to use some binary fonts when, for some reason, the fonts came out with no fontSize.
