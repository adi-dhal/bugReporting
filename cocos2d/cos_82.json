are a lot of files generated by cocos2d-x that in general one would want to exclude from version control in their project, but it is really hard to know which files those are. This means any time you build your project there can be hundreds of generated files to check in, and it becomes very confusing. Not to mention, it can cause issues if developing in multiple environments. (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36928128/compiling-cocos2d-x-project-on-both-linux-and-osx)\n\nOne of the great things about cocos2d-x is that you don't necessarily need to have a deep understanding of iOS/Android development. Unfortunately, if you don't understand what all the files and directories are for, it is very difficult to know what can be excluded.\n\nIn my opinion it would be great if a `.gitignore` file was generated when creating a new cocos project, as I assume a large majority of developers are using git as their VCS. Would this be possible?\n\nIf not, it would be great if there was at least a list somewhere in the documentation of all the files that should be excluded from version control.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15883/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15882","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15882/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15882/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15882/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/15882","id":160997197,"number":15882,"title":"fix: underline will have the same solor as text in TTF","user":{"login":"ricardoquesada","id":232330,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/232330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada","html_url":"https://github.com/ricardoquesada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/milestones/29","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/milestone/29","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/milestones/29/labels","id":1768287,"number":29,"title":"3.13","description":"","creator":{"login":"minggo","id":488203,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/488203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo","html_url":"https://github.com/minggo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":169,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-05-16T09:52:30Z","updated_at":"2016-08-29T07:25:14Z","due_on":"2016-08-29T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-08-29T07:25:14Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-06-18T00:26:31Z","updated_at":"2016-06-18T01:09:13Z","closed_at":"2016-06-18T01:09:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pulls/15882","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/15882","diff_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/15882.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/15882.patch"},"body":"underline will have the same solor as text in TTF when calling\n`setColor`.

(Today, using cocos2d-x v3.11.1)\n\nI compile using visual studio 2015 community.\n\nFound that the problem is the time it takes to Angle to transform/compile the cocos shaders. On my game (I use cocos2d-x v3.10 for it) I managed to implement [this optimization](https://github.com/Microsoft/angle/wiki/Caching-compiled-program-binaries) modifying GLProgram::initWithByteArrays()  and GLProgram::link() mainly.\n\nImplementing that optimization reduced my startup time from 5 to 1 second on that device, but that's after second start. First one must precompile and write shaders to device so it's still slow. Being slow on first run has result in many of my users on windows device trying the game, and then quitting while it's starting as they think it's broken or not working, thus uninstalling it and not giving a second chance to see if it runs or not. That's not  a desired behavior and that's the reason I believe this isn't a real fix.\n\nWould love to see any other trick/magic on windows port that really improves startup time, and would be nice to see it done on cocos library so every new game people creates benefits from it.\n\nI can clean up and adapt my code for v3.11 branch if needed, but as stated before, I 'believe' that's not the path to follow as I'm interested in good startup times from the very

AND MORE COMMENTS NEED TO BE ADDED.\n\nThis Pull Request has done the following things:\n- Supports to preload small audio files and cache them with PCM data buffer\n- MP3/Ogg/... files are decoded to PCM data by OpenSLES API\n- Decoded PCM buffer data matches the best sample rate & buffer size in frames of device by using resampling source code in Android Source (Android 6.0, platform/frameworks/av)\n- Big refactoring for the implementation of AudioEngineImpl for Android, better class responsibility\n- Mixing audio clips by ourself, in this way, we only need a single OpenSLES AudioPlayer for playing many clips and this will fix latency of making a AudioPlayer active and play a track. For now, we only support 32 audio clips being played simultaneously. But AudioEngine module has limited  it to 24 clips by default.\n- Adds audio performance test case\n- Supports to preload audio files asynchronously.\n\nPlease help to test it on the Android devices which have low performance.
