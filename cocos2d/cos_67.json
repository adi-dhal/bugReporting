Added BM Font support for text elements\n- Added Sprite frame support for image elements\n- Added means to align RichText elements on their baseline\n  - Added means to obtain the ascent (used as baseline offset) for BM Font, TTF and system font (on Windows, Linux, and Android only for now; through Texture2D)\n\nRichText::setAlignToBaseline supports 3 values:\n- ALL: align all elements on the text baseline (default on Android, Windows and Linux).\n- TEXT: align only text element on their baseline, the images positioned on the bottom.\n- NONE: no baseline alignment, all elements are positioned on the bottom (same as before, default for all other platforms).\n\nTo work correctly on Linux with system fonts it needs the fix from:

follows the discussion around the PR by JAKZ to use templates to reduce code of ease actions.\n\nMy original PR with only slight modifications to fix build issues with JAKZ PR.\nhttps://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/16159\n\nUse MACROs instead of templates in order to allow for ease of binding generation without requiring updates to LLVM and the bindings-generator repo.\n\nWhile I did test out adding support for templates to the binding generator using LLVM 3.5+ and ignoring the direct template classes in Lua I felt that an improved action/ease/rate/tween system for v4 would be better use of time. \n\nIf people dislike MACROs for this use case just close this one as well.\n\nThe goal here would be to simplify changes to the ease actions as well as allow easy generation of new ones for 3.13+. Since this code changes infrequently it may be overkill.\n\nThis PR was not too much work to convert the templates to MACROs so I figured I might as well submit it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16335/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16334","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16334/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16334/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16334/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16334","id":169752416,"number":16334,"title":"在IOS下播放MP3没声音，3.12","user":{"login":"ericanne","id":20876607,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/20876607?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericanne","html_url":"https://github.com/ericanne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericanne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericanne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericanne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericanne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericanne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericanne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericanne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericanne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericanne/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-08-06T15:48:40Z","updated_at":"2016-08-07T04:14:23Z","closed_at":"2016-08-07T04:14:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"不好意思，自己的问题\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16334/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16333","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16333/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16333/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16333/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/16333","id":169738638,"number":16333,"title":"Remove

cocos2d-x version: 3.11\n- devices test on: iPad Air 2\n- developing environments\n  - NDK version: N/A\n  - Xcode version: 7.2.1\n  - VS version: N/A\n  - brower type and version:\n\nWe have discovered several large and concerning memory leaks originating from spidermonkey in our Cocos2d-x project on the iOS platform. We have not confirmed if this issue is or isn't happening on other platforms due to lack of good memory leak tooling on our other development platform (Android). Our rough polling of Heap Size in my Android application seems to suggest that this issue is also happening on Android, but we don't have solid proof of this. The two principle leaks seem to originate from the following two actions:\n- Calling eval (either directly or indirectly) on any script code will leak the string of the evaluated code.\n- Calling a function that has undergone cc.Class's _super variable replacement will cause the \"ArgumentsData\" object of Spidermonkeys Internal \"ArgumentsObject\" to leak. ArgumentsObject here is spidermonkeys internal C++ representation of the \"arguments\" object in a Javascript function. \n\nWe believe this is related to issue https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16291, and that issue is caused by these leaks. \n\nExamining either of these action's in Apple's Instruments program produces the following data:\n\nThese are the stacks for the Eval case\n![screen shot 2016-08-05 at 2 17 41 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7245174/17450856/9dbd03c4-5b17-11e6-8e26-5edec404f2d7.png)\n![screen shot 2016-08-05 at 2 17 19 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7245174/17450868/a15ae46a-5b17-11e6-9cc6-54caf81a8df3.png)\n\nThis is the stack for the arguments case\n![screen shot 2016-08-05 at 2 17 19 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7245174/17450888/c5303bce-5b17-11e6-80d6-b0126c42f0cc.png)\n\nFor the eval() case\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Examine a Cocos2d-x application with the Instruments program, examining memory leaks.\n2. Repeated eval a string of arbitrary Javascript.\n3. Watch as leaked memory rises.\n\nFor the _super case\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Examine a Cocos2d-x application with the Instruments program, examining memory leaks.\n2. Run the following code:\n\n```\nvar HelloWorld = cc.Layer.extend({\n                    ctor:function () {\n                        this._super();\n                        this.scheduleUpdate();\n                    },\n                    update: function () {\n                        var node = new cc.Node();\n                        this.addChild(node);\n                        this.scheduleOnce(function () {\n                            node.removeFromParent();\n                        });\n                    }\n                });\n\n```\n1. Watch as leaked memory rises.\n2. Now, if you were to create an update function that does not undergo super replacement, this leak will not occur.
