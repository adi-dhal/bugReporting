part of my PhD research on code authorship, we calculated the Truck Factor (TF) of some popular GitHub repositories.\n\nAs you probably know, the [Truck (or Bus) Factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) designates the minimal number of developers that have to be hit by a truck (or quit) before a project is incapacitated. In our work, we consider that a system is in trouble if more than 50% of its files become orphan (i.e., without a main author).\n\nMore details on our work in this preprint: https://peerj.com/preprints/1233\n\nWe calculated the TF for **cocos2d-x** and obtained a value of **6**.\n\nThe developers responsible for this TF are:\n\nJames Chen - author of 38% of the files\nCocosRobot - author of 17% of the files\nminggo - author of 11% of the files\nRicardo Quesada - author of 10% of the files\nyangxiao - author of 9% of the files\nsamuele3hu - author of 6% of the files\n\nTo validate our results, we would like to ask **cocos2d-x** developers the following three brief questions:\n\n(a) Do you agree that the listed developers are the main developers of **cocos2d-x**?\n\n(b) Do you agree that **cocos2d-x** will be in trouble if the listed developers leave the project (e.g., if they win in the lottery, to be less morbid)?\n\n(c) Does **cocos2d-x** have some characteristics that would attenuate the loss of the listed developers (e.g., detailed documentation)?\n\nThanks in advance for your collaboration,\n\nGuilherme Avelino\nPhD Student\nApplied Software Engineering Group (ASERG)\nUFMG, Brazil\nhttp://aserg.labsoft.dcc.ufmg.br/\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13303","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13303/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13303/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13303/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/13303","id":100080571,"number":13303,"title":"Fix
