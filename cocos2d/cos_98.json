的时候会做一些安全的检测，这种情况下，运行程序不会crash，且正确的抛出的错误信息，但是到了release 却少了这个关键的安全检测，导致 拿到的 cobj 可能为 nullptr然后就下就是crash了。\n在实际开发过程中，由于我们的log信息太多，在测试的时候很有可能忽略这些报错的log信息，导致我们一打包到手机时就可能会crash，而且在那个时候对于手机crash信息也不方便，如果能够让 在 debug 的时候打印错误且直接crash的时候能够方便在测试阶段及时发现问题，release 的时候也加上这些安全性的检测保证发行包的稳定性将会更加的棒。\n\n以上是我在开发过程中的一下感受，望采纳。祝 cocos2d-x 越来越好。。。。\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15408/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15407","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15407/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15407/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15407/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/15407","id":147307111,"number":15407,"title":"Sync
