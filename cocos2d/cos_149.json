Version: 3.6\n\nTo reproduce: create a spine animation, free textureCache from spine texture and make run another time the animation. This scenario is tipical for animation that required a big atlas. In a scene you show an animation, for memory reson you free textureCache but no memory will be free and the second time you run the animation another texture was loaded.\n\nMotivation:\nI notice that then used spine from js, but I'm sure the same problem is present also in c++ enviroment, texture of atlas cannot be released never.\nThis is due to initialize() method, where it is called and what it
