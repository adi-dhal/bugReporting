cocos 2d-x is integrated on top of UIKit,that is,we have a few native iOS view controllers and then move into cocos 2d-x screen,the application works fine.Now,when we move back to iOS screen from the cocos 2d-x screen by invoking Director::getInstance()->end(),without exiting the application,we are able to transition back to iOS screen from cocos 2d-x screen without problems.Supposing there is a text field in the iOS screen and we tap on the text field after transitioning from the cocos 2d-x screen,the application crashes when the keyboard is to be shown up for the textfield in the iOS screen.This is because the UIKeyboardNotification which was set on the glView of the cocos 2d-x screen has not been removed when releasing the glView during Director::getInstance()->end() and the UIKeyboardNotification is still active and called on the released glView.On inspecting the code in CCEAGLView-ios.mm file,in the dealloc method,the UIKeyboardNotification is being removed and other cleanup of the glview is done.But when Director::getInstance()->end() is invoked it does not invoke the dealloc method of CCEAGLView at all.Hence the UIKeyboardNotification is still active even though the glView is released.Could the Director::getInstance()->end() functionality be improvised so that the dealloc method of CCEAGLView-ios.mm is invoked implicitly?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15733/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15732","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15732/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15732/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15732/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/15732","id":156940410,"number":15732,"title":"fix
