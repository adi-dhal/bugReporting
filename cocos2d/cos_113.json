PR is for [Issue 15210](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15210). \n\n---\n\nIssue 15210:\n\nI've been using cocos2d-x v2.2.3 for a long time. Recently, My cocos program crashed on Windows because of the call of logForOpenGLObject() function when I have some errors in my shaders. Then I checked v3 branch, and I found that the problem have been fixed already. However, I've found that these two functions : `logForOpenGLShader()` and `logForOpenGLProgram()` have some flaws:\n\n``` c++\nstatic std::string logForOpenGLShader(GLuint shader)\n{\n    std::string ret;\n    GLint logLength = 0, charsWritten = 0;\n\n    glGetShaderiv(shader, GL_INFO_LOG_LENGTH, &logLength);\n    if (logLength < 1)\n        return \"\";\n\n    char *logBytes = (char*)malloc(logLength + 1);\n    glGetShaderInfoLog(shader, logLength, &charsWritten, logBytes);\n    logBytes[logLength] = '\\0';\n    ret = logBytes;\n\n    free(logBytes);\n    return ret;\n}\n```\n1. I think maybe we should define `std::string ret` in where we really need it. According to my test on android platform the function returns at `return \"\";`, which makes the `ret` unnecessary.\n2. `charsWritten` is not used, it's better to use it or delete it. Because the codes don't check the bytes written, I think we can just delete it.\n3.  (logLength+1) space for `logBytes` is too much, because `logBytes`  returned by calling `glGetShaderInfoLog(shader, logLength, nullptr, logBytes)` takes `logLength` bytes at most, including the ending null character,  i.e. `(strlen(logBytes) + 1 ==  logLength)` always yield true. According to the offical opengles sdk docs: https://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glGetShaderInfoLog.xml.\n   and\n   https://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glGetShaderiv.xml\n4. `logBytes[logLength] = '\\0' is unnecessary, because`logBytes` returned is already null-terminated.\n\n`logForOpenGLProgram()` has the same flaws as `logForOpenGLShader`.\n\nI've created a [pull request](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/14965) for this issue, following are the codes modified:\n\n``` c++\nstatic std::string logForOpenGLShader(GLuint shader)\n{\n    GLint logLength = 0;\n\n    glGetShaderiv(shader, GL_INFO_LOG_LENGTH, &logLength);\n    if (logLength < 1)\n        return \"\";\n\n    char *logBytes = (char*)malloc(sizeof(char) * logLength);\n    glGetShaderInfoLog(shader, logLength, nullptr, logBytes);\n    std::string ret(logBytes);\n\n    free(logBytes);\n    return ret;\n}\n\nstatic std::string logForOpenGLProgram(GLuint program)\n{\n    GLint logLength = 0;\n\n    glGetProgramiv(program, GL_INFO_LOG_LENGTH, &logLength);\n    if (logLength < 1)\n        return \"\";\n\n    char *logBytes = (char*)malloc(sizeof(char) * logLength);\n    glGetProgramInfoLog(program, logLength, nullptr, logBytes);\n    std::string ret(logBytes);\n\n    free(logBytes);\n    return ret;\n}\n```\n\nBy doing this, we save 1 byte and one GLint: `charsWritten' and shorter codes.\n\nMaybe you think this is a trivial fix, but it's good for the better future of cocos. Please consider merge this pull request, Every little helps.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14965/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14964","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14964/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14964/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14964/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/14964","id":128453521,"number":14964,"title":"fix pageview page turning event issue","user":{"login":"zilongshanren","id":785541,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/785541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zilongshanren","html_url":"https://github.com/zilongshanren","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zilongshanren/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zilongshanren/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zilongshanren/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zilongshanren/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zilongshanren/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zilongshanren/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zilongshanren/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zilongshanren/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zilongshanren/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-01-25T03:54:17Z","updated_at":"2016-02-04T07:25:26Z","closed_at":"2016-01-27T12:53:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pulls/14964","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/14964","diff_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/14964.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/14964.patch"},"body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14964/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14963","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14963/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14963/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14963/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/14963","id":128451030,"number":14963,"title":"Optimize the OpenGL Log Functions in CCGLProgram.cpp","user":{"login":"elloop","id":1855317,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1855317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloop","html_url":"https://github.com/elloop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloop/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-01-25T03:18:48Z","updated_at":"2016-01-25T04:17:56Z","closed_at":"2016-01-25T04:17:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pulls/14963","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/14963","diff_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/14963.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/14963.patch"},"body":"Following codes are the original OpenGL log function in CCGLProgram.cpp.\n\n``` c++\nstatic std::string logForOpenGLShader(GLuint shader)\n{\n    std::string ret;\n    GLint logLength = 0, charsWritten = 0;\n\n    glGetShaderiv(shader, GL_INFO_LOG_LENGTH, &logLength);\n    if (logLength < 1)\n        return \"\";\n\n    char *logBytes = (char*)malloc(logLength + 1);\n    glGetShaderInfoLog(shader, logLength, &charsWritten, logBytes);\n    logBytes[logLength] = '\\0';\n    ret = logBytes;\n\n    free(logBytes);\n    return ret;\n}\n```\n1.

`./download-deps.sh` and `./install-deps-linux.sh`) the build will still crash with this error:\n\n`/bin/debug/linux/MyGame: error while loading shared libraries: libfmod.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`\n\nThe way to fix this is to copy the `libfmod.so` and `libfmodL.so` to `/usr/local/lib/` and the `fmod.h` files to `/usr/local/include/`. I was wondering if we could add this to the `install-deps-linux.sh` script.\n\nThe commands:\n`sudo cp <*COCOS FOLDER LOCATION*>/external/linux-specific/fmod/prebuilt/64-bit/libfmod.so /usr/local/lib/`\n\n`sudo cp  <*COCOS FOLDER LOCATION*>/external/linux-specific/fmod/prebuilt/64-bit/libfmodL.so /usr/local/lib/`\n\n`sudo cp <*COCOS FOLDER LOCATION*>/external/linux-specific/fmod/include/*.h /usr/local/include/`\n\nThen Run the script  install-deps-linux again\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14961/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14960","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14960/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14960/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14960/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14960","id":128407008,"number":14960,"title":"Generated Prelibs for all platforms, rather than selective ones?","user":{"login":"TheSachin","id":8872840,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/8872840?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheSachin","html_url":"https://github.com/TheSachin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheSachin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheSachin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheSachin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheSachin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheSachin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheSachin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheSachin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheSachin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheSachin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-01-24T16:17:53Z","updated_at":"2016-04-30T17:16:03Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\nI fail to understand why we are not shipping prebuilt version of Windows platform, is absence mere cause of less Windows platform devices, or is there something else as well?\nEdit : Windows 10 Store\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14960/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14959","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14959/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14959/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14959/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14959","id":128405017,"number":14959,"title":"RenderTexture + Stencil fails on Tegra devices (Nexus 7)","user":{"login":"Obg1","id":2327620,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2327620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Obg1","html_url":"https://github.com/Obg1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Obg1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Obg1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Obg1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Obg1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Obg1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Obg1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Obg1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Obg1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Obg1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-01-24T15:33:28Z","updated_at":"2016-02-18T03:03:23Z","closed_at":"2016-02-18T03:03:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The problem is in glRenderbufferStorage when using GL_DEPTH24_STENCIL8 as second parameter.

We should define `std::string ret` in where we really need it. According to my test on android platform the function returns at `return \"\";`, which makes the `ret` unnecessary.\n2. `charsWritten` is not used, we should either delete it or use it. Because we don't check the bytes written, I think we can just delete it.\n3.  We don't need (logLength+1) space for `logBytes`, because `logBytes`  returned by calling glGetShaderInfoLog(shader, logLength, nullptr, logBytes) takes `logLength` bytes at most, including the ending null character,  i.e. `(strlen(logBytes) + 1 ==  logLength)` always yield true. According to the offical opengles sdk docs: https://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glGetShaderInfoLog.xml.\n   and\n   https://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glGetShaderiv.xml\n4. We don't need `logBytes[logLength] = '\\0';`, because `logBytes` returned is already null-terminated.\n\nso, maybe we can change the codes to:\n\n``` c++\nstatic std::string logForOpenGLShader(GLuint shader)\n{\n    GLint logLength = 0;\n\n    glGetShaderiv(shader, GL_INFO_LOG_LENGTH, &logLength);\n    if (logLength < 1)\n        return \"\";\n\n    char *logBytes = (char*)malloc(logLength);\n    glGetShaderInfoLog(shader, logLength, nullptr, logBytes);\n    std::string ret(logBytes);\n\n    free(logBytes);\n    return ret;\n}\n\n```\n\njust like the codes in the \"Gold Book\", \"OpenGL ES 2.0 Programming Guide\" : \n\n``` c++\nif(!compiled)\n{\n    GLint infoLen = 0;\n\n    glGetShaderiv(shader, GL_INFO_LOG_LENGTH, &infoLen);\n\n    if(infoLen > 1)\n    {\n        char* infoLog = malloc(sizeof(char) * infoLen);\n        glGetShaderInfoLog(shader, infoLen, NULL, infoLog);\n        esLogMessage(\"Error compiling shader:\\n%s\\n\", infoLog);\n\n        free(infoLog);\n    }\n\n    glDeleteShader(shader);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nthe same things happen with logForOpenGLProgram().\n\n``` c++\nstatic std::string logForOpenGLProgram(GLuint program)\n{\n    GLint logLength = 0;\n\n    glGetProgramiv(program, GL_INFO_LOG_LENGTH, &logLength);\n    if (logLength < 1)\n        return \"\";\n\n    char *logBytes = (char*)malloc(sizeof(char) * logLength);\n
