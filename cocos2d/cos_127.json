Problem\n\nAfter upgrading my employer's game from Cocos2d-x 3.8.1 to 3.9, the AssetManagerEx failed to work properly. After some investigation I fixed 2 bugs that lies in the new iOS & Android native Downloaders. \n\nThe game involved has 3000+ asset files managed by the AssetManagerEx.\n### iOS https://github.com/cezheng/cocos2d-x/commit/ecf94a3dc4fbfd3e9764021657713ec21a527e4d\n\nUpon calling NSURLSessionDownloadTask's resume, the task's timeout\ncountdown starts. When the AssetManagerEx starts downloading, it creates\nall the tasks all at once and just `resume` upon creation. When the\nnumber of asset files is very large, later tasks tend to end up in\n'request timed out -1001' error before they can even start downloading.\nThis commit adds a buffer queue to prevent all the NSURLSessionTasks to\nstart all at once.\n\n> Without this fix, our game was able to download 1200 of the 3000+ files(which means in the default timeout setting, we were able to download 1200 files while the other 2000 files timedout without even starting)\n### Android https://github.com/cezheng/cocos2d-x/commit/d174a98afa20abf1e6c949d1571c966af977d4d8\n\nWhen the AssetManagerEx start downloading, it used to create all the\ndownload tasks all at once. When the app has a large number of asset\nfiles, it is likely to crash due to out of memory when creating threads\nfor each of the download tasks. This commit adds a buffer queue to the\ndownloader to use the `countOfMaxProcessingTasks` property from hints,\npreventing all the tasks from starting all at once.\n\n> Without this fix, the downloader seems to be creating a lot of threads all at once causing out of memory error.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14530/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14529","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14529/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14529/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14529/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14529","id":119650709,"number":14529,"title":"CCFastTMXLayer
