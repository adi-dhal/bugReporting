we have cc.textureCache.addImageAsync to load online image with url which is async.\n\nBut after downloaded image, it will invoke Image::initWithImageData to create the texture which will blocking the main thread and cause freeze.\n\nThus, the whole process is not fully asynchronous as Image::initWithImageData is synchronous.\n\nIn this case, i would like to request implementation of Image::initWithImageDataAsync to make the loading image process fully asynchronous.\n\nThe original issue cc.textureCache.addImageAsync is at here :\nhttps://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-js/issues/1217\n\nFrom @pandamicro \n\n> Do we must invoke Image::initWithImageData after the image data downloaded to buffer?\n\nFor image data downloaded to buffer, yes.\nFor image downloaded to file, no, we can use other APIs.\n\n> Why the frozen issue is not happen on Mac but only Android and iOS?\n\nCCImage implementation is in the platform folder, so it's platform related and its performance may vary between different platforms\n\nThanks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12857/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12856","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12856/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12856/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12856/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/12856","id":95112957,"number":12856,"title":"fixed

encountered this problem when I started cutting the level in my game in to smaller peices. I am using a sprite atlas exported from TexturePacker. If I move my Cocos2d::Camera (orthographic) in the Y axis the rect for each sprite frame appears to be changing its offset 1 by pixel. It doesn't happen consistently every frame, but maybe every 4-5 frames. \nThere is a visible offset of the spriteframe and I know the rect is changing because I can see the first line of pixels from the frame above that particular frame in the sprite atlas is getting drawn. I've tried every option in TexturePacker and I'm convinced that's not the problem. I'm 99% it's something going wrong in the Cocos2D-x engine.\n\nIt should be fairly simple to reproduce, export a texture pack (sprite atlas) with a few images. Run it on a device, I used iPhone 4S. Then move the camera every frame on the y-axis, I moved it up (+0.1f). I have also tested it on an Android device (Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 10.1) and it still happens.\n\nIt's worth mentioning the problem appears to go away if running on the iOS simulator or in Win32, hopefully that may help to fix it. \n\nIt's also worth mentioning that the problem appears to happen rather sporadically, i.e. it has no set pattern. My first thought was floating point innacuracies in the shader or something.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12847/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12846","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12846/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12846/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12846/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/12846","id":94914075,"number":12846,"title":"[ci
