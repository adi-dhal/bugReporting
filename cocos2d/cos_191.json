is a fix for Github issue #8305\n\nThe current purge->reset behavior occurs per label according to scene\ngraph priority.  This has two disadvanages; firstly, any labels that are\ninitialized but not part of the scene graph will not be reset.\nSecondly, any labels which share atlases in the FontAtlasCache may not\nbe reset since each label will call releaseFontAtlas individually before\nresetting its fontConfig.  This means that any shared atlases may not be\nreleased all the way to a reference count of 0 and the invalid atlas\nwill not be deleted and reset from scratch.\n\nBy putting a fixed priority on both the purge and reset steps we can\nensure that firstly: all labels will be reset regardless of whether they\nhave been added to the scene-graph.  Secondly, ALL labels with the same\natlas must call releaseFontAtlas before any others are allowed to\nrebuild their textures.  This will prevent any old atlases from sticking\naround after a new GL context is created.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12609/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12608","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12608/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12608/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12608/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12608","id":92084496,"number":12608,"title":"WinRT
