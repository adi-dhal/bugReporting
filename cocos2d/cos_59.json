cocos2d-x version: 3.13.1\n- devices test on: Nexus 5X, Nexus 9, Nexus 6P\n- developing environments\n  - NDK version: r10e\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Play an MP3 audio file using AudioEngine::play2d(\"file.mp3\") on Android 6.0, 5.0, 4.4, 4.0 and notice how there is very little lag without preloading the audio file.\n2. Update phone to Android 7.0 (Nexus 5X, Nexus 9, Pixel C, and Nexus 6P have supported images at the time)\n3. Play an MP3 audio file using AudioEngine::play2d(\"file.mp3\") also without preloading\n4. Notice the long delay in starting playback of the audio file and how the entire UI is locked up. We've seen cases where calling \"AudioEngine::play2d(\"file.mp3\")\" on a 500k MP3 file causes a 2-3 second lock up of the UI. The exact same device running Android 6.0 or below and playing the exact same audio file using the same AudioEngine code has no noticeable playback lag and does not appear to lock up the UI for a noticeable amount of time.\n\nWe've been able to reproduce this behavior on Nexus 5X, Nexus 9 (wifi), and Nexus 6P running a before and after test with Cocos2D-X 3.13.1, Android 6.0 (plays fine) and on Android 7.0.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16590/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16589","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16589/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16589/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16589/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16589","id":177548394,"number":16589,"title":"Compile on macOS failed.","user":{"login":"liketemple","id":10526411,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10526411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liketemple","html_url":"https://github.com/liketemple","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liketemple/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liketemple/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liketemple/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liketemple/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liketemple/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liketemple/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liketemple/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liketemple/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liketemple/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":231439712,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/labels/platform:ios","name":"platform:ios","color":"fbca04","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/milestones/30","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/milestone/30","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/milestones/30/labels","id":1869312,"number":30,"title":"3.14","description":"","creator":{"login":"minggo","id":488203,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/488203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo","html_url":"https://github.com/minggo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":221,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-07-07T07:24:52Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T04:01:21Z","due_on":"2018-01-04T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2017-01-04T04:01:21Z"},"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-09-17T01:26:45Z","updated_at":"2016-10-05T05:27:04Z","closed_at":"2016-10-05T05:27:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- cocos2d-x version: 3.13.1\n- devices test on: macOS 10.12, macbook pro \n- developing environments\n  - NDK version:\n  - Xcode version: 8.0\n  - VS version:\n  - brower type and version:\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

If this is not straightforward then documentation may be necessary to note that if one wants to change a Sprite from one texture type to another may be required to update the GLProgramState manually after every setTexture call.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16569/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16568","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16568/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16568/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16568/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16568","id":176525755,"number":16568,"title":"Do

The inline keyword can be specified in the class declaration; **the result is the same.**\"_\n- According to [LLVM Coding Standards](http://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html#don-t-use-inline-when-defining-a-function-in-a-class-definition), LLVM does not recommend the use of `inline` keyword when defining a function in a class definition.\n\nSo we can get rid of some `inline` keywords. This will simplify the code for better readability and also keeps backward compatibility.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16562/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16561","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16561/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16561/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16561/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16561","id":176234089,"number":16561,"title":"Mac ,FPS drop from 60 to 30 on FullScreen .","user":{"login":"Kotaiba","id":3635272,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3635272?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kotaiba","html_url":"https://github.com/Kotaiba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kotaiba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kotaiba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kotaiba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kotaiba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kotaiba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kotaiba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kotaiba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kotaiba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kotaiba/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":231440087,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/labels/platform:mac","name":"platform:mac","color":"fbca04","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/milestones/37","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/milestone/37","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/milestones/37/labels","id":2471262,"number":37,"title":"next","description":"","creator":{"login":"minggo","id":488203,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/488203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo","html_url":"https://github.com/minggo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":59,"closed_issues":18,"state":"open","created_at":"2017-04-21T05:45:10Z","updated_at":"2017-09-29T01:21:47Z","due_on":"2017-10-27T07:00:00Z","closed_at":null},"comments":39,"created_at":"2016-09-11T09:18:41Z","updated_at":"2017-09-20T03:34:08Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- cocos2d-x version: 3.11.1\n- devices test on: Macbook Retina 15 , MAC OSX\n- developing environments\n  -
