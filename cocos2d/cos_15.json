Clicking on the right side of a color button doesn't call touch/lambda function (which outputs log info)\r\n5.2 Clicking on the left side of a color button calls lambda function and outputs log info\r\n\r\nReason of this bad behaviour:\r\n\r\nCalling setPositionX() to widget's descendant node to center inside ScrollView. setPositionX() effectively moves the node but touch handler doesn't notice it so touching reacts as if the node hadn't been moved.\r\n\r\n**NOTE** Calling setPositionX() to widget's itself does nothing, thus forcing me to call setPositionX() to node's descendant.\r\n\r\nSeems like this kind of problem has been around for a while. See this [post](http://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/t/how-to-add-buttons-to-a-scrollview-without-interfering-with-scrolling/31467/7). My code is based on it in an attempt to make it work for my real game. This helped finding out polishing how to reproduce the error but need badly to create a nice scroll menu, \r\n\r\n[HelloWorldScene.zip](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/files/1039109/HelloWorldScene.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17883/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17882","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17882/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17882/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17882/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17882","id":232212772,"number":17882,"title":"EventDispatcher::pauseEventListenersForTarget(Node* target, bool recursive/* = false */) not working","user":{"login":"hussain-sohaib","id":2145411,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2145411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussain-sohaib","html_url":"https://github.com/hussain-sohaib","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussain-sohaib/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussain-sohaib/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussain-sohaib/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussain-sohaib/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussain-sohaib/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussain-sohaib/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussain-sohaib/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussain-sohaib/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussain-sohaib/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":181000657,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/labels/module:core","name":"module:core","color":"207de5","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-05-30T10:46:25Z","updated_at":"2017-06-12T08:49:40Z","closed_at":"2017-06-12T07:43:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- cocos2d-x version: 3.15\r\n- devices test on: 6S Plus\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n   auto dispatcher = Director::getInstance()->getEventDispatcher();\r\n    auto listener = EventListenerTouchOneByOne::create();\r\n    listener->onTouchBegan = [](Touch* touch, Event* event){\r\n        auto sprite = event->getCurrentTarget();\r\n        Point pt = touch->getLocation();\r\n        Rect recTemp= sprite->boundingBox();\r\n        if(recTemp.containsPoint(pt )) {\r\n            //TOUCHED\r\n            log(\"touched\");\r\n        }\r\n//        log(\"not touched\");\r\n        return false;\r\n    };\r\n    /////////\r\n    dispatcher->addEventListenerWithSceneGraphPriority(listener, _tamara);\r\n\r\n _eventDispatcher->pauseEventListenersForTarget(_tamara,true);\r\n```\r\n\r\ntouched will still be written in console, when it should not.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4796","x-ratelimit-reset":"1506844633","x-github-request-id":"CC6A:0285:1053CD6:2003E00:59D09BD5","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=16>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=611>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=14>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"a4cb01fcd52c9da4c4296456dbc2dc4a\"","status":"200 OK"}}
