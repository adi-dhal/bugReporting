cocos2d-x version: v3.15\r\n- devices test on: Windows win32\r\n- developing environments\r\n   - NDK version: -\r\n   - Xcode version: -\r\n   - VS version: VS2017\r\n   - browser type and version: -\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Use the experimental audio engine (enable the USE_AUDIO_ENGINE define in AppDelegate.cpp).\r\n2. Close the game window manually (like clicking the X icon on the window).\r\n\r\nWhen AudioEngine::end() deletes the audio engine implementation instance via \"delete _audioEngineImpl;\", that calls the destructor \"AudioEngineImpl::~AudioEngineImpl\".  In that destructor it tries to do the following:\r\n\r\nif (_scheduler != nullptr)\r\n{\r\n    _scheduler->unschedule(CC_SCHEDULE_SELECTOR(AudioEngineImpl::update), this);\r\n}\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the _scheduler points to an instance that was freed when Director was freed, which happens before the AudioEngineImpl destructor is called.  Since AudioEngineImpl _scheduler is still pointing to a memory location that is no longer valid, it causes a crash in Scheduler::unschedule, since it tries to access freed memory.\r\n\r\nThe reason this happens is because Director::end() is called to do a cleanup from Application::run(), and it cleans up all memory associated with the Director instance before the AudioEngineImpl destructor is called.  \r\n\r\nThe destructor AppDelegate::~AppDelegate() is perhaps not the best place to call experimental::AudioEngine::end().  This exists in the C++ code template that is generated.  Where is the best place to put the experimental::AudioEngine::end() call?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17781","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17781/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17781/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17781/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/17781","id":226463477,"number":17781,"title":"fix
