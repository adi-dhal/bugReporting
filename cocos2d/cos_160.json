Video of Issue: https://youtu.be/t7EJp3Al_mc\nGithub repo to reproduce issue: https://github.com/jimrange/cocos2d-x-bugs/tree/cameraTouch\n\nThe Issue:\nTouching the screen on a location nowhere near a UIMenuItemImage can trigger the MenuItemImage, causing strange UI behavior that is difficult to debug. But I know know what is causing it...\n\nThere does not seem to be a way to make UI HUD elements such as the MenuItemImage only touchable by coordinates touched in the default camera. Or for specific alternative cameras.\n\nThis issue seems to be a result of the EventDispatcher::dispatchTouchEventToListeners cycling through all cameras on line 834 of CCEventDispatcher.cpp of Cocos2d-x 3.8 beta 0.\n\n e.g. touch the same coordinates of the MenuItemImage in the view of camera 1 and the button will be pressed. This creates a problem if world node has the same coordiantes as the hud node.\n\nMaybe a workaround is to not let my game world coordinates overlap with my HUD coordinates? e.g. position the hud at Rect(0,0,maxHudWidth,maxHudHeigth) and the game world at Rect(maxHudWidth,maxHudHeigth,worldWidth,worldHeight)? \n\nOr maybe for efficiency reasons and to fix the above issue, a filter could be applied somehow to only forward events from cameras that the API user selects.\n\nAnother way of describing the issue:\nThe issue is that that MenuItemImage by default (all Nodes do) has the CameraFlag::DEFAULT mask. This may stop the button from being visible in camera 1. However, if the rect that is defined for the button in the default camera is touched in camera 1, an event is dispatched as if the button were pressed in the defualt camera's view.\n\nThis issue can be demonstrated by this code by touching the HelloWorld.png sprite and observe that the button is being pressed and released.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13551/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13550","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13550/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13550/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13550/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/13550","id":102935832,"number":13550,"title":"[cpp-tests]Fixed title of test cases.","user":{"login":"WenhaiLin","id":5234286,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5234286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenhaiLin","html_url":"https://github.com/WenhaiLin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenhaiLin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenhaiLin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenhaiLin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenhaiLin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenhaiLin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenhaiLin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenhaiLin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenhaiLin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WenhaiLin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/milestones/21","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/milestone/21","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/milestones/21/labels","id":1080167,"number":21,"title":"v3.8","description":"This version is planned to only \"fix existing bugs\" and \"unfinished tasks\".\r\nWe need to improve the quality after a 3D rush in v3.6 and v3.7.
