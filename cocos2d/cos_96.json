thread safety (Android) https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/commit/d848292860421ffd475b6482818060b501380955\n\nThis is related to [my previous fix](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/14530) for android downloader that is not thread safe which may crash the app in certain circumstances\n### AssetManagerEx\n#### If the last task fails, it will stuck at `UPDATING` forever

not a bug) https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/commit/f3cd1298af0f16d67f93d9be8bfbdd3f22ce2796\n### HTTPAsyncConnection\n#### Crash when custom SSL certificate is set(iOS) https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/commit/200c9fda59f7a5fbece4ba4fa3a3729e38de6998\n\nThere is a redundant release of a CFArrayRef causing the object to be deallocated before NSURLConnectionLoader thread tries to release it, making it send a release message to an already deallocated object.\nThis also fixes a memory leak of SecCertificateRef\nSee
