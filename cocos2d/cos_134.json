@WenhaiLin  \nVery sorry to say that, I found my PR (https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/13206) has a fatal bug.\nIn the earlier version, the Win32InputBox is a modal dialog box, and it would block rendering, then I use a timer to do rendering in that PR. However, there is a fatal error, i.e., main loop of Director was re-entered.\nFor example, when the dialog box is not yet closed, and try to remove the EditBox in a schedule, it will crash.\n\nThis PR uses modaless dialog box, which avoids re-entry, and won't crash any more.\nI've done a series of tests, such as removing an EditBox in a schedule, in a Callback action, etc.\n\nPlease do some more test before merging.\nSorry trouble you.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14326","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14326/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14326/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14326/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14326","id":115282657,"number":14326,"title":"ParticleSystemQuad

lua有个非常严重的bug:     两个继承于Node的A与B       1. 在layer的init里  new A add A,  2.在onTouch时 new B    removeA  3.再次touch时 removeB     此时一定会挂在Node的析构函数这一句CCASSERT(!_running, \"Node still marked as running on node destruction! Was base class onExit() called in derived class onExit() implementations?\");\n\n我分析在step2    new B    与   removeA 这里，c++的内存分配上有问题，把A的内存分配给了B   导致了最终的奇怪crash \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14322/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14321","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14321/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14321/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14321/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/14321","id":115193954,"number":14321,"title":"Fix SocketIO crash on reconnect","user":{"login":"pandemosth","id":1736144,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1736144?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandemosth","html_url":"https://github.com/pandemosth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandemosth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandemosth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandemosth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandemosth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandemosth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandemosth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandemosth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandemosth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandemosth/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":203150684,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/labels/type:refine","name":"type:refine","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"minggo","id":488203,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/488203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo","html_url":"https://github.com/minggo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"minggo","id":488203,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/488203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo","html_url":"https://github.com/minggo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2015-11-05T02:14:29Z","updated_at":"2016-04-21T06:28:22Z","closed_at":"2016-04-21T06:28:21Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pulls/14321","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/14321","diff_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/14321.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/14321.patch"},"body":"Cleans up SIOClientImpl instance when websocket is unexpectedly closed.
