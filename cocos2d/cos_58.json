I had some troubles with matrix decomposition (quaternion part) ...\nI had a sprite transform i wanted to apply to another sprite using decomposition (without copying the nodeToWorldTransform directly).\nCould'nt make it right so after many breakpoints and logs I ended up looking at the  Mat4.decompose() function\n\nin this screen you can see the the wrongly oriented sprite over the sprite i want to get the transforms from :\n\n![quatwrong](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1607568/18666461/432a5f86-7f2c-11e6-9c6a-c32804deaaee.PNG)\n\nafter some research i have found this \nhttps://d3cw3dd2w32x2b.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/matrix-to-quat.pdf\n\nEnded spotting a difference in the implementation of cocos\n\ncocos:\n    if (trace > MATH_EPSILON)\n    {\n        float s = 0.5f / sqrt(trace);\n        rotation->w = 0.25f / s;\n        rotation->x = (yaxis.z - zaxis.y) \\* s;\n        rotation->y = (zaxis.x - xaxis.z) \\* s;\n        rotation->z = (xaxis.y
