when I was using cocos2d-x 3.2 the files were looked in Resources folder for windows applications. Hence, when I had a configuration file with game settings I could easily change some values and re-run the game and see what is changed. But now in cocos2d-x 3.5 the content of Resources is copied into `proj.win32/Debug.win32` during Pre-Link Event which in Visual Studio is setup as follows:\n\n`xcopy \"$(ProjectDir)..\\Resources\" \"$(OutDir)\" /D /E /I /F /Y`\n\nHence when I change .plist of .json file and re-run game without rebuilding it does not take effect - old resources are being used. The same is for graphics and shaders and it is very painful each time to delete from `proj.win32/Debug.win32` and also change a line in a source code to get it recompiled on run and copied the files into `proj.win32/Debug.win32`.
