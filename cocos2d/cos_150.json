x86_64\n我创建了个新的3.8版本的项目直接编译6s模拟器然后出现这个错误，用的是Xcode7 GM Seed版本\n我把项目的target Enable Bitcode 设置为No之后 真机上可以编译成功\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13828","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13828/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13828/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13828/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/13828","id":106490126,"number":13828,"title":"[ci
