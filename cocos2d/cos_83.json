in versions: cocos2d-x v3.11.1, and latest from v3 branch.\n\nThe crash is shown in the attached XCode screenshot.\n\n<img width=\"789\" alt=\"crash\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1736144/16079419/dcb8767e-3346-11e6-97a2-16e35599dd3d.png\">\n\nThe access violation happens if garbage collection take place. To reproduce, create a new js project using cocos command line, and in app.js, add the following before the end of the HelloWorldLayer constructor:\n\n```\n        this.sprite.runAction(\n            cc.sequence(\n                cc.rotateBy(2, 90).easing(cc.easeElasticInOut(0.5)),\n                cc.rotateBy(0.5, 90)\n            ).repeatForever()\n        );\n\n        cc.sys.garbageCollect();\n```\n\nThis crashes if easing function called, otherwise it does not.\n\nNote, this is a trivial example to show the issue. This is causing crashes all over our game which is being upgraded from v3.9 to v3.11 (works fine on v3.9). For example, garbage collection is requested whenever a scene transition finishes, so any actions with easing that are created within the incoming scene will cause this crash.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15851/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15850","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15850/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15850/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15850/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/15850","id":160390861,"number":15850,"title":"[ci
