These functions are synchronous, and performed on the main thread. This can be detrimental to performance. It can cause hitching and frame drops while loading data from the filesystem.\r\n\r\nI suggest that we create asynchronous versions of these functions, that each take a callback. The operation will be completed off thread, and then call the callback on the main thread once complete. \r\n\r\nI think the best mechanism for managing the threading is to iterate on CCThreadPool, and pull that feature out of experimental, and bring it into the engine proper. \r\n\r\nI have been iterating on CCThreadPool, and have an iteration I would like to share for consideration. It can be found here: https://github.com/DavidDeSimone/cocos2d-x/blob/async-file-utils/cocos/platform/CCThreadPool.cpp. I have made major changes to this file that I would be happy to discuss/iterate on with other developers involved. \r\n\r\nI'd be curious what @dumganhar thinks of all of this.
