have some image views in ccui.HBox (for example, this bug works with all layout types). \nSome of them has scale != 1. \nAnd their position on screen is like they doesn't have scale transformation.\n![2015-11-11 10 15 13](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10628482/11085978/862bee2e-885d-11e5-87d3-f4e94f9b43cf.png)\n(Code examples are in JS, but it reproduces both in C++ ant JS versions)\n\n``` javascript\nvar HelloWorldLayer = ccui.Layout.extend({\n    ctor:function () {\n        this._super();\n\n        this.setContentSize(cc.director.getWinSize());\n\n        var layout = new ccui.HBox();\n\n        var sprite1 = new ccui.ImageView(res.HelloWorld_png);\n\n        var parameter = new ccui.LinearLayoutParameter();\n        parameter.setGravity(ccui.LinearLayoutParameter.BOTTOM);\n\n        sprite1.setLayoutParameter(parameter);\n\n        var sprite2 = sprite1.clone();\n        sprite2.setScale(0.5);\n\n        sprite2.setLayoutParameter(parameter.clone());\n\n        layout.addChild(sprite1);\n        layout.addChild(sprite2);\n\n        layout.setContentSize(sprite1.width + sprite2.width, sprite1.height);\n\n        this.addChild(layout);\n    }\n});\n```\n\nIs it a but or a feature(layout manager must work like this and i must consider this behavior in my code)?\n\nIf it is a bug, an obvious solution is to apply transform(node to parent) to content size of child widgets in **doLayout** method of LayoutManager's like this(example in JS version, but it can be applied to C++ version):\n\n``` javascript\n_doLayout: function(layout)\n{\n.....\n     if (layoutParameter)\n     {\n               .....\n              var ap = child.getAnchorPoint();\n              var cs = cc.sizeApplyAffineTransform(child.getContentSize(),child.getNodeToParentTransform());\n              var finalPosX = leftBoundary + (ap.x * cs.width);\n      .............\n}\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4996","x-ratelimit-reset":"1506848236","x-github-request-id":"B45C:110B:10F9968:3D8DF0E:59D09FEF","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=133>;
