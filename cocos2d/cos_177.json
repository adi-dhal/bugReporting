on cocos2d-x v3.6. What is the recommended/supported way to create scenes - specifically when using replaceScene()? \n\nI used to use the `director->replaceScene(Myscene::createScene())` way from the template, but later when switching to RapidGame (you can find here on Github) it seems that the create() method was incompatible (it crashed in onExit for me) so I changed to the recommended way in RapidGame which is to use `director->replaceScene(new Myscene)` - now I'm worrying about memory issues here because I guess that cocos2d-x has no way of knowing if the dev used new, so it cannot release that memory on its own... (and in fact I am seeing that the destructor is not actually called on my scenes which currently uses this method)\n\nWell looking at the cpp HelloWorld template in 3.6/3.7 it still looks like `director->replaceScene(Myscene::createScene())` **is** the correct way... and that Myscene should have a `static cocos2d::Scene* createScene();` as well as `CREATE_FUNC(Myscene);` defined.

confirm?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13035/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13034","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13034/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13034/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13034/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/13034","id":97391199,"number":13034,"title":"[AUTO][ci
