在CCRef里面通过CC_REF_LEAK_DETECTION跟踪Ref对象生命周期，由于现在Image是继承自Ref，在TextureCache里面通过线程加载时就有可能导致__refAllocationList数据污染。\n2. FileUtils的fullPathForFilename也是一样在TextureCache的loadImage线程里面操作_fullPathCache这个容器。\n3. TextureCache的loadImage里面_textures.find(asyncStruct->filename);操作也是不安全的\n\n问题1,确认过是会crash的\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12965/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12964","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12964/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12964/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12964/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/12964","id":96676819,"number":12964,"title":"improves
