It appears that if margin is set to -10 just after button create we get partial Button \"clipping\" if we later update the margin to >= 0. \n\nWhile we could change how we position the buttons and which widgets we use the issue arises when we have a VBox with Button as children and we change the margins from -20 to 0 in order to make the buttons only partially visible.\n\nNotes:\n- I have no idea yet if clipping is the culprit, but the issue goes away when we disable CULLING\n- unsure if it's clipping, Scale9Sprite draw path, or something else?\n## Example\n\nThis is a screen shot after we have moved the two top buttons setting initially with -20 Left Margin and later updating the Left Margin to 0.

The touch coordinates are always scaled and cropped per the design resolution settings and can be defined as VisibleRect.\n\n```\nSize visibleSize = Director::getInstance()->getVisibleSize();\nVec2
