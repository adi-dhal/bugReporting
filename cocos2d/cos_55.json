Originally I was using cocos2d-js 3.9, but already looked at 3.13 source code. If any decompression error occurs, it just deletes downloaded zip file, temp manifest and so on. So after a restart, you'll get a game with corrupted/incomplete assets, incremented version and no obvious way to even detect this.\n\nI've temporary fixed this in bundled LoaderScene by storing a flag into local storage about starting/successfully finishing update procedure and exposed to JSB a method to delete all downloaded content in case of any failure, so AssetsManager will try to download everything again.\n\nBtw, because all decompressing is happening as a final step and there is no information about progress of this process, on \"slow\" devices this process can take up to several minutes (we have ~200Mb images) without any visual feedback to the

to Reproduce:\n1.  Integrate something able to start new activity from your app (we are currently using sdkbox iap, play, appodeal that starts new activity),\n2.  Run/Compile,Install,Start your app\n3.  When app start start new activity (ex in my case. play video for appodeal, show achievements, ...)\n4.  Return to device home without close app\n5.  Re-open app using icon\n6.  Note that activity has been stopped\n\nThe problem seems to be related to android issues reported in this answer: _http://stackoverflow.com/a/16447508_\n\nI managed to solve with answer workaround, but unfortunately i'm totally inexperienced in android activities. Note that with these steps the issue will only be present first time you install and launch the app, if you restart this doesn't happen. There are others methods for this to happen as for example launch the app from play store, return on device home without close, clicking app icon.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16687/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16686","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16686/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16686/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16686/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/16686","id":182493375,"number":16686,"title":"fixed cpp-tests ClickAndMoveTestCase bug","user":{"login":"AbnerZhou","id":16464038,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/16464038?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbnerZhou","html_url":"https://github.com/AbnerZhou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbnerZhou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbnerZhou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbnerZhou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbnerZhou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbnerZhou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbnerZhou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbnerZhou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbnerZhou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbnerZhou/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-10-12T10:44:20Z","updated_at":"2017-02-10T06:02:59Z","closed_at":"2017-02-10T06:02:59Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pulls/16686","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/16686","diff_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/16686.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/16686.patch"},"body":"The sprite (Grossini) need't move when touch position is the same as sprite's (Grossini) position.\nAnd when \"a\" equal 0,  \"atanf(o / a)\" will have problem.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16685","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16685/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16685/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16685/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16685","id":182477806,"number":16685,"title":"CCClippingNode causes bad performance on windows phone 8.1/ windows 10 mobile device","user":{"login":"flowerfx","id":16619037,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/16619037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flowerfx","html_url":"https://github.com/flowerfx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flowerfx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flowerfx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flowerfx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flowerfx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flowerfx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flowerfx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flowerfx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flowerfx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flowerfx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2016-10-12T09:30:09Z","updated_at":"2017-02-15T08:54:22Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- cocos2d-x version: 3.13.1\n- devices test on: Lumia 640XL windows 10 mobile\n- developing environments\n  - NDK version:\n  - Xcode version:\n  - VS version: 2015 community \n  - browser type and version:\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
