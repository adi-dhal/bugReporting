data);\r\n\r\n        memset(data, 0, dataLen);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI understand you want the newly RT to be clean ... but as for some reasons it is advised to do a glClear() after a RT is binded (for Tiled Architecture on mobile)... and that the Render Texture is fully rendered into ... and that glTexImage2D() accept null pointers as data ... \r\n\r\ni was wondering if it could become a configurable thing not to allocate and do the memset ?\r\n\r\nWe tried this option and we had quit a lot of gain .... talking about 10 fps gain for about 40 renders in 40 different RTs , which is what we want.\r\n\r\nMaybe there is something I overlooked and you have a good reason to do that ... but I'd like your advise on that point.\r\n\r\nThanks for your work and feed
