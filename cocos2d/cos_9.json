One way could be creating a whole new class based on `GLViewImpl` that passes those events to both: `dear imgui` and the `EventDispatcher` but doing that will prompt many unnecessary changes, unnecessary copy-paste that will affect maintainability and that can be avoided with just this pull request.\r\n\r\nWith this change it's easy to rewire the glfw events [like this](https://github.com/Rubonnek/cocos2d-x-imgui/blob/master/Classes/CCImGui/ImGuiManager.cpp#L216-L223) to [pass raw glfw events to both](https://github.com/Rubonnek/cocos2d-x-imgui/blob/master/Classes/CCImGui/ImGuiManager.cpp#L225-L247) `EventDispatcher` and `dear imgui`.\r\n\r\nIn the future, should cocos2d-x support webassembly, it will also allow developers to use their same in-game editor based on `dear imgui` (or any other UI library like [nuklear](https://github.com/vurtun/nuklear)) on the web too since there are currently examples of running `dear imgui` alone on the web.
