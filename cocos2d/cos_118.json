textures = _fontAtlas->getTextures();这行代码下面添加以下代码：\nfor (auto index = 0; index < _batchNodes.size() && index < textures.size(); ++index)\n    {\n        auto batchNode = _batchNodes[index];\n        batchNode->setTexture(textures.at(index));\n    }\n就没有问题了。\n\n顺带一提就是，低版本的CCLabel使用阴影的enableOutline使用了blurRadius那个默认参数的时候会导致特别卡，具体是因为他使用了setColor这个及其低效的函数，可以把那个参数传一个大于0的值，或者参照新版本改下代码就不会卡了。
