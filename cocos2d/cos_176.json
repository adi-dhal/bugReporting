callback调用，cobj = (cocos2d::Ref*)tolua_tousertype(tolua_S,1,0); cobj返回null\n5. 崩溃\n这个脚本程序员很常见的错误，如果一个不小心，release版本就不明不白的就挂了。\n我宁愿要一个slow and

C++函数异常检查也可以。\n@pandamicro\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13072/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13071","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13071/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13071/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13071/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/13071","id":97832067,"number":13071,"title":"Fixing

creating a new JS project, a sample HelloWorldScene is created and that scene creates a HelloWorldLayer. From a hierarchical standpoint this makes a lot of sense: the layer is a child of the scene so the scene creates the layer.\n\nIn the C++ project this is not the case. The layer creates the scene which puts an odd dependency on the layer which should not be there in my opinion.\n\nCould the C++ sample project be changed so it looks more like the JS sample project? I personally find the JS version a lot easier to build apps upon.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13070/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13069","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13069/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13069/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13069/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/13069","id":97757755,"number":13069,"title":"Fixed

think this may not be the right place to ask questions, but I've searched all over the internet to no avail. I just want to check for touch events on Sprites or DrawNodes, but when I bind the listener and run the application, the function gets called no matter where I click. This is the last place i'm looking for a solution to this problem, It's driving me crazy! -_-'\n\nauto sprite = Sprite::create(\"sprite.png\");\n    sprite->setPosition(Vec2(100, 100));\n\n```\nauto listener2 = EventListenerTouchOneByOne::create();\nlistener2->setSwallowTouches(true);\n\n// trigger when you push down\nlistener2->onTouchBegan = [](Touch* touch, Event* event){\n    // your code\n    log(\"2-Touch started: %s\", event->getCurrentTarget()->getName().c_str());\n    return true; // if you are consuming it\n};\n\n// trigger when moving touch\nlistener2->onTouchMoved = [](Touch* touch, Event* event){\n    log(\"2-Touch moved: %s\", event->getCurrentTarget()->getName().c_str());\n    // your code\n};\n\n// trigger when you let up\nlistener2->onTouchEnded = [=](Touch* touch, Event* event){\n    log(\"2-Touch end: %s\", event->getCurrentTarget()->getName().c_str());\n    // your code\n};\n\n// Add listener\nsprite->getEventDispatcher()->addEventListenerWithSceneGraphPriority(listener2, sprite);\n\naddChild(sprite);\n```\n\nNo matter where I touch/click on the screen, I always get a bunch of \"\"2-Touch ....\" on the console. What is wrong with my code?! \nThanks.\n\nBTW, I'm using version 3.6\n\n**EDIT**: It looks like I have to check if `touch->getLocation()` belongs to `event->getCurrentTarget()->getBoundingBox()`. I thought that the function would be called only once and for the corresponding node (touched one). It looks like this callback is called for every node and I have to filter to match the node that was clicked. Correct me if I'm wrong. Thanks anyways.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13046","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13046/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13046/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13046/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13046","id":97504115,"number":13046,"title":"3.7版本的CC_ENABLE_BULLET_INTEGRATION宏的继承问题","user":{"login":"acros","id":1189846,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1189846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acros","html_url":"https://github.com/acros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acros/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"yangws","id":488183,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/488183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangws","html_url":"https://github.com/yangws","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangws/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangws/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangws/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangws/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangws/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangws/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangws/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangws/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangws/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"yangws","id":488183,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/488183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangws","html_url":"https://github.com/yangws","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangws/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangws/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangws/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangws/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangws/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangws/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangws/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangws/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangws/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-07-27T16:34:32Z","updated_at":"2015-07-28T02:01:53Z","closed_at":"2015-07-28T02:01:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"CC_ENABLE_BULLET_INTEGRATION=1在cocos2d-x DLL中启用，但是继承项目中并没有添加这个宏，导致主项目引用DLL时，实际编译头文件忽略了 Physics3DWorld\\* 和 Camera*两个指针，DLL外进行Scene类内寻址_Physics3DWorld成员之后的变量全部出错。\n\n另外，Scene还重定义覆盖了Node中的 PhysicsWorld\\* _physicsWorld成员。\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13046/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4952","x-ratelimit-reset":"1506848236","x-github-request-id":"8E3A:110B:10FE264:3D9E453:59D0A194","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=177>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=611>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=175>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"13ab9d1ff8577f20041ca7c5aba7fe7e\"","status":"200 OK"}}
