下载完```project.manifest```文件后触发一个新事件，这个事件里包含总需下载多少字节，让用户决定是否下载这个更新，如果决定下载后再调用```AssetsManagerEx::startUpdate()```，而不是下载完后立刻就调用。\r\n\r\n2. 在发送```UPDATE_PROGRESSION```事件的时候提供```下载了多少字节```，```总共有多少字节需要下载```。\r\n3. 在```AssetsManagerEx```新增的几个函数需导出到js/lua 里使用\r\n  ```getMaxConcurrentTask```, ```setMaxConcurrentTask```,
