I'm getting this warning message with the recent build and Xcode 7.3.1 since v3.13.\n\n```\ncocos/2d/CCNode.cpp:259:5: '_setLocalZOrder' is deprecated\ncocos/2d/CCNode.cpp:1136:12: '_setLocalZOrder' is deprecated\ncocos/2d/CCNode.cpp:1144:12: '_setLocalZOrder' is deprecated\n```\n\n`_setLocalZOrder()` has been deprecated two years ago (since commit https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/commit/31c508ef6de537a55ae73cffc52077f5436dc584), so we should not use it in a core feature of the engine such as `cocos2d::Node`.\n\nThis pull request does the following to prevent the warnings:\n- Add a new private member function `setLocalZOrderHelper()` instead of `_setLocalZOrder()`\n- Replace `_setLocalZOrder()` with `setLocalZOrderHelper()`\n- Improve & cleanup documentation comments\n\nThank you for your time!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16470/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4748","x-ratelimit-reset":"1506844633","x-github-request-id":"AF02:110A:24B6333:411B80D:59D09D6A","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=63>;
