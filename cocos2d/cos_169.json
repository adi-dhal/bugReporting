PR fixed issue: \nhttps://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13147\n\nThis PR also fixed issue:\n\nhttps://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/9572\n\nFor the new EditBox:\n1. Added a ResizeLayout for updating layout when soft keyboard is shown.\n   This is because some Android devices won't refresh the view and when\n   the view is panned, the native EditText will turn black. This is really\n   a hack, but it works for many Android devices from 2.3 to 5.0.\n   When keyboard is beginning to show, the ResizeLayout's doLayout\n   method will be called 24 frames per second. Once the keyboard is closed,\n   or the user begins to input, the doLayout method will be disabled.\n2. EditText is working in a different UI thread, so all the data\n   are passed to GL thread via callbacks in UI thead.\n3. It also overrides onKeyDown method in Cocos2dxEditBox.\n   When the EditText got the focus, users could press back key to exit\n   the game. This behavior is not allowed. We give developer the choice to\n   handle back key event manually.\n4. It also add `static Rect convertBoundingBoxToScreen(Node* node);` in ui::Helper class to remove redundant code. And this function is very useful for synchronizing native control transform with OpenGL transform.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13272","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13272/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13272/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13272/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/13272","id":99615848,"number":13272,"title":"fixed
