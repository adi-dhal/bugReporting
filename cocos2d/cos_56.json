Skybox implementation didn't correctly account for the camera's field of view and aspect ratio. This\nshowed particularly badly if the camera was pointed down and rotated, which produced a deformation\nof the image as it rotated. On of these commits corrects that.\n\nAlso, while analysing this, it was noticed that the skybox implementation was using an unnecessarily\ncomplicated mesh with faces that were never rendered. That is corrected in one of the other commits.\n\nThe one other commit removes all setScale applied to skyboxes from the test code. The skybox\nimplementation makes no use of the MVP transform and hence is uneffected by scaling

code:\n\n`auto originalSize = CC_SIZE_POINTS_TO_PIXELS(_originalSize);\nif (_isPatch9)\n{\n    originalSize = Size(originalSize.width - 2, originalSize.height-2);\n}`\n\nHere we are decreasing size for 2 pixels in width and height.\n\nAnd there are another part of code where we also apply magic number two (2) but on size variable fields that not in pixel coordinates but on design resolution coordinates, see `Scale9Sprite::updateWithSprite`:\n\n`if(this->_isPatch9)\n  {\n     size.width = size.width - 2;\n     size.height = size.height - 2;\n  }\n  this->setContentSize(size);\n`\nI assume
