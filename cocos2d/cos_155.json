All scenes were built using cocos studio.\n The issue is that I've enemies coming from off screen on the top of the screen, they are moving across the top HUD bar where the player number of lives, resources, score, etc are. When there are too many enemies they cover the whole HUD bar.\n Trying to fix the issue I tried to set the global z order of all sprites and widgets that make the top HUD bar. However, for the sprite the global z order work fine but the any ui::widget component it doesn't. The widget doesn't render on top of the sprites as expected. I though they were disappearing, then I set the sprites visible to false and I saw them. Basically, they are being rendered behind the sprites. \n It doesn't matter what z order I set, like 100 to the sprites and 150 to the labels, loadingbar, they just don't render properly.\n I've successfully reproduced the issue on v3.7 in a small project. I put 1 sprite and 1 label on the screen and on the code I set their global z order, the sprite is rendered on top of the label.\n\n```\n  auto rootNode = CSLoader::createNode(\"MainScene.csb\");\n\n    addChild(rootNode);\n\n\n    auto spaceship1 = static_cast<cocos2d::Sprite*>(rootNode->getChildByName(\"mycra_ori_1\"));\n    if(spaceship1!=nullptr){\n        cout << \"spaceship1 found it\" << endl;\n    }\n    spaceship1->setGlobalZOrder(100);\n    auto resourcesText = static_cast<cocos2d::ui::Text*>(rootNode->getChildByName(\"Text_1\"));\n    if(resourcesText!=nullptr){\n        cout << \"resourcesText found it\" << endl;\n    }\n    resourcesText->setGlobalZOrder(140);\n```\n\nThis is the scene in Cocos Studio.\n![screen shot 2015-09-05 at 00 13 33](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13041480/9685679/1debbee0-5363-11e5-9a93-7dc8cbd05fe5.png)\n\nThis is the output on the ios simulator.\n![screen shot 2015-09-05 at 00 15 41](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13041480/9685707/4b45078e-5363-11e5-936f-1f9c139fb986.png)\n\nI appreciate any help and a confirmation whether this is really a bug. I've a problem that I may have to re-do all my scenes manually because this issue. I hope I don't have too... thank you\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13682/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13681","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13681/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13681/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13681/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13681","id":104889703,"number":13681,"title":"android:sharedUserId on Manifest Causes Crash on Galaxy Edge+ and Note 5","user":{"login":"ermanhaskan","id":11976403,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11976403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ermanhaskan","html_url":"https://github.com/ermanhaskan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ermanhaskan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ermanhaskan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ermanhaskan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ermanhaskan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ermanhaskan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ermanhaskan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ermanhaskan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ermanhaskan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ermanhaskan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-09-04T13:18:52Z","updated_at":"2016-07-04T07:15:13Z","closed_at":"2016-07-04T07:15:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello\n\nAfter very long hours of struggle I found out that Cocos2d-x Applications crash on Galaxy Edge+ and Note 5 if they have a android:sharedUserId value on the manifest and the value is same with the package name.

Create a new game with the latest version of cocos. And add a android:sharedUserId parameter to the <manifest> tag with a value same as the package game.

  \n    auto tileProperties = map->getPropertiesForGID(gid).asValueMap();\n\n    if (tileProperties.find(\"blank\") == tileProperties.end()){\n        isOnFloor = true;\n        floorY = tileY * mapTileSize.height;\n    }\n    else{\n        isOnFloor = false;\n        floorY = 0;\n    }\n```\n\nsorry for bad english ;)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13680/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13679","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13679/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13679/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13679/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13679","id":104760978,"number":13679,"title":"TMX artifacts.","user":{"login":"VictorJL","id":8097385,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8097385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorJL","html_url":"https://github.com/VictorJL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorJL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorJL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorJL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorJL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorJL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorJL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorJL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorJL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VictorJL/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2015-09-03T19:05:09Z","updated_at":"2015-09-07T21:26:24Z","closed_at":"2015-09-07T21:26:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When loading a TMX map file this is what happens: \n\n![artifact_a](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8097385/9667922/ecac798c-523b-11e5-9dd2-529e67eb68dd.PNG)\n![artifacts_b](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8097385/9667923/ecaf9928-523b-11e5-91ca-68b069505da6.PNG)\n![artifacts_c](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8097385/9667924/eceee042-523b-11e5-9287-fd0bde205cda.PNG)\n\nThe tileset has padding and margin:\n\n![level_sheriffman_bank](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8097385/9667958/1326ef20-523c-11e5-87f2-4b78e477467e.png)\n\nThis is the tmx map file: \nhttps://gist.github.com/VictorJL/d6652c55d6eeb6ca1e79\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13679/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13678","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13678/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13678/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13678/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13678","id":104731809,"number":13678,"title":"ccConfig.h CC_CONSTRUCTOR_ACCESS is public","user":{"login":"Almax27","id":1354634,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1354634?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Almax27","html_url":"https://github.com/Almax27","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Almax27/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Almax27/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Almax27/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Almax27/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Almax27/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Almax27/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Almax27/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Almax27/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Almax27/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2015-09-03T16:15:38Z","updated_at":"2015-11-14T15:40:05Z","closed_at":"2015-11-14T15:40:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"CC_CONSTRUCTOR_ACCESS comment says default is 'protected', as it should be given the create() paradigm.
