issue: #10487 \nrelate pr: #13105 \n\n**Temporary solution:**\n#13105 is a temporary remedy. we wanna to get a balance between bug and performance. so we choose  to check model view matrix dirty for default camera preferentially and ignore user's cameras.\n\n**Now the result is:**\n- For default camera, bug is fixed, performance almost the same with before.\n- For user's cameras, bug is fixed, but get performance loss.\n\n**What we need to do?**\n- Check model view dirty for all nodes and cameras.\n- Multiple cameras for a node, the difficulty is:\n  - How to manage cameras' dirty? \n  - How to update cameras' dirty?\n  - How to optimize search algorithm to reduce performance loss?\n\n**Suggestion**\nIf you get confuse with auto-culling function, here are something you need to know. (for Sprite & Label)\n- CC_USE_CULLING is a precompiled macro instead of hard coding, means that it's not a 100% optimization. The right way is enable/disable it in the appropriate environment.\n- If ensure all of the Sprite/Label inside of the screen, disable auto-culling function.\n- If a lot of Sprite/Label outside of screen, enable auto-culling function.\n- If ensure camera is a static object, no needs to apply #13105.\n- Detailed performance comparision can be found via #10487.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13109/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13108","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13108/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13108/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13108/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/13108","id":98099702,"number":13108,"title":"improve
