Description of Bug\n//-------------------\n// Sometimes the physics sprites are not setup/initialized properly when\n// getPhysicsWorld()->setAutoStep(false) is used.\n// e.g. a manual physics step is used instead of the auto phyiscs step.\n\n// When using manual step for the integrated physics e.g. getPhysicsWorld()->setAutoStep(false) and\n// getPhysicsWorld()->step(dt) is manually called in an update loop, there seems to be physics\n// and sprite initialization issues.\n//\n// If a method is scheduled from inside of a callback, and that method replaces the current scene,\n// for some reason the initialization of Physics objects, sprites, etc do not work as expected (when\n// using manual physics step).\n//\n// When the button callback directly calls the replace scene, the strange behavior does occur, but\n// it occurs less often than when a method is scheduled inside of the callback and the schedduled\n// method replaces the scene.\n//\n// I think that the HttpClient also schedules methods from the asyc completion to try to get back on\n// the main thread. It was the use of HttpClient where I first noticed this issue.\n\n//----------------------\n// Steps to Recreate Bug\n//----------------------\n// To recreate the issue:\n// Clone the github repo located at: https://github.com/jimrange/cocos2dxPhysicsBug/tree/manualStep12691\n// View Video of the behavior: https://youtu.be/WGzviqqClRo\n// In HelloWorld.cpp, enable USE_PHYSICS_MANUAL_STEP and\n// enable SCHEDULE_SELECTOR_IN_MENU_CALLBACK below.\n// Then run the app and press the button in the lower right corner to replace the scene.\n#define USE_PHYSICS_MANUAL_STEP 1\n#define SCHEDULE_SELECTOR_IN_MENU_CALLBACK 1\n\n//----------------------------\n// Work-around Fix (temporary)\n//----------------------------\n// A hack work-around to fix the initialization issue described above is to delay calling\n// getPhysicsWorld()->setAutoStep(false) and delay the manual calling of getPhysicsWorld()->step(dt).\n#define DELAY_CHANGING_TO_MANUAL_PHYSICS_STEP 1\n\n\n//----------------------------\n// Worth looking into this\n//------------------------\n// Forcing the replace scene to the main thread seems to fix the issue. However, the initial setup on\n// launch still seems to have unexpected behavior when using a manual physics step.\n// To enable FORCE_REPLACE_SCENE_TO_MAIN_THREAD, you must also rename this file to HelloWorldScene.mm.\n#define FORCE_REPLACE_SCENE_TO_MAIN_THREAD 0\n\n// Calling the setup from the init method or from the onEneter did not seem to make a difference\n// regarding this bug.\n#define CALL_SETUP_IN_ON_ENTER 0\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12691/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12690","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12690/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12690/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12690/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/12690","id":93214266,"number":12690,"title":"add
