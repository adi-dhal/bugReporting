Try to compile it: `cocos compile -p web -m release`\n\nResult:\n\n```\nBuildfile: /tmp/test/publish/html5/build.xml\n\nBUILD FAILED\n/tmp/test/publish/html5/build.xml:5: taskdef class com.google.javascript.jscomp.ant.CompileTask cannot be found\n using the classloader AntClassLoader[]\n\nTotal time: 0 seconds\nError running command, return code: 1.\n```\n\nLooking at `build.xml` I can find this line:\n\n```\n    <taskdef name=\"jscomp\" classname=\"com.google.javascript.jscomp.ant.CompileTask\"\n             classpath=\"/home/ntrrgc/Programas/cocos2d-x/tools/cocos2d-console/plugins/plugin_compile/build_web/bin/compiler-1.7.jar\"/>\n```\n\nIt fails because `tools/cocos2d-console/plugins/plugin_compile/build_web/bin/compiler-1.7.jar` does not exist in the cocos2d-x directory (the `build_web/bin` directory does not exist at all). \n\nI guess that file is the closure compiler, which should be automatically downloaded at some point. Am I missing something?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16382/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16381","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16381/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16381/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16381/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16381","id":171665051,"number":16381,"title":"vs2013 compile cocos2d-x2.x error C2659: “=”: ","user":{"login":"zhenqicai","id":20643420,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/20643420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenqicai","html_url":"https://github.com/zhenqicai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenqicai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenqicai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenqicai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenqicai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenqicai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenqicai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenqicai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenqicai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenqicai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":231439454,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/labels/platform:win32","name":"platform:win32","color":"fbca04","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-08-17T14:00:10Z","updated_at":"2016-08-22T02:48:27Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- cocos2d-x version:cocos2d-x2.2.2\n- devices test on:windows8.1 win32\n- developing environments\n  -
