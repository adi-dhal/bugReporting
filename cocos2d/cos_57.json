HelloWorld::init() ... add the following ... (leave create as it comes from the template)\n   auto tileMap1 = TMXTiledMap::create(\"Tiled/map_1.tmx\");\n   auto layer1     = tileMap1->getLayer(\"Kachelebene 1\");\n   Size  winSize   = Director::getInstance()->getWinSize();\n   float scale     = Director::getInstance()->getContentScaleFactor();\n   layer1->setPosition(winSize.width / 2 - layer1->getContentSize().width + \n   tileMap1->getTileSize().width / scale / 4 - 2, winSize.height / 2 - layer1->getContentSize().height - 2);\n   this->addChild(layer1);\n   \n   int x, y;\n   auto size = layer1->getLayerSize();\n   \n   for (x=0; x<size.width; x++)\n   {\n       for (y=0; y<size.height; y++)\n       {\n           auto eventListener = EventListenerTouchOneByOne::create();\n           eventListener->onTouchBegan = CC_CALLBACK_2(HelloWorld::onTouchBeganTile, this);\n           this->getEventDispatcher()->addEventListenerWithSceneGraphPriority(eventListener, layer1->tileAt(Vec2(x, y)));\n           s->initWithFormat(\"1%d%d\", x, y);\n           layer1->tileAt(Vec2(x, y))->setName(s->getCString());\n       }\n   }\n2.  add function ...\n   bool HelloWorld::onTouchBeganTile(Touch _touch, Event *event)\n   {\n   auto target = static_cast<Sprite_>(event->getCurrentTarget());\n   Point locationInNode = target->convertToNodeSpace(touch->getLocation());\n   Size s = target->getContentSize();\n   Rect rect = Rect(s.width \\* 0.1, s.height \\* 0.1, s.width \\* 0.8, s.height \\* 0.8);\n   \n   if (rect.containsPoint(locationInNode))\n   {\n       target->setOpacity(target->getOpacity() ^ 0xa5);\n       return true;\n   }\n   return true;\n   }\n3. in the HelloWorld header add ...\n   \n   bool onTouchBeganTile(Touch *touch, Event *event);\n\nNow if I didn't miss something here you should be able to click on a tile of the map and it should change its opacity. So far so good.\n1. Now add the following to HelloWorld:init() ...\n   \n   srand (time(NULL));\n   this->setRotation3D(Vec3(rand()%360, rand()%360, rand()%360));\n\nNow the whole thing is 3D rotated after program start. I observed that now my mouse clicks don't switch the opacity of the tile (sprite) which I click. It rather seems to hit the tile that would have been at the location of the click if I never had rotated the layer. Actually my real program has more than one map (layer) and there the behavior is even more complicated when I rotate different maps (layers) under different angles. I may safely say that after rotation the event does not return the click target that I was clicking on ... Hope I didn't do something stupid and waste your time.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16638/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16637","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16637/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16637/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16637/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/16637","id":180498056,"number":16637,"title":"Adding 'addImageAsyncImmediate' to CCTextureCache.

This is designed to mimic the architecture of HttpClient::sendImmediate. \n\nThis feature should be almost entirely additive, and have minimal impact to users who do not opt-in to this new

cocos2d-x version: 3.13.1\r\n\r\nI use cocos2dx with **only** Box2D.\r\n\r\nSo I disabled default use of `chipmunk, bullet, recast` via adding following configuration options to my project `CMakeLists.txt`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSET( USE_SOURCES_EXTERNAL ON CACHE BOOL \"Use some libraries from cocos2dx externals\" )\r\nSET( USE_CHIPMUNK OFF CACHE BOOL \"Turn off default ChipMunk (2D physics)\" )\r\nSET( USE_BULLET OFF CACHE BOOL \"Turn off Bullet (3d physics)\" )\r\nSET( USE_RECAST OFF CACHE BOOL \"Turn off Recast (3d pathfinding)\" )\r\nSET( USE_BOX2D ON CACHE BOOL \"Turn on Box2D for 2D physics\" )\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\ncocos2dx library compiling is OK.\r\nmy project compiling is OK.\r\n\r\nBut, when I try to use default camera object from any scene, I got SEGFAULT.\r\n\r\n```\r\nauto camera = cocos2d::Director::getInstance()->getRunningScene()->getDefaultCamera();\r\nauto position = camera->getPosition();\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy \"small\" investigation (8 hrs) lead me to `cocos2d::Node` (parent class of`cocos2d::Scene`).\r\n\r\nI found out that there is a block of code, covered with `#ifdef CC_USE_PHYSICS`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#if CC_USE_PHYSICS\r\n    PhysicsBody* _physicsBody; \r\n    ...\r\n#endif\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause `USE_CHIPMUNK` is set to `OFF` in my configuration, cocos2dx cmake module defines `CC_USE_PHYSICS` to `0`, **add_definitions(-DCC_USE_PHYSICS=0)** (see `cmake\\Modules\\SetCompilerOptions.cmake`):\r\n\r\n```\r\n    # definitions for chipmunk\r\n    if (USE_CHIPMUNK)\r\n        add_definitions(-DCC_ENABLE_CHIPMUNK_INTEGRATION=1)\r\n        if (IOS OR MACOSX)\r\n            # without this chipmunk will try to use apple defined geometry types, that conflicts with cocos\r\n            add_definitions(-DCP_USE_CGPOINTS=0)\r\n        endif()\r\n    else()\r\n        add_definitions(-DCC_USE_PHYSICS=0)\r\n    endif()\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo cocos2d library is compiled with `CC_USE_PHYSICS=0` and with absent field `_physicsBody` in `cocos2d::Node` class definition. \r\n\r\nMy project compiles with undefined CC_USE_PHYSICS.\r\n(BTW I don't think it's good practice to add any library related definitions to my project.)\r\n\r\nLet's look into `cocos/base/ccConfig.h`: \r\n\r\n```\r\n/*\\* Use physics integration API. */\r\n# ifndef CC_USE_PHYSICS\r\n# define CC_USE_PHYSICS 1\r\n# endif\r\n```\r\nSo in my project cocos2d config defines `CC_USE_PHYSICS` to `1`.\r\n\r\nThat's why my declaration of class is different from declaration of class cocos2d library was compiled with.\r\nThat leads to `sizeof(PhysicsBody*)` offset for **all** member fields in **all** classes that are inherited from `cocos2d::Node`, resulting in accessing wrong memory.\r\n\r\n**I would be glad if you could change the way CC_USE_PHYSICS is defined, or in best get rid of it.** \r\nI didn't come up with any good idea, it's up to you of course to figure out best possibilities.\r\nAt least you can add a comment to cocos2d cmake about _the need_ to define CC_USE_PHYSICS at project, when user disables Chipmunk usage.\r\nIt can save a lot of time to many folks around.\r\nIt's wasn't that easy to understand what was going on in first place. And newbie developers can stuck at all.\r\n\r\nP.S. As for me, you can provide users with some variable (i.e. `CC_CXX_FLAGS`), so users project can update theirs `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16628/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16627","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16627/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16627/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16627/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16627","id":180050109,"number":16627,"title":"FMOD issues in linux","user":{"login":"Joilnen","id":134140,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/134140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joilnen","html_url":"https://github.com/Joilnen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joilnen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joilnen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joilnen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joilnen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joilnen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joilnen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joilnen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joilnen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joilnen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/milestones/30","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/milestone/30","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/milestones/30/labels","id":1869312,"number":30,"title":"3.14","description":"","creator":{"login":"minggo","id":488203,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/488203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo","html_url":"https://github.com/minggo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":221,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-07-07T07:24:52Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T04:01:21Z","due_on":"2018-01-04T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2017-01-04T04:01:21Z"},"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-09-29T13:32:13Z","updated_at":"2016-11-10T03:30:41Z","closed_at":"2016-11-10T03:30:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- cocos2d-x version: 3.13.1\n- devices test on:  computer (running slackware linux)\n- developing environments\n  - gcc 5.3.0, cmake 3.5.0\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

Therefore it is assumed that '/' does not exist and the subsequent 'mkdir' for '/' fails of course aborting the function by returning false.\n\nI guess that SANDBOX Apps are not allowed to READ '/' because 'openDir' fails?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4753","x-ratelimit-reset":"1506844633","x-github-request-id":"A684:028B:DFEAF0:2F3FEEB:59D09D46","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=58>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=611>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=56>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"7a485a0112bac5076f20482c6fb8a439\"","status":"200 OK"}}
