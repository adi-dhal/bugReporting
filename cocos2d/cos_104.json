Recently, My cocos program crashed on Windows because of the call of logForOpenGLObject() function when I have some errors in my shaders. Then I checked v3 branch, and I found that the problem have been fixed already. However, I've found that these two functions : `logForOpenGLShader()` and `logForOpenGLProgram()` have some flaws:\n\n``` c++\nstatic std::string logForOpenGLShader(GLuint shader)\n{\n    std::string ret;\n    GLint logLength = 0, charsWritten = 0;\n\n    glGetShaderiv(shader, GL_INFO_LOG_LENGTH, &logLength);\n    if (logLength < 1)\n        return \"\";\n\n    char *logBytes = (char*)malloc(logLength + 1);\n    glGetShaderInfoLog(shader, logLength, &charsWritten, logBytes);\n    logBytes[logLength] = '\\0';\n    ret = logBytes;\n\n    free(logBytes);\n    return ret;\n}\n```\n1. I think maybe we should define `std::string ret` in where we really need it. According to my test on android platform the function returns at `return \"\";`, which makes the `ret` unnecessary.\n2. `charsWritten` is not used, it's better to use it or delete it. Because the codes don't check the bytes written, I think we can just delete it.\n3.  (logLength+1) space for `logBytes` is too much, because `logBytes`  returned by calling `glGetShaderInfoLog(shader, logLength, nullptr, logBytes)` takes `logLength` bytes at most, including the ending null character,  i.e. `(strlen(logBytes) + 1 ==  logLength)` always yield true. According to the offical opengles sdk docs: https://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glGetShaderInfoLog.xml.\n   and\n   https://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glGetShaderiv.xml\n4. `logBytes[logLength] = '\\0' is unnecessary, because`logBytes` returned is already null-terminated.\n\n`logForOpenGLProgram()` has the same flaws as `logForOpenGLShader`.\n\nI've created a [pull request](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/14965) for this issue, following are the codes modified:\n\n``` c++\nstatic std::string logForOpenGLShader(GLuint shader)\n{\n    GLint logLength = 0;\n\n    glGetShaderiv(shader, GL_INFO_LOG_LENGTH, &logLength);\n    if (logLength < 1)\n        return \"\";\n\n    char *logBytes = (char*)malloc(sizeof(char) * logLength);\n    glGetShaderInfoLog(shader, logLength, nullptr, logBytes);\n    std::string ret(logBytes);\n\n    free(logBytes);\n    return ret;\n}\n\nstatic std::string logForOpenGLProgram(GLuint program)\n{\n    GLint logLength = 0;\n\n    glGetProgramiv(program, GL_INFO_LOG_LENGTH, &logLength);\n    if (logLength < 1)\n        return \"\";\n\n    char *logBytes = (char*)malloc(sizeof(char) * logLength);\n    glGetProgramInfoLog(program, logLength, nullptr, logBytes);\n    std::string ret(logBytes);\n\n    free(logBytes);\n    return ret;\n}\n```\n\nBy doing this, we save 1 byte and one GLint: `charsWritten' and shorter codes.\n\nMaybe you think this is a trivial fix, but it's good for the better future of cocos. Please consider merge this pull request, Every little helps.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15210/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15209","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15209/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15209/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15209/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/15209","id":139217113,"number":15209,"title":"Fix
