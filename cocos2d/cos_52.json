If none of these are chosen, we will either get GL_ONE/GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA, or GL_SRC_ALPHA/GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA depending on if we have premultiplied alpha. However, if we  examine https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-html5/blob/e10208255f9eae2c25db5e04e395f4258406dbcd/extensions/spine/CCSkeletonWebGLRenderCmd.js#L96, we see that the default behavior is to use the underlying node's blend func. \r\n\r\nThis can cause visual difference between cocos2d-js and cocos2d-x on native. It seems to me that native should match web's functionality, and if we hit the default case, we use the node's current blend func. \r\n\r\nSince SkeletonRenderer is under the spine licence, I wanted to bring this issue to the cocos2d-x team and get their blessing before I submit a PR to spine.
