through on #16846. \r\n\r\nThis adds \"async\" versions of the major FileUtil functions, that will be performed off thread, and callback to the main thread when complete with their result.\r\n\r\nImportant Notes:\r\n\r\nI used the AsyncTaskPool under the task type IO.\r\nIn order to keep the details of the async mechanism self contained, I pulled the functionality to a function called performOperationOffthread. This way if we ever want to change the mechanism from AsyncTaskPool to another threading mechanism, it should be easy.\r\nWhile FileUtils is not thread safe, I was able to work around this by calling \"fullPathForFilename\" on the main thread before calling the delegate functions.\r\nI attempted several template meta-programming solutions to this problem before settling on the submitted approach. All of the template solutions were too complex, and non readable in my opinion.\r\nYou can see I am using a number of value types instead of const-references. This is intentional as we are moving this data between threads, and I want to leverage move semantics.\r\n\r\n@minggo
