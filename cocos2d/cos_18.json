- Cocos2d-x 3.15 and other\r\n - Devices test on: iPhone 6 and any other\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a simple HelloWorld project and add only `scheduleUpdate(); `\r\n2. Check `delta` from \r\n```\r\nvoid HelloWorld::update(float delta) {\r\n    CCLOG(\"%f\",delta);\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice output like this: \r\n\r\n```\r\n0.018591\r\n0.015011\r\n0.017311\r\n0.015939\r\n0.017793\r\n0.015640\r\n0.016709\r\n0.016957\r\n0.017268\r\n0.015884\r\n0.016776\r\n0.016478\r\n0.016699\r\n0.018520\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor compare, same setup but using **cocos2d-iphone v3**, so Objective C, gives me rock and solid output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n0.016720\r\n0.016674\r\n0.016676\r\n0.016675\r\n0.016675\r\n0.016675\r\n0.016707\r\n0.016687\r\n0.016672\r\n0.016677\r\n0.016632\r\n0.016644\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs result, using cocos2d-x for my game(I ported it from cocos2d-iphone) gives me a different result in terms of image quality. Main character moves quickly and as result image is not so.. clear, nice and smooth as was before in cocos2d-iphone. I'm not talking about jitter or other very noticeable things, but this problem I can clearly identify.

In my App I send a JPG image to my server. This code works fine under Android / iOS / Mac / Win32. However, under WinUWP this code corrupts my image. The image is somehow splitted and the bottom part is cut away. My server appears to receive multiple corrupted/splitted files instead of one.\r\n\r\nThe WinUWP Network class uses a different code path than the other OS right? Maybe something is wrong there? So far I didn't manage to narrow down the problem cause any further.\r\n\r\nRemark: I tried to transfer the image as base64 encoded string. Same problem. It doesn't seem to be related to the payload. But I discovered that the request length on the server is always around 130KB. It seems to be truncated at this length. On Win32 for example the length is correct (same length as on the client).\r\n\r\n```\r\nHttpRequest* createMultipartRequest(const std::string& requestUrl, const Json::Value& jsonPart, const std::string& binaryPath)\r\n{\r\n        HttpRequest* request = new (std::nothrow) HttpRequest();\r\n        request->setUrl(requestUrl.c_str());\r\n        request->setRequestType(HttpRequest::Type::POST);\r\n        \r\n        std::string boundary = \"---------------------------14737809831466499882746641449\";\r\n        \r\n        std::vector<std::string> headers;\r\n        headers.push_back(\"Accept: application/json\");\r\n        headers.push_back(\"Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=\" + boundary);\r\n        request->setHeaders(headers);\r\n        \r\n        std::stringstream ss;\r\n        ss << \"--\" << boundary << \"\\r\\n\";\r\n        ss << \"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"json_data\\\"\\r\\n\";\r\n        ss << \"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8\\r\\n\";\r\n        ss << \"Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\\r\\n\\r\\n\";\r\n        ss << JsonUtils::writeToString(jsonPart);\r\n        \r\n        Data data = FileUtils::getInstance()->getDataFromFile(binaryPath);\r\n        std::string binaryName = binaryPath.substr(binaryPath.find_last_of('/') + 1);\r\n        \r\n        ss << \"\\r\\n--\" << boundary << \"\\r\\n\";\r\n        ss << \"Content-Disposition: attachment; name=\\\"\" << binaryName << \"\\\"; filename=\\\"\" << binaryName << \"\\\"\\r\\n\";\r\n        ss << \"Content-Type: application/octet-stream\\r\\n\";\r\n        ss << \"Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary\\r\\n\\r\\n\";\r\n        ss << std::string((char*)data.getBytes(), data.getSize());\r\n        ss << \"\\r\\n--\" << boundary << \"--\\r\\n\";\r\n        \r\n        std::string multipartStr = ss.str();\r\n        request->setRequestData(multipartStr.data(), multipartStr.size());\r\n        return request;\r\n}\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17794/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17793","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17793/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17793/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17793/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17793","id":226927751,"number":17793,"title":"run JS_CallFunctionValue in Sub-Thread produce JS: <no filename=\"filename\">:0:too much recursion","user":{"login":"yemingyu","id":8455886,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8455886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yemingyu","html_url":"https://github.com/yemingyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yemingyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yemingyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yemingyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yemingyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yemingyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yemingyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yemingyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yemingyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yemingyu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-05-08T03:27:50Z","updated_at":"2017-05-15T00:52:37Z","closed_at":"2017-05-15T00:52:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- cocos2d-x version: latest\r\n- devices test on: iOS\r\n- developing environments\r\n   - NDK version:\r\n   - Xcode version: 8.3\r\n   - VS version:\r\n   - browser type and version:\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17792","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17792/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17792/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17792/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17792","id":226864541,"number":17792,"title":"Test for orthogonal camera.
