A problem with Date.now() is that it only has millisecond precision, which is not always useful for measuring certain operations. This PR attempts to give cocos2d-js performance.now(), which is an open standard available in modern browsers. You can read the details here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/now, and the spec here https://www.w3.org/TR/hr-time/#dom-performance-now.\n\nThe quick summary, is that performance.now measures time in milliseconds (up to micro second precision), from the \"time origin\". I am defining the time origin for us to be the call of ScriptingCore::start(). In order to satisfy the requirement of a monotonic clock, I am using std::chrono::steady_clock.
