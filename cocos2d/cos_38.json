Build a test application that plays an unsupported audio file format (such as AAC/MP4 on Windows).\r\nIf the player->_removeByAudioEngine is set to **true** at any point, then the AudioEngine will remove the audioID from the list, but it never actually calls _finishCallbak (it should be renamed _finishCallback if this code is ever updated). \r\n\r\nIf an audio file is never played (ie, invalid audio format), or there is another issue preventing the sound from being played, the AudioEngine treats it as everything is ok, and simply removes the audio instance without calling _finishCallbak.  For game code that relies on the finishCallbak, it never occurs, so the game will be stuck waiting for something that will never happen.\r\n\r\nThe following is the code from AudioEngine-win32.cpp where the issue exists (same for Android/iOS etc), AudioEngineImpl::update(float dt).\r\n\r\nThe \"if\" and \"else if\" conditions both do the same thing, which is remove the audio from the _audioPlayers map, but only the \"else if\" condition calls the finishedCallbak.  If a sound is removed from _audioPlayers, then technically it has stopped, whether it was played or not.  It doesn't make much sense to have the if/else if condition there when the purpose is the same.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    for (auto it = _audioPlayers.begin(); it != _audioPlayers.end(); ) {\r\n        audioID = it->first;\r\n        player = it->second;\r\n        alGetSourcei(player->_alSource, AL_SOURCE_STATE, &sourceState);\r\n\r\n        if (player->_removeByAudioEngine)\r\n        {\r\n            _alSourceUsed[player->_alSource] = false;\r\n\r\n            AudioEngine::remove(audioID);\r\n            _threadMutex.lock();\r\n            it = _audioPlayers.erase(it);\r\n            _threadMutex.unlock();\r\n            delete player;\r\n        }\r\n        else if (player->_ready && sourceState == AL_STOPPED) {\r\n\r\n            _alSourceUsed[player->_alSource] = false;\r\n            if (player->_finishCallbak) {\r\n                auto& audioInfo = AudioEngine::_audioIDInfoMap[audioID];\r\n                player->_finishCallbak(audioID, *audioInfo.filePath); //FIXME: callback will delay 50ms\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            AudioEngine::remove(audioID);\r\n            delete player;\r\n            _threadMutex.lock();\r\n            it = _audioPlayers.erase(it);\r\n            _threadMutex.unlock();\r\n        }\r\n        else{\r\n            ++it;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf there isn't a specific reason why the if/else if is there, then the code should be changed to the following in all implementations (win32/Android/iOS etc):\r\n\r\n```\r\n    for (auto it = _audioPlayers.begin(); it != _audioPlayers.end(); ) {\r\n        audioID = it->first;\r\n        player = it->second;\r\n        alGetSourcei(player->_alSource, AL_SOURCE_STATE, &sourceState);\r\n\r\n        if (player->_removeByAudioEngine || (player->_ready && sourceState == AL_STOPPED))\r\n        {\r\n            _alSourceUsed[player->_alSource] = false;\r\n            if (player->_finishCallbak) {\r\n                auto& audioInfo = AudioEngine::_audioIDInfoMap[audioID];\r\n                player->_finishCallbak(audioID, *audioInfo.filePath); //FIXME: callback will delay 50ms\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            AudioEngine::remove(audioID);\r\n            _threadMutex.lock();\r\n            it = _audioPlayers.erase(it);\r\n            _threadMutex.unlock();\r\n            delete player;\r\n        }\r\n
