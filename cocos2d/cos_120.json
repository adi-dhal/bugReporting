fixes compilation error when building cocos2d-x demo by CrystaX NDK.\n\nAccording to [POSIX](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/stdint.h.html), `uint32_t` is defined in \"stdint.h\", so if you use it in code, you should include \"stdint.h\".\n\nIn Google's Android NDK it works because their \"iosfwd\" include \"stdint.h\" implicitly; however, it's not a requirement and you shouldn't rely on that.\n\nWith this fix, cocos2d-x demo getting built no matter which NDK is used - CrystaX or Google's one.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14727/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4690","x-ratelimit-reset":"1506844633","x-github-request-id":"9C4E:0285:1065334:20259A2:59D09F3E","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=121>;
