Completely rewrite the slice-9 feature of ui::Scale9Sprite. The new Scale9Sprite inherits from Sprite with type default to `Sliced`.\n2. Now the Slice sprite uses 16 vertices and 54 indices instead of the old 9 sprite way.\n   The memory consumption is much lower than the previous implementation. And it is also more time efficient.\n3. Fix a bug when scale9sprite shrink smaller than the center stretch area. \n4. A few minor change to use the new slice sprite in UI widgets. No behavior changed!  If you notice one, please report.\n\nNote: **SpriteBatchNode**  can't support the new sliced sprite at the moment. In the past, it also the same. The original Scale9Sprite is a node, so it can't be added into the `SpriteBtachNode`.\nBut now the Sliced sprite is a Sprite which means it should be OK when adding it to the `SpriteBatchNode`.  \n\nI suggest we mention this restrict in the release note and fix it in the future release.

Fix a bug when scale9sprite shrink smaller than the center stretch area. \n4. A few minor change to use the new slice sprite in UI widgets. No behavior changed!  If you notice one, please report.\n\nNote: **SpriteBatchNode**  can't support the new sliced sprite at the moment. In the past, it also the same. The original Scale9Sprite is a node, so it can't be added into the `SpriteBtachNode`.\nBut now the Sliced sprite is a Sprite which means it should be OK when adding it to the `SpriteBatchNode`.  \n\nI suggest we mention this restrict in the release note and fix it in the future release. Thoughts?\n\n@dabingnn  @ricardoquesada  @super626  Please help me to review this PR.\n\nAny testing or suggestions will be welcome.\n\nThanks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14211/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14210","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14210/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14210/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14210/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/14210","id":112751395,"number":14210,"title":"Fix
