develop environment is consist of eclipse, cocos2d-x 3.10, windows 10 64bit and\nmy android build target is Android 6.0\n\nI want to use getRandomObject() in cocos2d::Vector class.\nIt works well on win32-platform, but the same code doesn't work in android-platform.\nso I track my class's member methods. And figure out rand() function cause this problem.\n\ngetRandomObject function in CCVector is:\n\nT getRandomObject() const\n    {\n        if (!_data.empty())\n        {\n            ssize_t randIdx = rand() % _data.size();\n            return *(_data.begin() + randIdx);\n        }\n        return nullptr;\n    }\n\nIn addition, it can be caused that it would be non-complete random object.\n\nso I recommend to change a function with using a RandomHelper class in cocos2d-x\n\nor using a uniform_real_distribution in std namespace.\n\nlike this:\n\nT getRandomObject() const\n    {\n        if
