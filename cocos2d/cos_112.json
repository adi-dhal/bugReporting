FileUtils will invoke delegate's implementation.\n * For example, your resources are encrypted, so you need to decrypt it after reading data from\n * resources, then you can implement all getXXX functions, and engine will invoke your own getXX\n * functions when reading data of resources.\n```\n\nBut the constructor of  FileUtilsLinux, FileUtilsWin32 and FileUtilsWinRT are private.\n\nSo make these constructors protected which allows inherit from them.\n\n---\n\nBTW:\n\nWhy inheritance?\nWhy not something like `FileUtils::setCrypt(const Crypt& crypt)`.\nAfter set, `Crypt::encrypt()` are called before save data/string to file.\nand `Crypt::decrypt()` are called after read data/string from file.\nIf not set a Crypt to file utils, just do normal reading and

replaces the usage of `const char*` with `const std::string&` in `HttpRequest::setUrl()` and `setTag()` arguments, for the following reasons:\n- Both `_url` and `_tag` members are `std::string` type.\n- To avoid calling `std::string::c_str()` when passing arguments to them\n\nAlso, there are no backwards breaking changes to APIs.
