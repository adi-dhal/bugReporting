work on iOS devices when cerated with Lua. The sprite looks the same as if the method runAction was not executed.\n\nI tested OS X for both C++ and Lua, and it works ok, also the iOS simulator seems to run the action. On iOS devices (iPod Touch 4g and iPad mini) only C++ seems to work.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15097","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15097/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15097/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15097/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/15097","id":135424282,"number":15097,"title":"Removed if else check for previous file","user":{"login":"damorton","id":3397660,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3397660?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/damorton","html_url":"https://github.com/damorton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damorton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damorton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damorton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damorton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damorton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damorton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damorton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damorton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damorton/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-02-22T13:57:29Z","updated_at":"2016-03-29T03:24:45Z","closed_at":"2016-03-29T03:24:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pulls/15097","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/15097","diff_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/15097.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/15097.patch"},"body":"This if else is causing issues on Windows Emulator 10.0.10586.
