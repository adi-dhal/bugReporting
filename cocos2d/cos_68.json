version: 3.12\n### Steps to Reproduce:\n1. Create a label with string of 90 characters\n2. Observe SpriteBatchNode increasing it's capacity 4 times. Each time memory is reseated, indices reinitialised and the GL buffers remapped.  \n   29 -> 40  \n   40 -> 54  \n   54 -> 73  \n   73 -> 98  \n### Proposed solution:\n\nFollow behaviour of std::vector:\nWhen assigned initial content it's capacity will equal it's size. When new content is subsequently added std::vector doubles it's existing capacity. If new content would exceed the doubled capacity, match capacity exactly to fit.\ne.g.\n\n```\nstd::vector<int> vec = {1,2,3}; \n//initial: vec.capacity() == 3\n\nvec.push_back(4); \n//double: vec.capacity() == 6\n\nvec.insert(vec.end(), {5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13});\n//double capacity would be 12, but as new content exceeds this we use content size instead\n//content: vec.capacity() == 13\n```\n\nFurthermore we should expose ability to manually set capacity to allow developers to 'warm' labels they expect to be displaying large amounts of content in the future.\n### References:\n\n[Origin forum thread](http://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/t/cocos2d-x-version-3-xx-is-resize-textureatlast-capacity-a-problem/16408/9)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16292","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16292/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16292/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16292/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/16292","id":168825907,"number":16292,"title":"implement bsd_sinal for compiling or Android 21+","user":{"login":"minggo","id":488203,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/488203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo","html_url":"https://github.com/minggo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-08-02T08:19:00Z","updated_at":"2016-08-02T08:52:15Z","closed_at":"2016-08-02T08:52:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pulls/16292","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/16292","diff_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/16292.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/16292.patch"},"body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16291","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16291/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16291/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16291/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16291","id":168793295,"number":16291,"title":"[Cocos2d-js] How to release JSScheduleWrapper? memory keeps grow up.","user":{"login":"iNeverSleeeeep","id":8469299,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8469299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iNeverSleeeeep","html_url":"https://github.com/iNeverSleeeeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iNeverSleeeeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iNeverSleeeeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iNeverSleeeeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iNeverSleeeeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iNeverSleeeeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iNeverSleeeeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iNeverSleeeeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iNeverSleeeeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iNeverSleeeeep/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":203148337,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/labels/script:jsb","name":"script:jsb","color":"5319e7","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-08-02T03:46:51Z","updated_at":"2017-01-26T08:32:06Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- cocos2d-x version: cocos2d-x-3.9\n- devices test on: Mac Mini\n- developing environments\n  -
