This way if we ever want to change the mechanism from AsyncTaskPool to another threading mechanism, it should be easy.\r\n- While FileUtils is not thread safe, I was able to work around this by calling \"fullPathForFilename\" on the main thread before calling the delegate functions. \r\n- I attempted several template meta-programming solutions to this problem before settling on the submitted approach. All of the template solutions were too complex, and non readable in my opinion.\r\n- You can see I am using a number of value types instead of const-references. This is intentional as we are moving this data between threads, and I want to leverage move semantics.

The create method on a RenderTexture can accept a depthStencilFormat.\r\n\r\nWhen supplying depthStencilFormat, `GL_DEPTH24_STENCIL8` for example, the \r\nRenderTexture internally creates and attaches a depth buffer. However the RenderTexture results are mostly blank and glitchy.\r\n\r\n![sprite3d_rendertextures_1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/775602/20572415/f9651b1c-b170-11e6-942a-ad8ec55cc8a9.png)\r\n\r\nIssue found on both OS X and iPhone builds.
