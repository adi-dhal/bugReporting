just found that the hitbox of TextField is completely wrong.\n\nTake this sample code, use cocos 3.6 (or 3.7):\n\n```\n    auto createTextField = [](const std::string placeHolder, const std::string text) -> Node*\n    {\n        auto fieldSize = Size(600,100);\n        auto tf = ui::TextField::create(placeHolder, \"fonts/arial.ttf\", 44);\n        auto bg = LayerColor::create(Color4B::RED, fieldSize.width, fieldSize.height);\n        tf->setAnchorPoint(Vec2::ANCHOR_MIDDLE);\n        tf->setPosition(fieldSize / 2);\n        tf->setTextColor(Color4B::BLUE);\n        tf->setTextHorizontalAlignment(TextHAlignment::CENTER);\n        tf->setTouchAreaEnabled(true);\n        tf->setTouchSize(fieldSize);\n        tf->setString(text);\n        bg->addChild(tf);\n

the whole Layer size). And I expect it to become inactive when I touch outside the box.\n\nBut running this sample, it **becomes active** when you touch **somewhere to the left outside** of the box, and it **doesn't** when you touch **inside it somewhere to its right**.\n\nI quickly looked at the hitTest method and it seems it's incorrectly computing the boundingbox of the textfield when a touchArea is specified.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13235","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13235/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13235/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13235/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13235","id":99290638,"number":13235,"title":"UIScrollView

scene is moved/scaled physics node positioning is broken. To replicate in \ncocos2d-x-3.7\\tests\\cpp-tests\\classes\\physicstest\\physicstest.cpp function PhysicsDemo::init() add \nthis->setPosition(Vec2(-24.0f, -24.0f)) before return. Navigate to Node: Physics and then to Physics Test - multitouch to add grossini. Click Toggle debug to turn debug draw on. Observe how the debug draw is full width of image (48px rather then 24px) off. At some point moving and scaling scene may change relative position of objects, and in extreme cases actually position images outside of the edge node and completely break physics.\nWorks correctly in v3.3\nMight be related to https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12943 (but adjusted for position)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13226/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4958","x-ratelimit-reset":"1506848236","x-github-request-id":"82CE:028B:E10302:2F7A1FD:59D0A14F","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=171>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=611>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=169>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"6feb4b5c340d8c9c9299067356c5c28c\"","status":"200 OK"}}
