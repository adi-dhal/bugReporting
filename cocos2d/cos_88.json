I use the latest cocos2d-x (since commit 86df9b535a5d51479ee6eaa93b85d991b4c3c974) in my project with Visual Studio 2015, I got a lot of warning messages about `Node::ignoreAnchorPointForPosition()` was declared deprecated.\n\nThen I tried to build libcocos2d and cpp-tests, it can reproduce the same warning as following:\n\n```\n5>cocos\\2d/CCSprite.h(474): warning C4996: 'cocos2d::Node::ignoreAnchorPointForPosition': was declared deprecated (compiling source file ..\\ui\\UIButton.cpp)\n5>cocos\\2d/CCSprite.h(474): warning C4996:

'cocos2d::Node::ignoreAnchorPointForPosition': was declared deprecated (compiling source file

C4996 seem to be caused by the `Sprite::ignoreAnchorPointForPosition()` function which override the deprecated `Node::ignoreAnchorPointForPosition()` function in the `CCSprite.h` file. I know we need to fully support the `ignoreAnchorPointForPosition()` for backwards compatibility, but those warning messages are too many for me (and CI such as Jenkins).\n\nSo this PR removes the function definition of the `Sprite::ignoreAnchorPointForPosition()` to prevent the warning, for these reasons:\n- `Sprite::ignoreAnchorPointForPosition()` and `Sprite::setIgnoreAnchorPointForPosition()` are both overridding virtual functions of the `Node` class.\n- `Node::ignoreAnchorPointForPosition()` calls `setIgnoreAnchorPointForPosition()` internally. \n- `Sprite::setIgnoreAnchorPointForPosition()` is executed when the `Node::ignoreAnchorPointForPosition()` is invoked instead of `Sprite::ignoreAnchorPointForPosition()`.\n- This change will not affect C++ APIs and the documentation generated by doxygen.\n\nIn other words, I think it's unnecessary to explicitly keep the definition of the `Sprite::ignoreAnchorPointForPosition()`.\n\nI've also tried to verify if this change keeps backwards compatibility with the following test case:\n\n```\nauto sprite = Sprite::create(\"HelloWorld.png\");\n\n// `Sprite::setIgnoreAnchorPointForPosition()` function can be invoked in 3 different ways:\nsprite->ignoreAnchorPointForPosition(true);\nsprite->Sprite::ignoreAnchorPointForPosition(true);\nstatic_cast<Node*>(sprite)->ignoreAnchorPointForPosition(true);\n\naddChild(sprite);\n```\n\nThe same issue has been reported here:\nhttp://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/t/gen-libs-error-c4996/29404\n\nThank you for taking your time to read this. :smiley:\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15692/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15691","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15691/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15691/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15691/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15691","id":156011005,"number":15691,"title":"Ubuntu 16.04 -
