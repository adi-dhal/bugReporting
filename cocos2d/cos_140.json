noted that the result of calling _getLocation()_ and _getLocationInView()_ from **EventMouse** and **EventTouch** is returning a different value on Win32 platform.\nDigging a bit the sources I noted there is a different code path between touches events and mouse events.\nStarting from the _CCGLViewImpl-desktop.cpp_ file, inside the method _GLViewImpl::onGLFWMouseCallBack_ at line 646~647 we have:\n\n``` cpp\n//Because OpenGL and cocos2d-x uses different Y axis, we need to convert the coordinate here\nfloat cursorX = (_mouseX - _viewPortRect.origin.x) / _scaleX;\nfloat cursorY = (_viewPortRect.origin.y + _viewPortRect.size.height - _mouseY) / _scaleY;\n```\n\nthat I think it's wrong because it's already calculating the OpenGL values and this values will be then passed to the variabled inside the **EventMouse** returned by _getLocationInView()_.\n\nInstead the code path that handles the touches events is doing that:\n\n``` cpp\ntouch->setTouchInfo(unusedIndex, (x - _viewPortRect.origin.x) / _scaleX, (y - _viewPortRect.origin.y) / _scaleY);\n```\n\nwhere _x_ and _y_ are filled with the values of __mouseX_ e __mouseY_.\nI'm not sure if this is a issue of something desired, but it create the need to have different app code path handling the input event between touches-handling and mouse-handling.\n\nI think the fix should be placed in the _GLViewImpl::onGLFWMouseCallBack_ method changing the lines 646~647 like this:\n\n``` cpp\n//Because OpenGL and cocos2d-x uses different Y axis, we need to convert the coordinate here\nfloat cursorX =

am currently developing a game with Cocos2d-x 3.7 (updated the project to 3.8.1 to check if the problem would magically go away, but it didn't. Same with cocos2d-x 3.9). The game is a kind of endless runner, and I am using the `cocos2d::MotionStreak` class to add a nice effect to the coins collected by the player. Coins travel to the coins counter when the player collides with them, and each coin has a MotionStreak effect.\n\nYou can see a video of the game here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kaxf1Imu600\n\nAnd a screenshot:\n![a62f47b4-7d5b-11e5-9b6d-c598ba90c374](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2997598/10784073/437916bc-7d5c-11e5-986e-325c6e8bad4d.png)\n\nI've been developing and testing the game for a couple of months and everything seemed fine. But someday I decided to dramatically increase the speed of the game, as a stress test or just for fun. But after some seconds of gameplay, a crash occurred: \n\n**Crash 1:**\n\n`CCASSERT(_glprogram, \"invalid glprogram\");` <- EXC_BAD_ACCESS\n\n![caf4a85340fe894e](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2997598/10507890/18acbcbe-7324-11e5-8cd6-427eab3bca8c.png)\n\nI do not know how I ended suspecting of the MotionStreak effect, but I tried to comment the lines where I created and added the MotionStreak effect to each coin. And after a lot of games, I did not manage to reproduce the crash. To confirm that it was something about the MotionStreak, I enabled the MotionStreak effect again and it brought the crashes back.\n\nI found it was a lot more frequent on older devices, such as the iPhone 4 or iPad mini 1, than on newer devices, like the iPod Touch 6. ~~I haven't tested it on Android as debugging is more difficult as I only want to use Xcode~~. **Edit:** I tested it on Android devices with same results: powerful devices such as LG G3 crash a lot less frequently than mid/low tier devices.\n\nI also got other less frequent crashes:\n\n**Crash 2:**\n\n`CCASSERT(command->getType() != RenderCommand::Type::UNKNOWN_COMMAND, \"Invalid Command Type\");` <- Signal SIGABRT (the assertion did not succeed)\n\n![310eaea3426dfe8c](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2997598/10507908/2add1a0a-7324-11e5-960b-feda69c4fb6a.png)\n\n---\n\n**Crash 3:**\n\n`cocos2d::Renderer::fillQuads(cocos2d::QuadCommand *cmd)` <- EXC_BAD_ACCESS inside this function \n\n![cee1a9964f2831b2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2997598/10507915/3a0f7f22-7324-11e5-8ed5-3b63cfd6be01.png)\n\n---\n\n**Crash 4:**\n\n`CCASSERT(cmd->getQuadCount()>= 0 && cmd->getQuadCount() * 4 < VBO_SIZE, \"VBO for vertex is not big enough, please break the data down or use customized render command\");` <- Signal SIGABRT  (the assertion did not succeed)\n\n![a4274367402a157a](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2997598/10507917/3f5c00cc-7324-11e5-9680-630a1a8ca4e6.png)\n\n---\n\nYou could say: \"Hey, but your game ran perfectly before increasing the gameplay speed. Why don't you just set it as before?\"\n\n**The problem** is that the game's velocity slowly increases in order to become more difficult. Besides, I was planning to create a power up that boosts the player a lot. Not to mention the quantity of different compatible devices which could behave differently and crash at lower speeds.\n\nI don't know, but it could be related to the way MotionStreak nodes load textures (for some reason I can't correctly use the sprite sheet here, as it shows the whole texture instead of only the portion corresponding to the trail texture), as I have to specify the texture apart from the sprite sheet:\n\n`auto motionStreak = MotionStreak::create(fade, minSeg, stroke, Color3B(220, 255, 124), \"trail.png\");`\n\nAny light on these dark MotionStreak crashes?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14149/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14148","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14148/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14148/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14148/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14148","id":111563787,"number":14148,"title":"can
