In the cocos2d app I scheduled an update function (about every 16ms, with `this.scheduleUpdate()` ), and during every update cycle I tried to send a signal to the socket.io server via `socket.emit()`. When I set the server up to measure how many incoming signals there are per second, weird things happen:\n- in cocos2d-html5 (`cocos run -p web`) the received signals max out at around 60 signals per second. Everything looks fine.\n- when I compile a Linux binary (`cocos run -p linux`) the received signals max out at 20 per second BUT they are buffered from 60 per second. Meaning the app actually generates 60 socket.emit()s per second, but only send them out 20 at a time. Therefore 1 second of app runtime will generate 3 seconds of signals with 20 signals each. \n\nThis creates a huge lag in any live-multiplayer scenario. Can anybody reproduce this, please, or is this a well-known bug by any chance? It just seems arbitrary.\n\nThe only solution I found so far was to limit the cocos2d app to only ever send 20 emits per second.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15363/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15362","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15362/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15362/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15362/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/15362","id":145366775,"number":15362,"title":"[ci

I have a vertex shader that defines 3 attributes.

the problem disappears.\nHere is my non-working vertex shader:\n\n```\n#ifdef GL_ES\nprecision mediump float;\n#endif\n\nattribute vec2 normal;\nattribute vec2 path;\nattribute float miter;\n\nuniform
