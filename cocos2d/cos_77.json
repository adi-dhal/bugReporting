warning could be easily solved by simply adding the `f` suffix for floating point constant. So this pull request adds missing float suffix to avoid those warnings and casting float to double.\n\nThank you for considering

you've got the following setup: a `ui::Widget` is added to a `ui::ListView`, then sometime later, instead of using `removeChild` on the `ui::ListView`, you  call [`my_widget->removeFromParent()`](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/blob/v3/cocos/2d/CCNode.cpp#L994), the `ListView::innerContainer::removeChild` gets called, instead of [`ListView::removeChild`](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/blob/v3/cocos/ui/UIListView.cpp#L298), leaving `ListView::_items` untouched. So if you kept calling [`my_listview->addChild(my_widget)`](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/blob/v3/cocos/ui/UIListView.cpp#L271), you'd get an infinite amount of `my_widget` pointers in the `_items` vector, because the linked code would never get called.\n\nSome non-compiling example code:\n\n```\nui::Button* my_button = ui::Button::create(whatever);\nui::ListView* my_listview = ui::ListView::create(whatever);\n\nmy_listview->addChild(my_button);\n//through ListView::addChild, my_listview->_items->push_back is called, and my_listview->innerContainer gets my_button added\nmy_button->removeFromParent();\n//effectively innerContainer->removeChild(my_button) is called\n// now my_listview->_items still has my_button in it, size=1, while innerContainer does not\nmy_listview->addChild(my_button);\n// now my_listview->_items still has my_button in it and a copy of the pointer, size=2\n```\n\nHope this is clear enough. Not sure what a solution would be, beyond checking to make sure the type of `_parent` doesn't have `_items` or something, but that's pretty clunky.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16028/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16027","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16027/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16027/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16027/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/16027","id":163590384,"number":16027,"title":"[ci
