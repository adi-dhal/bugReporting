But when I call the setText it will set the label visible if the text's lenght is not zero which contribute to the overlay.My resolution is:\r\n  define a bool  variable(named editting) in the EditBoxImplCommon class, set it true in the EditBoxImplCommon::editBoxEditingDidBegin and false in the EditBoxImplCommon::editBoxEditingDidEnd, then in the EditBoxImplCommon::setText, if editting then don't call the refreshInactiveText(the method update the label's display)\r\nvoid EditBoxImplCommon::editBoxEditingDidBegin()\r\n{\r\n    // LOGD(\"textFieldShouldBeginEditing...\");\r\n    _editting = true;\r\n    cocos2d::ui::EditBoxDelegate *pDelegate = _editBox->getDelegate();\r\n    \r\n    if (pDelegate != nullptr)\r\n    {\r\n        pDelegate->editBoxEditingDidBegin(_editBox);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  void EditBoxImplCommon::editBoxEditingDidEnd(const std::string& text, EditBoxDelegate::EditBoxEndAction action)\r\n{\r\n    // LOGD(\"textFieldShouldEndEditing...\");\r\n    _text = text;\r\n    _editting = false;\r\n\r\nvoid EditBoxImplCommon::setText(const char* text)\r\n{\r\n    this->setNativeText(text);\r\n    _text = text;\r\n    if (!_editting)\r\n        refreshInactiveText();\r\n}\r\n2. iOS placeholder's font and color, the iOS native input view if UITextField but the inputModel is EDITBOX_INPUT_MODE_ANY, the most simple handle is just add a method in the UITextField's Category:UITextField+CCUITextInput.mm\r\n- (UILabel *)ccui_placeholderLabel\r\n{\r\n    return [self valueForKey:@\"_placeholderLabel\"];\r\n}\r\nbut you shoud setup the editbox in the follow order:\r\nsetInputMode->setPlaceHolder->setPlaceholderFont or setPlaceholderFontColor, if not, you may get nil from the function ccui_placeholderLabel's return.\r\nThe best method is set the UITextFiled's attributedPlaceholder whith string、 font and color.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17608/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17607","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17607/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17607/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17607/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/17607","id":217756908,"number":17607,"title":"Fixes ConsoleUploadFile test could not work on android.","user":{"login":"dumganhar","id":493372,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/493372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dumganhar","html_url":"https://github.com/dumganhar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dumganhar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dumganhar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dumganhar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dumganhar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dumganhar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dumganhar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dumganhar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dumganhar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dumganhar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-03-29T03:45:31Z","updated_at":"2017-04-12T10:10:00Z","closed_at":"2017-03-29T06:23:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pulls/17607","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/17607","diff_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/17607.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/17607.patch"},"body":"* Should not use fread to read file from assets, uses FileUtils::getDataFromFile instead.\r\n* Client socket should not be closed immediatelly after ::send.

Press the three buttons that draw text on renderTexture, you will find only \" Camera8 Button visit RenderTexture\" not work.**\r\n\r\n**3. I have got the reason, It's because when we press on button(or any touches), the current visiting camera is set the same as that button's cammera, the code is in CCEventDispatcher.cpp in function dispatchTouchEventToListeners(...)**\r\n             Camera::_visitingCamera = camera;\r\nThis code make the text:visit() failed, because of camera of text and camera of current visiting camera    not matched.\r\n\r\n**4. I suggest we should set Camera::_visitingCamera to nullptr in renderTexture:begin(), and recover it in renderTexture:end()**\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17599/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17598","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17598/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17598/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17598/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17598","id":217439623,"number":17598,"title":"Scheduler

Create sprite and sequence, then run action ([reference](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/wiki/Actions#An-example-sequence))\r\n```cpp\r\n\t// create a sprite\r\n\tauto mySprite = Sprite::create(\"HelloWorld.png\");\r\n\tmySprite->setPosition(visibleSize * 0.5f);\r\n\r\n\t// create a MoveBy Action to where we want the sprite to drop from.\r\n\tauto move = MoveBy::create(1, Vec2(100, 100));\r\n\tauto moveBack = MoveBy::create(1, Vec2(-100, -100));\r\n\r\n\t// create a delay that is run in between sequence events\r\n\tauto delay = DelayTime::create(0.25f);\r\n\r\n\t// create the sequence of actions, in the order we want to run them\r\n\tauto seq1 = Sequence::create(move, delay, moveBack, delay->clone(), nullptr);\r\n\r\n\t// run the sequence and repeat forever.\r\n\tmySprite->runAction(RepeatForever::create(seq1));\r\n\r\n\tthis->addChild(mySprite);\r\n```\r\nI tried with several other ways with RepeatForever and Sequence, it seems to happen when there is more than 1 actions in the sequence.\r\n\r\nCreating sequence with only 1 action like\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n\tauto seq2 = Sequence::create(rotateBy, nullptr);\r\n```\r\n\r\nworked as expected but creating more than 1 like\r\n```cpp\r\n\tauto seq3 = Sequence::create(rotateBy, delay, nullptr);\r\n```\r\ncaused the same issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17581","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17581/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17581/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17581/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17581","id":216742164,"number":17581,"title":"getMesh() and getMeshCount() not work","user":{"login":"kamranrad1993","id":12828782,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12828782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamranrad1993","html_url":"https://github.com/kamranrad1993","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamranrad1993/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamranrad1993/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamranrad1993/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamranrad1993/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamranrad1993/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamranrad1993/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamranrad1993/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamranrad1993/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamranrad1993/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-03-24T10:53:21Z","updated_at":"2017-03-24T10:53:21Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- cocos2d-x version: 3.14\r\n- devices test on: pc(linux)\r\n- developing environments :\r\n     qtcreator\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nhi.\r\ni create a multipart mesh in blender and convert it to c3b file .\r\nthen load it with sprite3d in cocos2d getMeshCount return zero and getMesh return runtime error.\r\nwhat happened and what can i do?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4785","x-ratelimit-reset":"1506844633","x-github-request-id":"DF1A:028A:1AF3BFC:2F3748D:59D09C4D","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=26>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=611>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=24>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"82906e6c1057914ae5df9c7ab9936723\"","status":"200 OK"}}
