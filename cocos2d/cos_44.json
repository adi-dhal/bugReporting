only currently supports the origin being in the bottom left. The engine has the ability to change the anchor point of a node, and toggle if this anchor point will be used for positioning calculations, however there is no way to change the basis of the coordinate system. It seems that overall there is a desire to support upper-left, and center based coordinate systems. \r\n\r\nThis can be accomplished by a project using additional transforms, however this can be complicated when factoring in CCActions, as the CCActions can change the scale and rotation. with updating the users additional transform. This can also be done by adding additional nodes to the hierarchy, but this adds memory and cpu overhead. \r\n\r\nI propose two additional concepts to be added to cocos:\r\n\r\n- The ability to change where a node anchor's itself, which is decoupled from where it scales and rotates itself from. Basically an Anchor Point used only for positioning. \r\n- The ability to change where a node is positioned relative to it's parent. With this, I have the ability to set my coordinate system to 0,0 being either in the center, or the upper left, or the bottom left.\r\n\r\nThe code may look like this. (Not tested, just a rough idea)\r\n(in Node::getNodeToParentTransform)\r\n```\r\n        if (_isUsingPositionAnchor) // replaces _ignoreAnchorPointForPosition\r\n        {\r\n            auto&& p = getPositionAnchorInPoints();\r\n            x += _anchorPointInPoints.x + p.x;\r\n            y += _anchorPointInPoints.y + p.y;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        if (_parent && _parent->isUsingPositionBasis())\r\n        {\r\n            auto&& p = _parent->getPositionBasisInPoints();\r\n            x += p.x;\r\n            y += p.y;\r\n        }\r\n        // rest of code...\r\n```\r\n\r\n@minggo @ricardoquesada Is this something you are interested in?
