8.2.1 (8C1002)\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n \r\n1. The project is landscape . (iOS project Device Orientation setting supports Landscape & Portrait)\r\n2. The project should have an EditBox on the screen.\r\n3. run the project on device，then switch screen .\r\n4. you can open wechat or QQ ，chat just show the keyboard.\r\n5. back the project，great probability cause screen confusion.\r\n\r\n操蛋，我还是直接说中文得了。2dx 在初始化 一个EditBox 输入框后，就一直在侦听键盘事件，侦听就算了，你还一直处理 你们的GLView 大小和位置。有时候对接第三方SDK ，第三方有输入框 键盘事件变化你们也处理，切到微信、QQ等聊天 键盘你们也处理。有的第三方可是有强制竖屏的界面，这时候只要 横屏游戏配置了 竖屏支持，就有很大概率 出现 错屏 现象。\r\n\r\n花了半天时间才定位到2dx问题。解决方案就是 修改 CCEAGLView-ios.mm （老版本是CCEAGLView.mm）。\r\n修改\r\n-(void) doAnimationWhenKeyboardMoveWithDuration:(float)duration distance:(float)dis; 函数实现switch 的第一个case：\r\n        case UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait:\r\n            if ([[[UIDevice currentDevice] systemVersion] floatValue] >= 8.0)\r\n            {\r\n                self.frame = CGRectMake(originalRect_.origin.x, originalRect_.origin.y - dis, self.frame.size.width, self.frame.size.height);\r\n            }else{\r\n                self.frame = CGRectMake(originalRect_.origin.x, originalRect_.origin.y - dis, originalRect_.size.width, originalRect_.size.height);\r\n            }\r\n            break;  \r\n改好，经过多机型多轮测试 fix。稍后我会 pull 一个过来。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17745","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17745/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17745/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17745/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17745","id":224051915,"number":17745,"title":"HOW TO DELETE THIS?","user":{"login":"liuyi","id":848803,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/848803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyi","html_url":"https://github.com/liuyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-04-25T07:53:58Z","updated_at":"2017-04-25T09:21:52Z","closed_at":"2017-04-25T09:21:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17745/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17744","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17744/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17744/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17744/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17744","id":224022365,"number":17744,"title":"Has Screenshot!
