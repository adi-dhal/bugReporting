AudioEngine-win32.cpp, the AudioEngineImpl::update is scheduled to be called every 0.05 seconds.  This is done in AudioEngineImpl::play2d, via the following call:\n\n```\n    scheduler->schedule(schedule_selector(AudioEngineImpl::update), this, 0.05f, false);\n```\n\nThe AudioEngineImpl layer uses its own audio state, which becomes out of sync with the true state of the audio source being played via the OpenAL layer.\n\nThis causes a problem with any method that is called with an the audio ID provided by the play2d method. For example, calling AudioEngine::getCurrentTime(audioID) should return the current position of the audio source being played.  This works fine until OpenAL gets to the end of the audio source, where the OpenAL state of the audio becomes AL_STOPPED, yet the AudioEngine state for that specific audio file is still set to AudioState::PLAYING, since the AudioEngineImpl::update method has not yet been called to update this state (given it is only called every 0.05 seconds).\n\nThis results in an invalid value of 0.0 being returned by AudioEngine::getCurrentTime(audioID), since the AudioEngineImpl::update code has not yet been called to update the true status of this audioID.\n\nThere are several ways to fix this, and a few that I can think of at the moment are as follows:\n\n(1) Set the AudioEngineImpl::update function to be called called every frame instead of every 0.05 seconds.  \n\n(2) If updating every frame causes performance issues, then modify each method that performs actions against a specific audioID in order to check for the correct OpenAL state of that audio source.  This is not the preferred way to handle the issue, since the AudioEngine state and the OpenAL state will still be out of sync, which may cause other issues when using the AudioEngine. An example of this modification would be as follows:\n\n```\nfloat AudioEngineImpl::getCurrentTime(int audioID)\n{\n    float ret = 0.0f;\n    auto& player = _audioPlayers[audioID];\n    if(player._ready){\n        if (player._streamingSource) {\n            ret = player.getTime();\n        } else {\n            ALint sourceState;\n            alGetSourcei(player._alSource, AL_SOURCE_STATE, &sourceState);\n            // Check the OpenAL state of the source, and if it has finished, return the correct value\n            if (sourceState == AL_STOPPED)\n            {\n                ret = 1.0f;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                alGetSourcef(player._alSource, AL_SEC_OFFSET, &ret);\n            }\n\n            auto error = alGetError();\n            if (error != AL_NO_ERROR) {\n                log(\"%s, audio id:%d,error code:%x\", __FUNCTION__,audioID,error);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    return ret;\n}\n```\n\n(3) Perhaps a secondary and more efficient update method should be added to the implementation that is called per frame, and which simply checks the OpenAL state of any audio source currently playing, and sets the correct AudioEngine::AudioState for that audio source.  This would keep the states in sync.  The AudioEngineImpl::update function would then still be called every 0.05 seconds, and checks the current audio source state values (AudioEngine::AudioState), and removes them from the list if they are no longer in PLAYING state.  A new state would need to be added to the AudioEngine::AudioState enum, being \"STOPPED\" state.  Every method called against an audioID can then check for the AudioState of that audio source, instead of checking the OpenAL state (as suggested in (2) above).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15419/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15418","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15418/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15418/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15418/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15418","id":147946124,"number":15418,"title":"Apple
