suggest we use `fstat()` instead of `fseek()` and `ftell()` when getting the size of a file, for the following reasons:\n1. `FileUtils::getContents()` uses `fseek()` and `ftell()` to get the file size, but `fseek(fp, 0, SEEK_END)` has no portability for a binary stream, and the code is not secure. (for more details, please see **NOTE** below)\n2. `fstat()` is faster than `fseek()` and `ftell()`— concretely, it is around 1000 times faster on my Mac — because `fseek()` is not a system call, but a library function. `fstat()` is a system call and likely to be _O(1)_.\n3. `fstat()` is not the C/C++ standard, it's [part of the POSIX standard](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fstat.html); nevertheless it works well on all target platforms which include Linux, Mac, Android, iOS and Windows. Actually, the `<sys/stat.h>` has already included at `CCFileUtils.cpp:42`, and indeed Android or Windows platforms don't use `FileUtils::getContents()` in favour of a platform-specific implementation (platform-overrides) such as `FileUtilsAndroid::getContents()` or `FileUtilsWin32::getContents()`, so there is no problem.\n#### NOTE\n\nSection 7.19.3.9 of [ISO/IEC 9899:TC2](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf) says:\n\n> 228) Setting the file position indicator to end-of-file, as with fseek(file, 0, SEEK_END), **has undefined behavior for a binary stream** (because of possible trailing null characters) or for any stream with state-dependent encoding that does not assuredly end in the initial shift state.\n\nAdditionary, section 7.19.9.2 of [ISO/IEC 9899:TC2](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf) says:\n\n> A binary stream need not meaningfully support fseek calls with a whence value of SEEK_END.\n\nAlso, [std::fseek reference](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/c/fseek) says:\n\n> Binary streams are not required to support SEEK_END, in particular if additional null bytes are output.\n#### Simple performance benchmark\n\n``` cpp\nFileUtils::Status FileUtils::getContents(const std::string& filename, ResizableBuffer* buffer)\n{\n    // ...\n\n    // 1. Use fseek and ftell\n    auto start1 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n    fseek(fp, 0, SEEK_END);\n    size_t size1 = ftell(fp);\n    fseek(fp, 0, SEEK_SET);\n    auto end1 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\n    // 2. Use fstat instead\n    auto start2 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n#if defined(_MSC_VER)\n    auto descriptor = _fileno(fp);\n#else\n    auto descriptor = fileno(fp);\n#endif\n    struct stat statBuf;\n    if (fstat(descriptor, &statBuf) == -1) {\n        return Status::ReadFailed;\n    }\n    size_t size = statBuf.st_size;\n    auto end2 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\n    // Check backward compatibility\n    CC_ASSERT(size1 == size);\n\n    // Performance benchmark\n    static double totalTime1 = 0;\n    static double totalTime2 = 0;\n    totalTime1 += std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::duration<double>>(end1 - start1).count();\n    totalTime2 += std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::duration<double>>(end2 - start2).count();\n    CCLOG(\"(1) = %lf\\n(2) = %lf\", totalTime1, totalTime2);\n\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nThank you for your time and
