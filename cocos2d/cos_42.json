to [Chipmunk's API reference](https://chipmunk-physics.net/release/ChipmunkLatest-API-Reference/group__cp_body.html#gga3581b128fd3e2734952aeac8545fd5caa95e6c8d1ff2714d17bc4f2258407e58d), physical bodies of the type `CP_BODY_TYPE_KINEMATIC` can be moved like bodies of the type `CP_BODY_TYPE_DYNAMIC` by setting an angular or linear velocity. This, however, is not reflected in the engine code since the kinematic bodies are treated as static bodies instead by the `if` statements that were deleted in this pull request. These bodies are not really static bodies, they are kinematic bodies and get set as such in [line 322 of CCPhysicsBody.cpp](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/blob/v3/cocos/physics/CCPhysicsBody.cpp#L322) when `setDynamic(false)` is called.\r\n\r\nIt's also a recurring issue in the forums where developers have been asking how to create and use these kinematic bodies for some time. Threads such as [PhysicsBody: kinematic type](http://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/t/physicsbody-kinematic-type/22218), [How to create Chipmunk Kinematic body?](http://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/t/how-to-create-chipmunk-kinematic-body/30135), and [Is there static and kinematic physics body present in cocos2d-x v3.0 c++?](http://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/t/is-there-static-and-kinematic-physics-body-present-in-cocos2d-x-v3-0-c/18129) serve as an example.\r\n\r\nI think we should be allowed to move these kinematic bodies by setting linear and angular velocities.
