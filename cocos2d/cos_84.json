I use `StringUtils::format()` and `StringUtils::toString()` functions under v3 branch, I need to add `#include \"deprecated/CCString.h\"` into my code, then the `deprecated` directory makes me confused, because the two functions are not deprecated.\n\nAlso according to the [cocos2d.h](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/blob/103bdb3d378554260e8324ac633b5c1fa1d30357/cocos/cocos2d.h#L314-L315):\n\n```\nIt is recommanded that you just inlcude what is needed.\neg. #include \"deprecated/CCString.h\" if you only need cocos2d::__String.\n```\n\nSo I suggest that we should move these function declarations outside of the deprecated header, in the same way as v4-develop changes (commit: https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/commit/497db86977921deeb159527dd91809fe75a36329).\n\nThis PR does the following:\n- Move `StringUtils::format()` and `StringUtils::toString()` from `deprecated/CCString.h` to `base/ccUTF8.h`\n- Add `#include \"base/ccUTF8.h\"` into `CCString.h` to keep the backward compatibility\n- Replace inclusion of deprecated header with `base/ccUTF8.h`\n\nThank you for considering!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15835/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15834","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15834/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15834/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15834/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/15834","id":160033767,"number":15834,"title":"RenderTexture

However, I have no idea why the problem occurs.

(the following URL)\nhttps://github.com/SeanIchikawa/SampleProject/tree/master/CCBTest\n\nThe button of the layer is made by ccbi (ccbi = cocos builder file).\nThe call-back function is referenced to the button by \"Selector\" in the ccbi file.\n\n[About the sample Xcode project]\n- Xcode Project name : CCBTest\n- ccbi file: Resources/simple.ccbi\n- Class file (written about layer) : Classes/SimpleView.h\n\nBecause the problem have not been resolved, so I use Xcode 7.2.1 now.\n\nIf you any idea, please give me. \nThank you for reading my question.

for considering this.
