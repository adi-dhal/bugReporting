cocos2d-x 的头文件有这些问题：\n## 1 搜索路径太多\n\n以 Windows 为例，根据 cocos2d-x/cocos/2d/cocos2d_headers.props 需要搜索的路径有（不包含外部依赖）：\n\n> $(EngineRoot)cocos\n> $(EngineRoot)cocos\\editor-support\n> $(EngineRoot)cocos\\platform\n> $(EngineRoot)cocos\\platform\\desktop\n\n虽然这样内部使用没有问题，但是影响其他项目中使用 cocos 头文件。\n\n完全可以 **只搜索 `$(EngineRoot)cocos** 嘛。其他的就在这个路径上的相对路径进行包含就好了。\n单一搜索路径的好处是便于设置编译：比如我要弄一个 Lua 模块，依赖 cocos 的 C++ 代码。我只要设置一个搜索路径就好了。\n## 2 没有区分内部和公开头文件\n\n目前没有独立的 include 目录，在代码变迁过程中难免出现有人不小心直接 `#include \"abc.h\"` 而不是用 `#include \"relative/path/to/abc.h\"`。\n\n比如 `cocos/scripting/lua-bindings/manual/CCLuaBridge.h` 中就直接这样包含的： `#include \"CCLuaEngine.h\"` 这样导致第三方工程需要引用 `#include \"scripting/lua-bindings/manual/CCLuaBridge.h\"` 的时候，不得不把 `cocos/scripting/lua-bindings/manual` 添加到搜索路径里面。这样有加重了前面第1点。\n\n这里的问题就是，没有区分内部头文件和导出的外部头文件。\n\n如果`scripting/lua-bindings/manual/CCLuaEngine.h` 是公开 API，那么就应`scripting/lua-bindings/manual/CCLuaBridge.h`该使用`#include \"scripting/lua-bindings/manual/CCLuaEngine.h\"`。\n如果 CCLuaEngine.h 不是公开的，那么就不该在头文件中引用它，而应该在 cpp 文件中引用。当然如果`CCLuaBridge.h` 也不是公开的，那么可以另当别论。\n\n问题是，现在没有办法通过路径知道到底一个头文件是不是公开的 API。\n\n所以需要 **专门建一个 include 目录放公开的 API 的头文件**。\n## 3  cocos2d-x 内部一股脑地 #include \"cocos2d.h\"\n\n现在 cocos2d-x 内部，只要动一下头文件，几乎是导致整个 cocos 重新编译。元凶就是 `#include \"cocos2d.h\"`。\n\n解决办法就是 **用啥包含啥，不用别包含** 。\n\n`cocos2d.h` 存在的意义就是提供给外部使用，帮助那些不太熟悉 cocos 的开发者，因为他们可能不太清楚，比如要用 Node 该使用哪个头文件。但是严谨的开发者在使用 cocos2d 的时候，不应该使用 `#incude \"cocos2d.h\"` 这样的方式。更不要说 cocos2d 内部代码了。\n\n更糟糕的是，由于前面讲到的 第一二点 的关系，目前 cocos2d-x 的的头文件是在逼开发者在游戏项目中使用 `#incude \"cocos2d.h\"` 。\n## 4 一个头文件里面包含太多内容\n\n比如我想只使用 `platform/CCFileUtils.h` 结果：\n\n> In file included from cocos/platform/CCFileUtils.h:33:\n> In file included from cocos/base/ccTypes.h:36:\n> In file included from cocos/platform/CCGL.h:33:\n> cocos/platform/mac/CCGL-mac.h:32:9: fatal error: 'OpenGL/gl.h' file not found\n\n原因就是 ccTypes.h 定义的和 OpenGL 相关的类型，而这些类型又依赖于 CCGL.h ，进一步要求依赖于 'OpenGL/gl.h'。 于是乎 一个 CCFileUtils 就依赖与 OpenGL 了。\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15249","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15249/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15249/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15249/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15249","id":141055639,"number":15249,"title":"Error
