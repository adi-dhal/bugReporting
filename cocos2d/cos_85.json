simulator maybe hang when i use it on mac platform.\nwhen i output a large log, the simulator hang.\nI checked the code and found that simulator use NSPipe to redirect log to textview.but, the readend and writeend of pipe in the same thread.\n\nThink about it.  What does NSFileHandle do when it has read some data in the background?  It queues up a message for the main thread (or whatever thread you did the -readInBackgroundAndNotify from) to handle the data. \n\nNow, what is your main thread doing?  Well, it's writing to stdout.  It is definitely not prepared to handle the notification from NSFileHandle -- that is, it's not sitting idle in the run loop.  So, it has ceased asking NSFileHandle to read from the pipe.  So, eventually, the script is going to fill whatever buffer there is.\n\nthe following is my suggestion and solution:\nMaybe, we should arrange to execute the two things on independent threads of execution, or even processes.

Env: VS2015, Windows7.1\n\nAfter update the libwebsocket lib for IPv6, program would crash when initialize websocket (lws_create_context). I think the reason is that websockets.lib is compiled by VS2013. Through VS2015 can link the lib, but the VS2015 and 2013 use different CRT may cause crash.\nI use VS2015 compile libwebsocket.lib to work around this issue.
