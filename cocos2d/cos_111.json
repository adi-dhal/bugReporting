cocos2d developer\n\nRecently, I encountered a problem which was about changing texture of a Sprite3D.\n`setTexture` method of Sprite3D you have provided, changes texture of every mesh in Sprite3D, and this is not what we expected.\n\nI mean, there should be a way to change the texture of specific mesh. \nWhile I trace deep into native code, I found out that CCMesh declared `setTexture` method which was using polymorphism, and thus made you skip binding them to the javascript.\n\nI strongly suggest that this requirement should be added officially.\nex :\n`mySprite3D.getMeshByName(\"card\").setTextureByFile(\"res/card.png\");`\n\nThanks in
