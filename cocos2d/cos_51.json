Currently we have been getting quite a lot crash logs caused by this.\r\n\r\nA straight forward fix for this is to add a mutex but this will require a lot of change in the code, and will cause much overhead for programs that mainly use FileUtils in main thread.\r\n\r\nThere's a much easier solution to this(only change 2 lines): \r\n\r\n> Add a [`thread_local`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/keyword/thread_local) specifier for the `FileUtils::s_sharedFileUtils`\r\n\r\nThis makes each thread that uses FileUtils have their own instances.\r\n\r\nIf an app does not use FileUtils in multiple threads, then `getInstance` will only be called in main thread and only main thread will hold a FileUtils instance so it will behave exactly the same as the current implementation.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think, I can create a PR right after.
