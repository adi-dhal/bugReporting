have no sound in my desktop mac os x app. I'm using cocos2d-x 3.8.1, latest xcode. And precompiled libs. Works fine without precompiled cocos2d-x lib. \nWhen I'm launching app I'm getting following error in logs:\n\n```\nobjc[24880]: Class AVAudioPlayer is implemented in both /System/Library/Frameworks/AVFoundation.framework/Versions/A/Resources/libAVFAudio.dylib and /Users/piotr/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Numbers-acakhypszguotnfnicnqatbksbxl/Build/Products/Debug/Numbers-desktop.app/Contents/MacOS/Numbers-desktop. One of the two will be used. Which one is undefined.\n```\n\nSo I've removed AVFoundation.framework from desktop target. Project still compiles and error is gone. However still no sound. I'm using SimpleAudioEngine to play sounds.\n\nAfter debugging I found out here's a problem:\n\nunsigned int SimpleAudioEngine::playEffect(const char *pszFilePath, bool bLoop,\n                                           float pitch, float pan, float gain)\n{\n    // Changing file path to full path\n    std::string fullPath = FileUtils::getInstance()->fullPathForFilename(pszFilePath);\n    return static_playEffect(fullPath.c_str(), bLoop, pitch, pan, gain);\n}\n\nfullPath is an empty string.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14353/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14352","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14352/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14352/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14352/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14352","id":116063783,"number":14352,"title":"[Web engine] Removed node may still be hold by actions and cause memory leak","user":{"login":"pandamicro","id":632460,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/632460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro","html_url":"https://github.com/pandamicro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":228340541,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/labels/platform:web","name":"platform:web","color":"fbca04","default":false},{"id":254494947,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/labels/type:memory","name":"type:memory","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-11-10T08:53:34Z","updated_at":"2016-08-01T03:24:41Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"A developer reported that when removing a node from the scene, if it has some actions attached, the action will cause the node still reachable from ActionManager, then it won't be collected by GC.\n\nIn the engine logic, normally, when a node detached from the scene, the cleanup should be called recursively from itself to its children node tree.

played at startup will stop.\n\nThat's because this function seems working wrong:\n\n```\n    int sourceIndex = [self _getSourceIndexForSourceGroup:sourceGroupId];\n```\n\nI don't understand how exactly _getSourceIndexForSourceGroup:sourceGroupId works so I've added simple fix after this line:\n\n```\n    for(int i = 0; i < sourceTotal_; i++){\n        ALint state;\n        ALuint source = _sources[i].sourceId;\n        alGetSourcei(source, AL_SOURCE_STATE, &state);\n        if (state != AL_PLAYING && state != AL_PAUSED) {\n            sourceIndex = i;\n            break;\n        }\n
