audio pause/resume logic on iOS will be controlled automatically.\nBoth `SimpleAudioEngine` & `New AudioEngine` on iOS achieve in that way, but other platforms are not implemented. So developers have to invoke `AudioEngine::pauseAll/resumeAll` in the Applegate.cpp, some code like:\n\n``` c++\n// This function will be called when the app is inactive. Note, when receiving a phone call it is invoked.\nvoid AppDelegate::applicationDidEnterBackground() {\n    Director::getInstance()->stopAnimation();\n\n    // if you use SimpleAudioEngine, it must be paused\n    SimpleAudioEngine::getInstance()->pauseBackgroundMusic();\n    SimpleAudioEngine::getInstance()->pauseAllEffects();\n    // if using new audio engine\n    AudioEngine::pauseAll();\n}\n\n// this function will be called when the app is active again\nvoid AppDelegate::applicationWillEnterForeground() {\n    Director::getInstance()->startAnimation();\n\n    // if you use SimpleAudioEngine, it must resume here\n    SimpleAudioEngine::getInstance()->resumeBackgroundMusic();\n    SimpleAudioEngine::getInstance()->resumeAllEffects();\n   // if using new audio engine\n   AudioEngine::resumeAll();\n}\n```\n\nDevelopers are confused, they complain that why should we invoke these method for Android while their games run perfectly on iOS.\n\nAny thoughts about this? Should we implement the same automatic `pause/resume` strategy for all platforms?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16215/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16214","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16214/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16214/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16214/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/16214","id":167509807,"number":16214,"title":"fixed #16169: new android project crash in android 5.0.2 device (Nexus 7) when use 3.12","user":{"login":"dumganhar","id":493372,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/493372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dumganhar","html_url":"https://github.com/dumganhar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dumganhar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dumganhar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dumganhar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dumganhar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dumganhar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dumganhar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dumganhar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dumganhar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dumganhar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/milestones/29","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/milestone/29","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/milestones/29/labels","id":1768287,"number":29,"title":"3.13","description":"","creator":{"login":"minggo","id":488203,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/488203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo","html_url":"https://github.com/minggo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minggo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":169,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-05-16T09:52:30Z","updated_at":"2016-08-29T07:25:14Z","due_on":"2016-08-29T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-08-29T07:25:14Z"},"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-07-26T02:47:52Z","updated_at":"2016-07-28T03:19:26Z","closed_at":"2016-07-28T03:19:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pulls/16214","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/16214","diff_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/16214.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/16214.patch"},"body":"While using clang compiler with gnustl_static on android, the copy assignment operator of `std::u16string` will affect the memory validity, it means after `newChars` is destroyed, the memory of `u16Text` holds will be a dead region. `u16text` represents the variable in `Label::_utf16Text`, when somewhere allocates memory by `malloc, realloc, new, new[]`, the generated memory address may be the same as `Label::_utf16Text` holds.
