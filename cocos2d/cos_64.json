title says what this is about: I have copied the audio engine for Windows to Linux and made it work. I did this because the Windows implementation uses OpenAL instead of FMOD and\nit was quite strange to me that Linux uses a proprietary audio library, while every other platform uses the open one. Also, I think that the audio engine is easier to maintain when every platform uses the same API.\n\nI was surprised that this was such an easy job because I only needed to copy the source files, change every \"Win32\" to \"Linux\" and tell CMake to link against these libraries. I wonder why no one did this before. Anyway, why was the audio engine implemented with FMOD and not with OpenAL?\n\nI also updated the installation script, but the deps-archive still contains FMOD. It would be really nice if someone could remove it when this get merged.\n\nEDIT: The test failed since the dependencies for linux have changed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16409","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16409/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16409/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16409/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/16409","id":172276139,"number":16409,"title":"#Improve RichText::createWithXml performance.","user":{"login":"halx99","id":6977319,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6977319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/halx99","html_url":"https://github.com/halx99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/halx99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/halx99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/halx99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/halx99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/halx99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/halx99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/halx99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/halx99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/halx99/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":203599624,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/labels/module:ui","name":"module:ui","color":"207de5","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"ricardoquesada","id":232330,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/232330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada","html_url":"https://github.com/ricardoquesada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"ricardoquesada","id":232330,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/232330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada","html_url":"https://github.com/ricardoquesada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardoquesada/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2016-08-20T15:28:35Z","updated_at":"2016-08-23T02:00:05Z","closed_at":"2016-08-23T02:00:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pulls/16409","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/16409","diff_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/16409.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/16409.patch"},"body":"# Improve RichText::createWithXml performance with real XML SAX parser.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4746","x-ratelimit-reset":"1506844633","x-github-request-id":"B1F4:110B:10F3172:3D75DF8:59D09D79","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=65>;
