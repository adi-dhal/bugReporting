current implementation of (native/runtime)CCAudio supports only play local files. This brings limitation to runtime game development. On runtime, developers have to implement some sort of preloading mechanism to insure remote sound assets are locally available to CC prior to playing them. Such an implement could easily lead to problems:\n- developers’ code bases have to be differentiated for native / runtime / html5  \n- It requires careful queue management for assets preloading, otherwise it may crash the game.\n\n目前 native/runtime 的 CCAuido 还不支持直接play 一个 url， 因此开发者需要自建预载队列管理。而 runtime 下的预载队列管理需要比较精细的实现，不然很容易让游戏产品出现异常。因此将导致 runtime 下的产品的开发难度增加。 \n\n[Suggestion]\nI suggest CCAudio on native/runtime to provde same functionality as CCAudio implementation on H5, that could take an url as input parameter, and to play the remote asset from that given url.\n\n我希望建议 native/runtime 的 CCAuido  和 h5下的 CCAuido 提供相同的参数接口，可以直接接受一个 url来播放远程素材。这样可以大大简化开发者层面对  CCAuido  的使用。\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15501/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15500","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15500/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15500/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15500/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/15500","id":150729582,"number":15500,"title":"Fix

can't read binary file, and it truncate contents.\n3. `FileUtils::getDataFormFile()` and `FileUtils::getStringFormFile()` does not tell different from empty file and io errors.\n\nAdvantage of `FileUtils::getContents()`\n1. Support read into `cocos2d::Data` `std::basic_string` and `std::vector`\n2. It has abstract of the output buffer, custom type of buffer object can be adapted by writing subclass `ResizableBuffer`.\n3. It returns error code, so that we can know the different form empty file and io error.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15479/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15478","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15478/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15478/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15478/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/15478","id":149954214,"number":15478,"title":"[ci skip][AUTO]: updating luabinding & jsbinding automatically","user":{"login":"CocosRobot","id":990131,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/990131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CocosRobot","html_url":"https://github.com/CocosRobot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CocosRobot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CocosRobot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CocosRobot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CocosRobot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CocosRobot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CocosRobot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CocosRobot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CocosRobot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CocosRobot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-04-21T03:37:03Z","updated_at":"2016-04-21T07:41:10Z","closed_at":"2016-04-21T07:41:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pulls/15478","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/15478","diff_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/15478.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/15478.patch"},"body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15478/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15477","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15477/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15477/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15477/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/15477","id":149936541,"number":15477,"title":"[ci skip][AUTO]: updating luabinding & jsbinding automatically","user":{"login":"CocosRobot","id":990131,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/990131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CocosRobot","html_url":"https://github.com/CocosRobot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CocosRobot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CocosRobot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CocosRobot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CocosRobot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CocosRobot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CocosRobot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CocosRobot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CocosRobot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CocosRobot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-04-21T01:54:51Z","updated_at":"2016-04-21T01:55:52Z","closed_at":"2016-04-21T01:55:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pulls/15477","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/15477","diff_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/15477.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/15477.patch"},"body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4715","x-ratelimit-reset":"1506844633","x-github-request-id":"E274:028A:1B05381:2F55DE8:59D09E63","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=96>;
