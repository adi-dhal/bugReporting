PR provides a fix for issue #15439.\n\nAs detailed in the issue, the crash is caused by multiple references to the static `__indices[]` array and the invalidation of these references when this cache is expanded with `realloc()`.\n\nRather than simply expanding, new memory is allocated to `__indicies[]` and references to any previous `__indicies` are captured by the `QuadCommand` for the duration of its lifetime. The triangle indices used by the `Renderer` are now guaranteed to be valid at the point copying the GL buffer.\n\nThe proposed fix will result in a slightly higher amount of memory usage whenever the shared indices buffer grows but will eventually stabilise (assuming no references to the `QuadCommand` are kept from deallocating).\n\nMaybe a larger refactor for dealing with the shared memory should be considered but this is a fairly low impact fix which should at least stop the crashes!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15646/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15645","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15645/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15645/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15645/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/15645","id":154875106,"number":15645,"title":"Refactor
