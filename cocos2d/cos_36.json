When you initialize the font with constructor and don't change font size it works fine, but when you change font size, his texture coordinates back to the zero position.

If you change the font size of the texture coordinates will melt Vec2 :: ZERO.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid Label::setBMFontSizeInternal(float fontSize)\r\n{\r\n    if(_currentLabelType == LabelType::BMFONT){\r\n        this->setBMFontFilePath(_bmFontPath, Vec2::ZERO, fontSize);\r\n        _contentDirty = true;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn my case the solution was to change the function that creates the Label.\r\nYour function:\r\n```\r\nLabel* Label::createWithBMFont(const std::string& bmfontFilePath, const std::string& text,const TextHAlignment& hAlignment /* = TextHAlignment::LEFT */, int maxLineWidth /* = 0 */, const Vec2& imageOffset /* = Vec2::ZERO */)\r\n{\r\n    auto ret = new (std::nothrow) Label(hAlignment);\r\n    if (ret && ret->setBMFontFilePath(bmfontFilePath,imageOffset))\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nto:\r\n```\r\nLabel* Label::createWithBMFont(const std::string& bmfontFilePath, const std::string& text,const TextHAlignment& hAlignment /* = TextHAlignment::LEFT */, int maxLineWidth /* = 0 */, const Vec2& imageOffset /* = Vec2::ZERO */, float fontSize)\r\n{\r\n    auto ret = new (std::nothrow) Label(hAlignment);\r\n   if (ret && ret->setBMFontFilePath(bmfontFilePath,imageOffset, fontSize))\r\n   ...\r\n```\r\nCan you solve this problem.

Because the code does:\r\n\r\n`        (type == GL_VERTEX_SHADER ? \"precision highp float;\\n precision highp int;\\n\" : \"precision mediump float;\\n precision mediump int;\\n\"),\r\n`\r\n\r\nWhile this works fine on most devices it fails for some GPUs and devices because the GLSL spec says that uniform precisions in vertex and fragment shaders should match. Check this issue in another github project that discusses this part of GLSL spec:\r\n  https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/817\r\n\r\n> Do precision qualifiers for uniforms need to match?\r\n> Option 1: Yes.\r\n> Uniforms are defined to behave as if they are using the same storage in the vertex and fragment processors and may be implemented this way.\r\n> If uniforms are used in both the vertex and fragment shaders, developers should be warned if the precisions are different. Conversion of precision should never be implicit.\r\n> Option 2: No.\r\n> Uniforms may be used by both shaders but the same precision may not be available in both so there is a justification for allowing them to be different.\r\n> Using the same uniform in the vertex and fragment shaders will always require the precision to be specified in the vertex shader (since the default precision is highp). This is an unnecessary burden on developers.\r\n> RESOLUTION: Yes, precision qualifiers for uniforms must match.\r\n> \r\n\r\n**A possible solution:**\r\n\r\nCan we just define all these uniforms to be mediump? Or are they likely to need highp precision in some uses cases?\r\n\r\n```\r\nstatic const char * COCOS2D_SHADER_UNIFORMS =\r\n        \"uniform mediump mat4 CC_PMatrix;\\n\"\r\n        \"uniform mediump mat4 CC_MVMatrix;\\n\"\r\n        \"uniform mediump mat4 CC_MVPMatrix;\\n\"\r\n        \"uniform mediump mat3 CC_NormalMatrix;\\n\"\r\n        \"uniform mediump vec4 CC_Time;\\n\"\r\n        \"uniform mediump vec4 CC_SinTime;\\n\"\r\n        \"uniform mediump vec4 CC_CosTime;\\n\"\r\n        \"uniform mediump vec4 CC_Random01;\\n\"\r\n        \"uniform sampler2D CC_Texture0;\\n\"\r\n        \"uniform sampler2D CC_Texture1;\\n\"\r\n        \"uniform sampler2D CC_Texture2;\\n\"\r\n        \"uniform sampler2D CC_Texture3;\\n\"\r\n        \"//CC INCLUDES END\\n\\n\";\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI started a discussion on this on Mali forums:\r\n  https://community.arm.com/graphics/f/discussions/150/this-very-simple-shader-fails-to-link-on-only-some-mali-gpus/187\r\n\r\nAnother post discussing this issue with Mali GPUs and suggesting a #ifndef condition as solution.
