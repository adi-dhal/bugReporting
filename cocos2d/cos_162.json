i know on iOS app should not perform any work with OpenGL after call of _applicationWillResignActive_.\n\nIf i understood correctly, work with opengl in cocos stopped and resumed by:\n\n```\nDirector::getInstance()->stopAnimation();\nDirector::getInstance()->startAnimation();\n```\n\nBut these method called respectively by:\n\n```\n- (void)applicationDidEnterBackground:(UIApplication *)application;\n- (void)applicationWillEnterForeground:(UIApplication *)application;\n```\n\nBut _applicationDidEnterBackground_ called after a small delay after _applicationWillResignActive_. So it may be too late to stop use OpenGL.\n\nAlso, when user receive a call, double click home button or buying IAP - _applicationWillResignActive_ always called, but _applicationDidEnterBackground_ may not be called. And i think the game should be paused in these situations.\n\nPreviously i have worked with SpriteKit and it crushed on iOS 7 if not to call SKView.pause() in _applicationWillResignActive_. Seems like i have received similar crash reports in cocos2d-x in iOS 7 (unfortunately i don't have iOS 7 device and can't reproduce these issues on simulator).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13473","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13473/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13473/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13473/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/13473","id":101920972,"number":13473,"title":"Updated Windows 10 UWP requirements in readme","user":{"login":"stammen","id":1226490,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1226490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stammen","html_url":"https://github.com/stammen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stammen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stammen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stammen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stammen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stammen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stammen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stammen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stammen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stammen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-08-19T15:33:05Z","updated_at":"2015-08-20T18:34:15Z","closed_at":"2015-08-20T05:48:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pulls/13473","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/13473","diff_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/13473.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/13473.patch"},"body":"This pull request updatesWindows 10 UWP requirements in the readme.
