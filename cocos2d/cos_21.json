This will allow us to avoid several lambda copy constructor calls, and improve performance in the engine around some of our multi-threading APIs. \r\n\r\nThis change should be backwards compatible, and not break current API*. This change should not introduce any additional net copy constructor calls, and should overall reduce the number of copy constructor calls for lambda functions in the engine. \r\n\r\n\\* Before AsyncTaskPool::enqueue was based off a generic parameter T, however we were assuming that T implemented operator() accepting no arguments. Internally in the engine, the parameter T could be trivially switched to std::function<void()>.

issue:**\r\n* create timer with some repeat count\r\nScheduler::schedule(callback, target, interval, repeat, delay, paused, key);\r\n* wait for last repeat executed\r\n* in timer callback reschedule it again with the same key\r\n* as result timer is broken and will never be executed\r\n\r\n**Reason:**\r\nWhen we reschedule timer again from callback the scheduler just updates interval value:\r\n`timer->setInterval(interval);`\r\n\r\nAfter callback executed timer will be canceled:\r\n```\r\nif (!_runForever && _timesExecuted > _repeat)\r\n{    //unschedule timer\r\n    cancel();\r\n    return;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Fix:**\r\nScheduler will update interval only for not exhausted timers (still running).\r\nIn our case, it will create new internal timer object and old one will be canceled after callback.\r\n\r\nThe same fix I did for cocos2d-html5 here
