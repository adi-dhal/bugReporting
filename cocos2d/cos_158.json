It is called through by `Cocos2dxActivity.onWindowFocusChanged()`.\n\nI found a case that `onWindowFocusChanged()` is not being called after `onResume()`. It causes the app to freeze.\n\nNormally `onWindowFocusChanged(false)` is called right after `onPause()` and `onWindowFocusChanged(true)` right after `onResume()`.\nBut if the device's display is turned off by itself because of screen timeout, a time gap is generated between `onPause()` and `onWindowFocusChanged(false)` like following. In this case, It took 7 seconds. Test device was Samsung Galaxy S4(SHV-E300S).\n\n```\n08-27 16:39:42.561: D/Cocos2dxActivity(26545): onPause()\n08-27 16:39:49.646: D/Cocos2dxActivity(26545): onWindowFocusChanged() hasFocus=false\n08-27 16:39:52.761: D/Cocos2dxActivity(26545): onResume()\n08-27 16:39:53.166: D/Cocos2dxActivity(26545): onWindowFocusChanged() hasFocus=true\n```\n\nIf user turns on the display in the time gap right after `onPause()`, `onResume()` is called right then. It leads `onWindowFocusChanged(true)` not to be called because the activity hasn't lose focus.\n\n```\n08-27 16:40:09.651: D/Cocos2dxActivity(26545): onPause()\n08-27 16:40:10.586:
