Guys!\nI just found that the `_defaultFBO` property (a FrameBuffer) on the `CCDirector` class is not fully deallocated. I was trying to integrate UIKit with the latest Cocos2d-x v3.8 and everything was fine but re-assign the CCEAGLView.\nThis bug is because the `FrameBuffer` has two static variables:\n\n``` cpp\nFrameBuffer* FrameBuffer::_defaultFBO = nullptr;\nstd::set<FrameBuffer*> FrameBuffer::_frameBuffers;\n```\n\nand they need to be cleared when you re-assign the CCEAGLView.   \n\nso i added two things:\n\nFirst on **`CCFrameBuffer`** class [added the following method](https://github.com/rauluranga/Cocos2dx-UIKit/blob/master/cocos2d/cocos/renderer/CCFrameBuffer.cpp#L295):\n\n``` cpp\n// .\n// .\n// .\nvoid FrameBuffer::clean() {\n    if(_defaultFBO)\n    {\n        _defaultFBO = nullptr;\n    }\n    _frameBuffers.clear();\n}\n```\n\nand the corresponding [header declaration](https://github.com/rauluranga/Cocos2dx-UIKit/blob/master/cocos2d/cocos/renderer/CCFrameBuffer.h#L199)\n\n``` cpp\n// .\n// .\n// .\npublic:\n    static FrameBuffer* getOrCreateDefaultFBO(GLView* glView);\n    static void clean();\n```\n\nLast on **`CCDirector`** class deconstructor [make the call](https://github.com/rauluranga/Cocos2dx-UIKit/blob/master/cocos2d/cocos/base/CCDirector.cpp#L188-190) and release `_defaultFBO` property instead of delete:\n\n``` cpp\n   //CC_SAFE_DELETE(_defaultFBO);\n    CC_SAFE_RELEASE(_defaultFBO);\n    experimental::FrameBuffer::clean();\n```\n\ni don't know if this is the best way to solve it, but it just works!\n\nfinal
