winRT (checked from cocos3.3 to 3.6), there is a bug in the PreloadSoundEffect function that prevent it from find the sound resource if using FileUtils searchPaths.\n\nMy resources folder looks like this:\nResources/common\nResources/lowres\nResources/highres\n\nIn common, I store all resolution-independant files, and lowres/highres speaks for themselves.\nDuring game init, I setup my search paths using FileUtils::getInstance()->setSearchPaths(searchPath);\nI always add \"common\", then add either lowres or highres.\n\nProblem is (winRT only, works fine on iOS/MacOS/Android/Win32), the PreloadSoundEffect function of winRT does not use the FileUtils searchpaths, it's only looking inside the base \"Resources\" folder.\n(I try to load \"sfx/effect.wav\", on other platforms it correctly find it in \"Resources/common/sfx/effect.wav\" but on winRT it only search in \"Resources/sfx/effect.wav\").\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12544/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12543","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12543/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12543/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12543/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12543","id":90961428,"number":12543,"title":"Refactor

web engine is now managed by a dependency config file (moduleConfig.json) and a poor script insertion mechanism. AMD/CMD module management will be great for the web engine to manage module dependencies. \n## Essential benefits\n1. User and the engine itself can profit from module management feature.\n2. It can help user to build up their own web workflow and easily combine cocos with other frameworks.\n3. The granularity of modules can be greatly reduced, the result is that a web package can be very small.\n4. Avoid global variable pollution, reduce variables in some namespaces.\n## Proposed solution\n- [ ] Choose between require.js or CMD solution (like sea.js). AMD is more web friendly with asynchronous feature, but CMD have more compact API and usage.\n- [ ] Create a tool based on gulp or `r.js` directly to package all js files into one file and obfuscate the js file.\n- [ ] Refactor CCBoot.js to support two ways of dependency management (The old one and the new one).\n- [ ] Keep compatibility with old versions.\n- [ ] Refactor engine's core module with the new module management system.\n## IMPORTANT\n\nSHOULDN'T AFFECT
