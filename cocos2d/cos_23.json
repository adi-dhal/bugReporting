cocos2d-x team!\r\n\r\nQuite a long time ago, you guys announced a [new renderer pipeline roadmap](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/wiki/Cocos2d_v30_renderer_pipeline_roadmap). So far, I can see that the main structure is already functional for the cocos2dx version I'm working with (v3.13). However, some of the major features are still missing, like the full featured command keys:\r\n\r\n![alt text][logo]\r\n\r\n[logo]: http://www.cocos2d-x.org/attachments/download/5084 \"RenderCommand keys\"\r\n\r\nThe current sorting by `globalZOrder` works fine and already gives a nice performance improvement (see code below). However, all other nodes that have `globalZOrder = 0` (including all `Widget` classes) still use the [old rendering optimization highly dependent on `Node` hierarchy](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-objc/wiki/Cocos2D-Render-Order-and-Batching):\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nvoid RenderQueue::sort()\r\n{\r\n    // Don't sort _queue0, it already comes sorted\r\n    std::sort(std::begin(_commands[QUEUE_GROUP::TRANSPARENT_3D]), std::end(_commands[QUEUE_GROUP::TRANSPARENT_3D]), compare3DCommand);\r\n    std::sort(std::begin(_commands[QUEUE_GROUP::GLOBALZ_NEG]), std::end(_commands[QUEUE_GROUP::GLOBALZ_NEG]), compareRenderCommand);\r\n    std::sort(std::begin(_commands[QUEUE_GROUP::GLOBALZ_POS]), std::end(_commands[QUEUE_GROUP::GLOBALZ_POS]), compareRenderCommand);\r\n}\r\n\r\nstatic bool compareRenderCommand(RenderCommand* a, RenderCommand* b)\r\n{\r\n    return a->getGlobalOrder() < b->getGlobalOrder();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n![alt text][nodes]\r\n\r\n[nodes]: https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ed2f14db7ae31400107bd6f2831d0e570bfaa920/687474703a2f2f66696c65732e736c656d62636b652e6e65742f74656d702f436f636f73324452656e6465724f726465722e737667 \"Old drawing order, hierarchy dependent\"\r\n\r\nI'd like to know how this roadmap is going, what you still plan to do and what have you discarded.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17643/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17642","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17642/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17642/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17642/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17642","id":219111947,"number":17642,"title":"Android application crash using the latest code -- EGL_BAD_ATTRIBUTE","user":{"login":"Rubonnek","id":8337880,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/8337880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rubonnek","html_url":"https://github.com/Rubonnek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rubonnek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rubonnek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rubonnek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rubonnek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rubonnek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rubonnek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rubonnek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rubonnek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rubonnek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-04-04T01:05:27Z","updated_at":"2017-04-10T07:02:23Z","closed_at":"2017-04-10T07:02:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"- cocos2d-x version: v3.15, git commit acc97516d8 plus patch #17641\r\n- devices test on: LG G3 Stylus - Android 5.0.2\r\n- developing environments\r\n   - NDK version: r14b\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.
