like the refactoring of the 2D physics wrapper has resulted in changes to the mass, moment and size of shapes. \n\nI haven't figured out the root cause of this issue, but this discussion shows before and after images from upgrading from 3.8.1 to 3.9beta0. In 3.8.1 the mass and moment of the vehicle were tuned so that the torque applied to the wheels would make the vehicle move responsively and the shapes and sprites were adjusted to properly model the race car. But after upgrading to 3.9beta0 the car barely moves as if the mass or moment drastically increased and the wheel shapes are much larger than the sprites.\n\nNo changes were made to the game source code other than upgrading from 3.8.1 to 3.9.\n\nhttp://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/t/cocos2d-x-3-9-beta0-released/24507/24\n\nHere is some code showing how I create some of the vehicle shapes:\n\n```\nvoid RaceCar::setupVehicleBody()\n{\n    _vehicleBody = PhysicsBody::createBox(_config.bodySize);\n    _vehicleBody->setMass(_config.mass);\n\n\n    auto vehicleShape = PhysicsShapeBox::create(_config.bodySize);\n    vehicleShape->setMaterial(_config.material);\n    _vehicleBody->addShape(vehicleShape);\n    _vehicleBody->setMoment(vehicleShape->calculateDefaultMoment() * _config.momentFactor);\n    _vehicleBody->setGravityEnable(true);\n    _vehicleBody->setLinearDamping(_config.linearDamping);\n    _vehicleBody->setAngularDamping(_config.angularDamping);\n    _vehicleBody->setAngularVelocityLimit(_config.angularVelocityLimit);\n\n\n\n    for (int i=0; i<_config.circleShapeCount; i++)\n    {\n        auto material = PhysicsMaterial(_config.circleShapes[i].density,\n                                             _config.circleShapes[i].restitution,\n                                             _config.circleShapes[i].friction);\n        auto shape = PhysicsShapeCircle::create(_config.circleShapes[i].radius, material, _config.circleShapes[i].offset);\n        _vehicleBody->addShape(shape);\n    }\n\n    _vehicleSprite = Sprite::createWithSpriteFrameName(_config.bodySpriteName);\n    _vehicleSprite->setScale(_config.vehicleBodySpriteScale.x, _config.vehicleBodySpriteScale.y);\n    _vehicleSprite->setPosition(_config.startPosition);\n    _vehicleSprite->setPhysicsBody(_vehicleBody);\n    CC_SAFE_RETAIN(_vehicleSprite);\n\n    _vehicleBody->setGroup(_config.collisionGroup);\n\n}\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14265","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14265/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14265/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14265/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/14265","id":114096101,"number":14265,"title":"Fixed AssetsManagerEx bugs","user":{"login":"cpascal","id":2794216,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2794216?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpascal","html_url":"https://github.com/cpascal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpascal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpascal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpascal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpascal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpascal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpascal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpascal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpascal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpascal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-10-29T16:52:19Z","updated_at":"2015-10-29T17:15:59Z","closed_at":"2015-10-29T17:15:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pulls/14265","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/14265","diff_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/14265.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/14265.patch"},"body":"I've tested this code with cpp-tests's AssetsManagerExTest.cpp code.\n\nBUGS 1.

Completely rewrite the slice-9 feature of ui::Scale9Sprite. \n2. Now the Slice sprite uses 16 vertices and 54 indices instead of the old 9 sprite way.\n   The memory consumption is much lower than the previous implementation. And it is also more time efficient.\n3. Fix a bug when scale9sprite shrink smaller than the center stretch area. \n4. Add RenderingType to slice sprite. When Scale9Enable is true, then we have two rendering type here. \n   \n   In Simple mode, the 4 borders are all 0 and the whole sprite will scale horizontally and vertically. In this mode only 1 quad is used to rendering.\n   \n   In Slice mode, it will use 18 triangles to rendering the slice 9 sprite. If the 4 borders are 0,  there still be 18 triangles computed. So choose your RenderingType wisely.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14262","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14262/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14262/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14262/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/14262","id":113963171,"number":14262,"title":"update

was derived from `Layout` and it implemented the features of scrolling and item arrangement from scratch. But the features are already there in `ListView`. So remove those duplicated implementations from `PageView` and make it subclass from `ListView`.\n\nBy this, `PageView` becomes more simplified and maintainable because it considers only paging implementation. And the user experiences regarding scrolling are processed in one place - `ScrollView`.\n\nOne more, page view now has a page indicator which is represented as a list of small
