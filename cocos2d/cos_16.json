cocos2d-x version: 3.15\r\n- devices test on: win32\r\n- developing environments\r\n   - VS version: 2013\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1.  In cocos empty test add content of archive https://www.dropbox.com/s/zut1fdlsvbxid39/cocos_studio_outline_crash.zip?dl=0\r\n into Resources folder (there is scene with label with enabled outline).\r\n2.

Comment `#include \"ExtensionMacros.h\"` in FlatBufferSerialize.h\r\n4. compile and run\r\n\r\nWill crash at reading .csb file.\r\nCaused by updating flatbuffer to 1.5 version with generating new headers by existing fbs files.\r\n\r\nI understand that you closed support of CocosStudio without promise of backward capability, but I don't understand why you need to update flatbuffer. It's used in CocosStudio reader only ( There is no other usages, I'v checked ). If you don't want to support it anymore - remove it. If you still support it keep it working.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17869/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17868","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17868/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17868/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17868/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17868","id":231633099,"number":17868,"title":"Problems with labels loaded from csb file","user":{"login":"piotrros","id":8133606,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8133606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piotrros","html_url":"https://github.com/piotrros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piotrros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piotrros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piotrros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piotrros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piotrros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piotrros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piotrros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piotrros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piotrros/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-05-26T13:53:16Z","updated_at":"2017-06-15T05:44:11Z","closed_at":"2017-06-15T05:44:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- cocos2d-x version: 3.15\r\n\r\nReproduce:\r\nLoad scene made in Cocos Studio.\r\n\r\nIf using custom size, all the labels are aligned on the center.\r\nIf using auto size, all the labels are aligned on the left.\r\nVertical alignment seems to not work at all.\r\nSometimes labels does not show at all. \r\n\r\nMore info here:\r\nhttp://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/t/cocostudio-bug-in-cocos2d-x-3-15/36591/9\r\n\r\nIt works fine in cocos2d-x 3.14.1.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nuse old cocosstudio directory from 3.14.1.\r\n\r\nPlease fix this :) It does not require changing anything in Cocos Studio itself.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17868/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17867","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17867/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17867/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17867/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17867","id":231572974,"number":17867,"title":"End is not working in Android Nougat.","user":{"login":"isairz","id":4544327,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4544327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isairz","html_url":"https://github.com/isairz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isairz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isairz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isairz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isairz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isairz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isairz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isairz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isairz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isairz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-05-26T09:27:24Z","updated_at":"2017-05-30T10:27:14Z","closed_at":"2017-05-30T10:27:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- cocos2d-x version: 3.13.1\r\n- devices test on: Samsung Galaxy S7, LG V20, LG G6\r\n- developing environments\r\n   -
