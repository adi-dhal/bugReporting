have got some performance issue when rendering particles. (5 particle emitter with 500 particle for each would consume 80% percent of CPU on iPhone 6S).\r\n\r\nThe caculations consumes most of the cycles, if we could do this in another thread, it would be much better.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have done this? Have any suggestion?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18219","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18219/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18219/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18219/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18219","id":255199146,"number":18219,"title":"base64Decode 和微信的sdk冲突","user":{"login":"linyouhappy","id":1627891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1627891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linyouhappy","html_url":"https://github.com/linyouhappy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linyouhappy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linyouhappy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linyouhappy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linyouhappy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linyouhappy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linyouhappy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linyouhappy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linyouhappy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linyouhappy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-09-05T08:32:41Z","updated_at":"2017-09-20T03:46:59Z","closed_at":"2017-09-20T03:46:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- cocos2d-x version:3.15\r\n- devices test on:\r\n- developing environments\r\n   - NDK version:\r\n   - Xcode version:\r\n   - VS version:\r\n   - browser type and version:\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\nbase64Decode 和微信的sdk冲突   -all_load\r\n1. \r\n2. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18218","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18218/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18218/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18218/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18218","id":255020842,"number":18218,"title":"cocos2d::Director::getInstance()->pause(); is commented in applicationWillResignActive","user":{"login":"vahagn-noorgames","id":31069521,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/31069521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahagn-noorgames","html_url":"https://github.com/vahagn-noorgames","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahagn-noorgames/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahagn-noorgames/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahagn-noorgames/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahagn-noorgames/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahagn-noorgames/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahagn-noorgames/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahagn-noorgames/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahagn-noorgames/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahagn-noorgames/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-09-04T11:59:38Z","updated_at":"2017-09-04T12:02:09Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- cocos2d-x version: 3.15.1\r\n- devices test on: iPad Pro 9.7 iOS 10.3.2; iPad Air1 iOS 10.0; iPhone7 iOS 10.3.3\r\n- developing environments\r\n   - NDK version:\r\n   - Xcode version: 8.3 (8E162)\r\n   - VS version:\r\n   - browser type and version:\r\n\r\nHere are two methods from the AppController.mm\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-09-04 at 16 00 39](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31069521/30025598-455d9374-918a-11e7-89d3-14e600e8edb8.png)\r\n\r\nThe fact that the method calls of `pause` and `resume` are commented results in issues in logic that is dependent on delta t, for example, `update` methods.
