_toAddedListeners.push_back(listener);\n}\n```\n\n(3). call dispatchEvent \"1\", because event \"1\" is not added to _listenerMap,  so event \"1\" can not be dispatched nor received.\n\nThis can be solve by dispatching the event with some delay.\nI think it would be nice we could raise some warning for such case; by checking when calling function EventDispatcher::dispatchEvent whether any listener inside _toAddedListeners with an event id  == dispatching event if so print out some warning.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13924/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13923","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13923/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13923/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13923/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/13923","id":107142147,"number":13923,"title":"Refine
