This issue only exists after I upgraded my project from Cocos2d-x 3.10 to Cocos2d-x 3.13.1. \r\n\r\nYou can see the problem right in the original js-test project by choosing Label Test section. Here is the result after I added some texts which I used in my game. I did some slight modifications in LabelTest.js on stroke size and stroke color, just to show the problem more clearly.\r\n\r\nP/s: I tried upgrading cocos2d-x to the newest version 3.15.1 but the problem still exists.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-07-28 at 11 38 27
