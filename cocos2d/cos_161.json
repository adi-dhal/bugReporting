using cocos2d 3.7.1. It's recommended in documentation to \"end\" AudioEngine before the app exits, so Here is what I did:\n\n```\nAppDelegate::~AppDelegate() \n{\n    cocos2d::experimental::AudioEngine::end();\n}\n```\n\nBut that line results in an exception being thrown on line 95 of \"AudioEngine-win32.cpp\". On that line AudioEngineThreadPool is trying to join all threads running, to safely exit the application. It's \"std::system_exception\" error, caused by threads not being joinable.\n\n```\nvoid destroy()\n{\n    _running = false;\n    _sleepCondition.notify_all();\n\n    for (int index = 0; index < _numThread; ++index) {\n        _threads[index].join();\n    }\n}           \n```\n\nAfter digging more into the code, I've found this, inside AudioEngineThreadPool constructor (line 65 of same file):\n\n```\n_threads.reserve(_numThread);\n_tasks.reserve(_numThread);\n\nfor (int index = 0; index < _numThread; ++index) {\n    _tasks.push_back(nullptr);\n    _threads.push_back( std::thread( std::bind(&AudioEngineThreadPool::threadFunc,this,index) ) );\n    _threads[index].detach();\n}\n```\n\nOn line 65, all threads are detached, meaning they are no longer joinable. But in destroy function, it tries to join all those threads, even though they are detached aka. non-joinable; Which according to C++ specification should throw system_error exception [[reference]](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/thread/thread/join/)\n\nPotential fixes:\n1. Remove detach from line 65\n2. check if thread is joinable, before joining it on line
