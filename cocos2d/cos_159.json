The Scale9Sprite works weird\n\nbecause the following code:\n- UIScale9Sprite.cpp:526\n  - `if(_capInsets.equals(Rect::ZERO))`\n- UIScale9Sprite.cpp:549\n  - `if(!capInsets.equals(Rect::ZERO))`\n\nFor example, `setInsetLeft/Top/Right/Bottom` methods call `updateWithSprite`.\n(`setInset*` > `updateCapInset` > `setCapInsets` > `updateWithSprite` finally)\nIf a series of `setInset*` method call is happened then\nthe above `if`s will work as an unintended way.\n\nI don't know why those `if` conditions needed exactly, but if they are for\n9-patch functionality then the other condition check should be added such as\n`&& _isPatch9`.\n#### 2. CCTexture2D contains private methods related to 9-patch sprite\n- `isContain9PatchInfo, getSpriteFrameCapInset, removeSpriteFrameCapInset, and addSpriteFrameCapInset`.\n\nDue to this structure there is no way to write and extend the codes that manage `cocos2d::SpriteFrame` as 9-patch sprites manually.\nI think those methods mentioned above would be declared as public.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13560/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13559","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13559/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13559/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13559/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/13559","id":102995065,"number":13559,"title":"[ci skip]Add release note for v3.8","user":{"login":"pandamicro","id":632460,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/632460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro","html_url":"https://github.com/pandamicro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":228338042,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/labels/type:doc","name":"type:doc","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"pandamicro","id":632460,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/632460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro","html_url":"https://github.com/pandamicro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"pandamicro","id":632460,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/632460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro","html_url":"https://github.com/pandamicro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandamicro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/milestones/21","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/milestone/21","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/milestones/21/labels","id":1080167,"number":21,"title":"v3.8","description":"This version is planned to only \"fix existing bugs\" and \"unfinished tasks\".\r\nWe need to improve the quality after a 3D rush in v3.6 and v3.7.
