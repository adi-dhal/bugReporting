create a lot of nodes width physics body bound with joints  in my game, and remove the nodes when their hp=0. A random bug happen when removing the node.It stops at this code:\n        cpSpaceRemoveConstraint(_cpSpace, constraint);\nin CCPhysicsWorld.cpp line.729 with message \"EXC_BAD_ACCESS\"\n\nI searched this problem on google and find this article:http://chipmunk-physics.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=1780\n\nIt seamed that code like this will cause my bug:\ncpSpaceRemoveBody(space, body);\ncpBodyFree(body);\ncpSpaceConstraintRemove(space, constraintAttachedToTheSameBody); // CRASH!\n\nAnd I saw these code in CCPhysicsWorld.cpp:\n\n```\nif(_updateBodyTransform || !_delayAddBodies.empty())\n{\n    _scene->updatePhysicsBodyTransform(_scene->getNodeToParentTransform(), 0, 1.0f, 1.0f);\n    updateBodies();\n    _updateBodyTransform = false;\n}\nelse if (!_delayRemoveBodies.empty())\n{\n    updateBodies();\n}\n\nif (!_delayAddJoints.empty() || !_delayRemoveJoints.empty() || !_delayRemoveBodies.empty())\n{\n    updateJoints();\n}\n```\n\nIt seems that cocos2dx will remove body earlier than joints. Maybe this is the problem.\nI moved codes about body removing in updateBodies() into updateJoints(), after codes of joints removing, and my game works without bug since then.\n\nMaybe I just use cocos2dx in the wrong
