cocos2d-x team. \n\nI'm using cocos2d-x for my 2D platformer project. And the camera system very usefull instead of the parallax system. (believe me) I always use the camera for the player following, backgrounds...etc I'm setting background positions negative values for depth feeling just like that;   \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlM6goPZmpU&feature=youtu.be&t=9s\n\nBut If I set background z positions as negative values , my background sprites are getting smaller as the size. I don't want to that, because I prepare graphics with original size and some graphics are deforming. \n\nI think this feature would be very nice!\n\n```\nmySprite->setPositionZ(-100);\n//and I'm setting fixed size property with like that\nmySprite->setDisablePerspectiveSizeFactor(true);\n```\n\nPlease add that feature in the next version and it's really important feature for me. :( I'm working to do that with crazy hack methods for now. :(((\n\nThank you.

return `double` as the result such as `::fabs(double)`, `::sqrt(double)`, `::sin(double)` and `::cos(double)`. To suppress the warnings, we can use `std::abs(float)` or `::fabsf(float)` etc. instead them.\n\nAlso, this issue affects the performance because it causes unnecessary implicit casting between `float` and `double` such as `cvtss2sd` or `fcvtds`. Actually, I try to reproduce the implicit conversion with the small test case below on my local machine. (Btw, you can try to compile it online [at this site](http://gcc.godbolt.org/).)\n\n**Code:**\n\n``` cpp\n#include <math.h>\n\nfloat length(float x, float y)\n{\n    return sqrt(x * x + y * y);\n}\n```\n\n**Assembly code snippets:**\n\n``` assembly\n# x86, Clang 3.8\ncvtss2sd        %xmm0, %xmm0    # casting double to float\ncallq   sqrt                    # ::sqrt(double)\ncvtsd2ss        %xmm0, %xmm0    # casting float to double\n```\n\n``` assembly\n# ARM, GCC 4.8.2\nfcvtds  d7, s15                 # casting double to float\nfcpyd   d0, d7\nbl      sqrt                    # ::sqrt(double)\nfcpyd   d7, d0\nfcvtsd  s15, d7                 # casting float to double\n```\n\n**Code:**\n\n``` cpp\n#include <cmath>\n\nfloat length(float x, float y)\n{\n    return std::sqrt(x * x + y * y);\n}\n```\n\n**Assembly code snippets:**\n\n``` assembly\n# x86, Clang 3.8\ncallq   std::sqrt(float)\n```\n\n``` assembly\n# ARM, GCC 4.8.2\nfcpys   s0, s15\nbl      std::sqrt(float)\nfcpys   s15, s0\n```\n\nSo this pull request fixes the warnings and avoids overhead of casting `float` to `double` for performance and portability.
