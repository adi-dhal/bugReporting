cocos2d-x version: 3.13.1 (but same on latest)\r\n- devices test on: Windows\r\n\r\nIn my opinion this is more of bad design than a bug. When you call MoveTo::create(Vec2()) it does not preserve z coordinate. It took me a long time to figure out why my 2D animations weren't ordering correctly when placed in a 3D environment.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a BillBoard\r\n2. Add a few 2D Sprites to a billboard, setup z coordinates for all of them\r\n3. setPositionZ() for all sprites on the billboard\r\n4. Call MoveTo::create(Vec2(x,y)) on a few sprites -> all moves to Z coordinate 0 (CCActionInterval.cpp around line 1253)\r\n\r\nSo you ask why not just use MoveTo::create(Vec3)? It becomes really inconvenience as every Vec2 would need to become Vec3(x,y, sprite->getPositionZ()) if you are just trying to move a sprite on the same x-y plane, otherwise the Z coordinate always goes to 0. This messes up the sprite draw orders as sprites in 3D environment is affected by z coordinate and not z-order. This makes MoveTo(Vec2()) pretty useless in 3D unless you don't manage z coordinate at all. So my suggestion is either do not allow MoveTo(Vec2()) on 3D parents or simply just preserve z coordinate when doing 2D MoveTo. I recommend the latter as it would not affect movements in 2D environment, yet still useful for 3D environments.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18158/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18157","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18157/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18157/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18157/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18157","id":249861464,"number":18157,"title":"Can't push same scene again","user":{"login":"v1993","id":16255906,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/16255906?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/v1993","html_url":"https://github.com/v1993","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v1993/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v1993/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v1993/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v1993/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v1993/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v1993/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v1993/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v1993/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v1993/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-08-13T08:56:14Z","updated_at":"2017-08-13T08:57:13Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"- cocos2d-x version: git\r\n- devices test on: linux mint 18.2\r\n- developing environments\r\n   -
