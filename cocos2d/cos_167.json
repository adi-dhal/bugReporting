This appears to be because visit() attempts to use _visitingCamera which is not initialised before render() is called on the scene for the first time. This is a problem because you now cannot draw to a rendertexture using visit() when initializing a layer for your scene, before the scene actually starts rendering. This affects win32 but may affect other platforms also. In v3.6 my code did not cause an error when using visit() to draw to a rendertexture before the scene starts.\n\nTo reproduce, add the following to HelloWorld::init() in the standard project created by cocos:\n\n```\nauto testSprite = Sprite::create(\"CloseNormal.png\");\ntestSprite->visit();\n```\n\nIn the debugger you can see the following at CCRenderer.cpp line 1043:\n\n```\nVec2 v2p = Camera::getVisitingCamera()->projectGL(v3p);\n```\n\ngetVisitingCamera returns NULL.\n\nAs a workaround the following can be used to initialise _visitingCamera when the scene is created. Add this after scene->create():\n\n```\nscene->getDefaultCamera()->initDefault();\nscene->getDefaultCamera()->onEnter();\nscene->initCamera();\n```\n\nImplementation of initCamera() in CCScene.cpp:\n\n```\nvoid Scene::initCamera()\n{\n    auto director = Director::getInstance();\n    Camera* defaultCamera = nullptr;\n    const auto& transform = getNodeToParentTransform();\n    if (_cameraOrderDirty)\n    {\n        stable_sort(_cameras.begin(), _cameras.end(), camera_cmp);\n        _cameraOrderDirty = false;\n    }\n\n    for (const auto& camera : _cameras)\n    {\n        if (!camera->isVisible())\n            continue;\n\n        Camera::_visitingCamera = camera;\n        if (Camera::_visitingCamera->getCameraFlag() == CameraFlag::DEFAULT)\n        {\n            defaultCamera = Camera::_visitingCamera;\n        }\n\n        director->pushMatrix(MATRIX_STACK_TYPE::MATRIX_STACK_PROJECTION);\n        director->loadMatrix(MATRIX_STACK_TYPE::MATRIX_STACK_PROJECTION, Camera::_visitingCamera->getViewProjectionMatrix());\n        camera->apply();\n        //clear background with max depth\n        camera->clearBackground(1.0);\n\n        director->popMatrix(MATRIX_STACK_TYPE::MATRIX_STACK_PROJECTION);\n    }\n\n#if CC_USE_3D_PHYSICS && CC_ENABLE_BULLET_INTEGRATION\n    if (_physics3DWorld && _physics3DWorld->isDebugDrawEnabled())\n    {\n        director->pushMatrix(MATRIX_STACK_TYPE::MATRIX_STACK_PROJECTION);\n        director->loadMatrix(MATRIX_STACK_TYPE::MATRIX_STACK_PROJECTION, _physics3dDebugCamera != nullptr ? _physics3dDebugCamera->getViewProjectionMatrix() : defaultCamera->getViewProjectionMatrix());\n        director->popMatrix(MATRIX_STACK_TYPE::MATRIX_STACK_PROJECTION);\n    }\n#endif\n\n    //Camera::_visitingCamera = nullptr;\n    //experimental::FrameBuffer::applyDefaultFBO();\n}\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13322/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13321","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13321/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13321/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13321/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/13321","id":100283075,"number":13321,"title":"V2","user":{"login":"Still4","id":13746605,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13746605?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Still4","html_url":"https://github.com/Still4","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Still4/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Still4/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Still4/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Still4/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Still4/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Still4/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Still4/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Still4/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Still4/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-08-11T10:31:15Z","updated_at":"2015-08-12T05:40:28Z","closed_at":"2015-08-12T05:40:05Z","author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pulls/13321","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/13321","diff_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/13321.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/13321.patch"},"body":"Fixing typos in create_project.py\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13321/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13320","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13320/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13320/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13320/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13320","id":100269232,"number":13320,"title":"VertexAttribValue::setPointer for Lua","user":{"login":"fusijie","id":5085300,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5085300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fusijie","html_url":"https://github.com/fusijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fusijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fusijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fusijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fusijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fusijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fusijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fusijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fusijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fusijie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2015-08-11T09:29:26Z","updated_at":"2016-07-04T05:44:00Z","closed_at":"2016-07-04T05:44:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"`version:` v3.8\n`issue:`\nFor C++, `VertexAttribValue::setPointer` just to make a shallow copy, but we can manage the memory manual.
