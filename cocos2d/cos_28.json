I've downloaded the latest/greatest(?) Android Studio and related sdk, ndk, ant (added to path, etc) When following the steps I had first to complete the prerequisite: http://cocos2d-x.org/docs/installation/Android-terminal/index.html\r\n\r\nProblems started at:  \r\npython android-build.py -p 21 cpp-tests\r\n\r\nThe reason was https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17424\r\n\r\nI've patched the scripts natural-law fixed and tried again only to get the message that the command line build is not supported with Android SDK Tools 25.3.x.\r\n\r\nI guess this obsoletes the all the instruction on:\r\nhttp://cocos2d-x.org/docs/installation/Android-terminal/index.html\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you please fix the documentations? Do we even need command line build for android?\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is related to the above (I guess it is since I could not complete the step): \r\nI then skipped this step opened Android Studio and opened cpp-tests. After some updating, rebuilding, updating again, rebuilding... the project was built without errors, but when I start it (either on device or simulator) I get:\r\n\r\n```\r\n03-15 14:58:39.216 2611-2611/org.cocos2dx.cpp_tests E/AndroidRuntime: FATAL EXCEPTION: main\r\n                                                                      Process: org.cocos2dx.cpp_tests, PID: 2611\r\n                                                                      java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: dalvik.system.PathClassLoader[DexPathList[[zip file \"/data/app/org.cocos2dx.cpp_tests-1/base.apk\", zip file \"/data/app/org.cocos2dx.cpp_tests-1/split_lib_dependencies_apk.apk\", zip file \"/data/app/org.cocos2dx.cpp_tests-1/split_lib_slice_0_apk.apk\", zip file \"/data/app/org.cocos2dx.cpp_tests-1/split_lib_slice_1_apk.apk\", zip file \"/data/app/org.cocos2dx.cpp_tests-1/split_lib_slice_2_apk.apk\", zip file \"/data/app/org.cocos2dx.cpp_tests-1/split_lib_slice_3_apk.apk\", zip file \"/data/app/org.cocos2dx.cpp_tests-1/split_lib_slice_4_apk.apk\", zip file \"/data/app/org.cocos2dx.cpp_tests-1/split_lib_slice_5_apk.apk\", zip file \"/data/app/org.cocos2dx.cpp_tests-1/split_lib_slice_6_apk.apk\", zip file \"/data/app/org.cocos2dx.cpp_tests-1/split_lib_slice_7_apk.apk\", zip file \"/data/app/org.cocos2dx.cpp_tests-1/split_lib_slice_8_apk.apk\", zip file \"/data/app/org.cocos2dx.cpp_tests-1/split_lib_slice_9_apk.apk\"],nativeLibraryDirectories=[/data/app/org.cocos2dx.cpp_tests-1/lib/x86, /system/lib, /vendor/lib]]] couldn't find \"libcpp_tests.so\"\r\n                                                                          at java.lang.Runtime.loadLibrary0(Runtime.java:984)\r\n                                                                          at java.lang.System.loadLibrary(System.java:1530)\r\n                                                                          at org.cocos2dx.lib.Cocos2dxActivity.onLoadNativeLibraries(Cocos2dxActivity.java:248)\r\n                                                                          at org.cocos2dx.lib.Cocos2dxActivity.onCreate(Cocos2dxActivity.java:264)\r\n                                                                          at android.app.Activity.performCreate(Activity.java:6679)\r\n                                                                          at android.app.Instrumentation.callActivityOnCreate(Instrumentation.java:1118)\r\n                                                                          at android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivity(ActivityThread.java:2618)\r\n                                                                          at android.app.ActivityThread.handleLaunchActivity(ActivityThread.java:2726)\r\n                                                                          at android.app.ActivityThread.-wrap12(ActivityThread.java)\r\n                                                                          at android.app.ActivityThread$H.handleMessage(ActivityThread.java:1477)\r\n                                                                          at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:102)\r\n                                                                          at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:154)\r\n                                                                          at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:6119)\r\n                                                                          at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native Method)\r\n                                                                          at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:886)\r\n                                                                          at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:776)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nOne more thing... from the documentation it is not clear from where to get the sdk/ndk. The latest android studio downloads the sdk/ndk automatically from withing Tools/Android/sdkmanager.
