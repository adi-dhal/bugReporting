I ran the `cocos` command only to find that it couldn't find the `.cocos-project.json` file. Typically I have this in the `<Cocos2d-x-path>/frameworks/runtime-src`. After some investigation I saw that the `cocos` script invokes bash with `#!/bin/bash -l` (it runs the script as if it was ran in a new terminal). In my case, this will always change the directory into the home directory. So it attempts to find the file at `~/.cocos-project.json`. Sure enough, after removing the `-l`, it worked.\n\nIs this the intended behavior of this script? Is there a specific reason the `cocos` script needs to be opened as if it was opened in a new terminal? I'm assuming the idea is to prevent path pollution from the environment. I find \"polluting\" the path useful, especially when testing different configurations, or changing environment variables before I run certain scripts which require a certain configuration.\n\nSo, is this a bug? Feature?\n\nThank you!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15523","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15523/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15523/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15523/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15523","id":151383889,"number":15523,"title":"[bug]PageView::pageTurningEvent
