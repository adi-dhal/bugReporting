compiling the AudioEngine class with GCC on Linux, I'm getting the following warnings:\n\n```\ncocos/audio/linux/AudioEngine-linux.cpp: In member function ‘void

`ChannelInfo::id` is size_t, but `audioID` and `AudioEngineImpl::mapChannelInfo::key_type` are int.\n- C-style type casting between void pointer and integer, such as `(void *)id` and `(size_t) data`\n\nSo this PR changes the type of `ChannelInfo::id` to `int` to prevent type mismatch issues. The changeset also fixes these compiler warnings.\n\nThank you for your time and attention.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15685/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15684","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15684/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15684/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15684/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/15684","id":155741506,"number":15684,"title":"Enable

when addImageAsync() is called, a deadlock can occur. This has been observed in the iOS simulator, but occurs only infrequently.\n\nWhat appears to be happening is addImageAsync() is calling _sleepCondition.notify_one() before loadImage() calls _sleepCondition.wait(signal). Because of this, once wait() is called, the thread blocks and is never resumed.\n\nI believe that, in loadImage() the _requestMutex should not be unlocked until wait() is called. Changing the locking code in loadImage() in renderer/CCTextureCache.cpp to the following solves the problem for me:\n\n```\nvoid TextureCache::loadImage()\n{\n    AsyncStruct *asyncStruct = nullptr;\n    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> signal(_requestMutex);\n    while (!_needQuit)\n    {\n        // pop an AsyncStruct from request queue\n        if(_requestQueue.empty())\n        {\n            asyncStruct = nullptr;\n        }else\n        {\n            asyncStruct = _requestQueue.front();\n            _requestQueue.pop_front();\n        }\n\n        if (nullptr == asyncStruct) {\n            _sleepCondition.wait(signal);\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        // load image\n        asyncStruct->loadSuccess = asyncStruct->image.initWithImageFileThreadSafe(asyncStruct->filename);\n\n        // push the asyncStruct to response queue\n        _responseMutex.lock();\n        _responseQueue.push_back(asyncStruct);\n        _responseMutex.unlock();\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nFor reference, this is the original code:\n\n```\nvoid TextureCache::loadImage()\n{\n    AsyncStruct *asyncStruct = nullptr;\n    std::mutex signalMutex;\n    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> signal(signalMutex);\n    while (!_needQuit)\n    {\n        // pop an AsyncStruct from request queue\n        _requestMutex.lock();\n        if(_requestQueue.empty())\n        {\n            asyncStruct = nullptr;\n        }else\n        {\n            asyncStruct = _requestQueue.front();\n            _requestQueue.pop_front();\n        }\n        _requestMutex.unlock();\n\n        if (nullptr == asyncStruct) {\n            _sleepCondition.wait(signal);\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        // load image\n        asyncStruct->loadSuccess = asyncStruct->image.initWithImageFileThreadSafe(asyncStruct->filename);\n\n        // push the asyncStruct to response queue\n        _responseMutex.lock();\n        _responseQueue.push_back(asyncStruct);\n        _responseMutex.unlock();\n    }\n}\n\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15680/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15679","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15679/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15679/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15679/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15679","id":155588670,"number":15679,"title":"Memory leak when setting Texture2D to Sprite","user":{"login":"Seryusjj","id":5973560,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5973560?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seryusjj","html_url":"https://github.com/Seryusjj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seryusjj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seryusjj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seryusjj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seryusjj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seryusjj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seryusjj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seryusjj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seryusjj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Seryusjj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-05-18T20:01:28Z","updated_at":"2016-05-20T01:35:32Z","closed_at":"2016-05-19T02:20:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have the following code:\nTexture2D \\* texture = new Texture2D();  //referece count = 1\ntexture->initWithData(..)\nsprite->setTexture(texture); // reference count = 2\n\nLater on i change the texture\nsprite->setTexture(texture2); //reference count of texture  = 1\nand the first texture is not going to be released, is this correct?

3.10 c++\n\nThe following line sets the opacity of the scrollbarview\n\n```\nlistview->setScrollBarOpacity(255);\n```\n\nbut it doesn't actually take into effect unless you toggle the autohide:\n\n```\nlistview->setScrollBarAutoHideEnabled(false);\n```\n\nwhich calls\n\n```\n //UIScrollViewBar.cpp line 145\nProtectedNode::setOpacity(_opacity);\n```\n\nIt's because the opacity of the ProtectedNode inside the ScrollViewBar is unchanged, because it's not the same as the opacity as ScrollViewBar.\n\nI don't know the solution because I don't yet know why the `setOpacity` call for ScrollView is not doing it already.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15657/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4721","x-ratelimit-reset":"1506844633","x-github-request-id":"D9D2:110A:24BB91E:4124B88:59D09E39","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=90>;
