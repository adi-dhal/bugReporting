reproduce: \n   write a test driver to display 700 Sprite3D objects (for example, you can use cubes that are 1 unit on a side) in a three dimension grid structure, with a PointLight and ambient light enabled. To make it easier to see the FPS inconsistency, set up a simple animation, like a cube that moves a short distance in every frame. (set up an Action).\n\n  set the animation interval to 30 fps:\n    director->setAnimationInterval(1.0 / 30.0f);\n\nOn an Ipod Touch 4, it shows an fps that is obviously incorrect. The actual framerate is actually closer to 4-6 frames per second, but the fps display is showing 40+ fps. \n\nIf you want to reproduce this issue on a faster device, keep double the 700 Sprite3D instances until you get obviously incorrect FPS numbers..\n\nYou'll see that, at a certain point, even though the fps display seems to show a high frames per second, the animation cube is moving like molasses, which indicates that the FPS display must be incorrect.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14025/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14024","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14024/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14024/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/14024/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/14024","id":108473715,"number":14024,"title":"Fix
