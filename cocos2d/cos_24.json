If it's online and player executes some graphic effects - game always crashes. But the game has never crashed after starting these effects if it doesn't have the Internet connection. And executing these graphic effects doesn't create some request to the Internet and doesn't deal with it. \r\nAnd these crashes're produced only on Android 4.4.\r\n\r\nFor preparing textures we use TexturePacker.\r\n\r\nWe tried to fix it by some solutions, but nothing helped:\r\n1. Using older verions of Facebook SDK (because the majority of crashes happenes when player is online and tries to login to Facebook)\r\n2. Disabled hardwareAccelerated \r\n3. Enabled using largeHeap\r\n4. Enabled method Power of 2 for preparing texture atlases in the TexturePacker\r\n5. Created some extra objects, widgets and sprites in the game\r\n6. Compiled special for arm-v7\r\n7. We checked formats of all textures. And nothing doesn't have RGB555\\RGB556. All is RGBA8888\\RGBA4444\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's the problem? How can the Internet connection links with these errors? How can we fix it? \r\nThank you for helping.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17616/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17615","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17615/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17615/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17615/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17615","id":218028302,"number":17615,"title":"No support for GLES 2.0","user":{"login":"th7nder","id":8305170,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8305170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/th7nder","html_url":"https://github.com/th7nder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th7nder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th7nder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th7nder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th7nder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th7nder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th7nder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th7nder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th7nder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th7nder/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-03-29T22:29:18Z","updated_at":"2017-04-10T09:44:02Z","closed_at":"2017-04-10T09:44:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- cocos2d-x version: cocos2d-x-3.15\r\n- devices test on: Huawei P7 Lite, Simulator Android Studio 7.1.1 \r\n- developing environments\r\n   -
