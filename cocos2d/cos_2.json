Use this simple code :\r\n`\r\n__String* tempHighScore = __String::createWithFormat(\"Démarrer\");\r\n\r\n\tm_pBestScoreLabel = Label::createWithTTF(tempHighScore->getCString(), \"fonts/arial.ttf\", 42.0f);\r\n\tm_pBestScoreLabel->setColor(Color3B::WHITE);\r\n\tm_pBestScoreLabel->setPosition(Vec2(\r\n\t\tvisibleSize.width / 2 + origin.x,\r\n\t\tvisibleSize.height / 2 + origin.y + 230));\r\n\tthis->addChild(m_pBestScoreLabel, 10);\r\n`\r\n2. The text does not appear at all. Same problem with the default arial.ttf file and others like Roboto.ttf with accent in the TTF file. Here for french but same problem with spanish \"Repetición\" for example.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18284","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18284/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18284/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18284/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/18284","id":258414056,"number":18284,"title":"[ci
