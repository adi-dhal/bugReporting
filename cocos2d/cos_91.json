same error.\n\nSo where is wrong?\n\n---\n\n引擎: cocos2d-x\n语言: cpp\n版本: 3.10\n工作平台: mac osx\n目标平台: ios 9.3.1\n\n报错：“libpng error: CgBI: unhandled critical chunk”\n\n在下创建了一个新的项目，然后发现不能用png文件创造新的精灵，jpg倒是可以，然而并没有什么卵用。\n项目自带的HelloWorld.png可以使用，但是任何我自己导入的png文件都不行。\n\n我尝试用这个方法\nFileUtils::getInstance()->isFileExist() \n但是它表示文件是存在的\n\nFileUtils::getInstance()->fullPathForFilename()\n也能找到文件路径\n\n在Debug的时候我跟到\ncocos2d/cocos/platform/CCImage.cpp 的第 1042 行就中断了，没有返回任何信息\n上面有图这里就不重发了\n\n另外在6s 5s iPad mini 4上我都有试过 全都GG\n\n所以问题在哪儿呢？\n\n求有关专家解释\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15608/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15607","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15607/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15607/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15607/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/15607","id":153971460,"number":15607,"title":"remove

Instead it crashes, because it did not find any **product-debug.apk**.\n\nThe best way to do it, is to change the command **cocos compile** command to do a **gradlew clean** to delete all old data and after a **gradlew build** (can be combined to **gradlew clean build**) cocos could copy all **product-*-debug.apk** into the bin/debug/android. Same problem is with **-m release**. The **clean** does not delete any cocos2d-libs, if they are compile from source.\n\nPS: The **cocos deploy** should receive a new arg like **-f
