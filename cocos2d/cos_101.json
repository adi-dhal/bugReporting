stumbled upon an inconsistency in the usage of Cocos2d between the HTML5 engine and Cocos2d-x with JS bindings. I'm using Cocos2d-x 3.10.\n\nAfter creating a shader and setting it to a cc.Node, you can update the uniforms it uses using `cc.GLProgram` and its `setUniformLocationWithXXX` functions. This works properly with HTML5, but won't work when the game is run with Cocos2d-x on native platforms (At least iOS/OS X, not tested with other platforms but it's unlikely to work properly). \n\nTo workaround this issue, you have to use `getGLProgramState`, which is provided by JS bindings of Cocos2d-x. I got the idea by looking at [this thread](http://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/t/basic-shader-help/16533/13).\n## Steps to reproduce\n\nI made a **[repository with the source code](https://github.com/4ian/Cocos2d-shaders-test)** of Hello world, plus a shader with a uniform being updated. If you look at [the source code](https://github.com/4ian/Cocos2d-shaders-test/blob/master/src/app.js), you can see that to make it work on all platforms, I had to use this:\n\n``` js\n// 3rd gotcha: shader uniforms should be updated using getGLProgramState with Cocos2d-x.\n        // Calling setUniformLocationWithXXX only works with HTML5.\n        if (this.sprite.getGLProgramState) {\n            this.sprite.getGLProgramState().setUniformFloat(\"u_value\", Math.random());\n        } else {\n            this._shader.setUniformLocationWith1f(this._valueUniform, Math.random());\n        }\n```\n\nThe Readme in the repository should be enough to let you try the game. Let me know if something is unclear!\nI guess that setUniformLocationWith1f should either be updated to work on Cocos2d-x, or at least have a big **warning** added to the documentation. :wink:

JS project with compiled files (jsc) and empty scheduleUpdate function leaks.\nIt leaks about 100K every 15 seconds.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Run Cocos.app. Create new JS project with \"Precompiled Library\".\n2. Open Terminal. change dir to the root of your new project where there are 'src' and 'res' folders.\n3. Compile cocos sources: \"cocos jscompile -s script -d lib/script\".\n4. Compile the projects sources: \"cocos jscompile -s src -d lib/src\"\n5. Open the project from Cocos.app in Xcode.\n6. Exclude \"JS Common\\script\" and \"Resources\\src\" from targets.\n7. Add new group. Add \"script\" and \"src\" from \"lib\" folder to new group. Make sure \"Create folder reference\" is selected. Click Add.\n8. Run the app on your device.\n9. Open Debug navigator and check the Memory during one minute.\n   --> Here the app must not leak. Stop the app.\n10. Open app.js and change HelloWorldScene:\n\n```\nvar HelloWorldScene = cc.Scene.extend({\n    update:function(dt) {},\n    onEnter:function () {\n        this._super();\n        var layer = new HelloWorldLayer();\n        this.addChild(layer);\n        this.scheduleUpdate();\n    }\n});\n```\n1. Run command from step 4 again to recompile changes.\n2. Open Xcode. Run the app. Check the memory.\n   --> Here the app must

demo application leaks about 100Kb every 20 seconds on real device. I thought that it could be because of garbage collector, but I waited during 20 minutes.\n\nHere are my steps:\n1. I used Cocos.app v 3.10. I created new JS project with precompiled libraries.\n2. I added the code to create new sprite, move it, remove from parent and do all in a loop.\n3. When I run the app the memory was 25.1Mb. It grown to 27.2Mb during 6 minutes of testing.\n4. After 20 minutes, the memory was 31Mb.\n\n![screen shot 2016-03-22 at 11 21 00 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6491282/13946003/c47d948e-f022-11e5-977f-b53d6397a29f.png)\n\nHere are my changes (use any .png 64x64):\n\n```\nvar HelloWorldScene = cc.Scene.extend({\n    onEnter:function () {\n        this._super();\n        var layer = new HelloWorldLayer();\n        this.addChild(layer);\n        for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++)\n            this.addsprite(70*i);\n    },\n    addsprite: function(posy) {\n        var sprite = new cc.Sprite(res.Sprite_png);\n        var size = cc.winSize;\n\n        sprite.setPosition(40, posy);\n        sprite.runAction(cc.sequence(\n                cc.moveTo(0.5, cc.p(size.width-40, posy)),\n                cc.callFunc(this.delsprite, this, sprite)\n                ));\n        this.addChild(sprite);\n    },\n    delsprite: function(sprite) {\n        sprite.stopAllActions();\n        var posy = sprite.getPositionY();\n        sprite.removeFromParent(true);\n        this.addsprite(posy);\n    }\n});\n```\n\nBTW. In my other application, I tried use cache and not to create/remove sprite. This did not help. The app still leaked.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/15297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4709","x-ratelimit-reset":"1506844633","x-github-request-id":"ED9E:110B:10F6461:3D81011:59D09E92","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=102>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=611>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=100>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"71decb99f49e2eaafb048f14111a3053\"","status":"200 OK"}}
