our project we have a scene with two cameras: the default one, with 2D nodes (mostly sprites), and a new one we create ourselves to render a 3D scene. Some of the nodes rendered using the default camera begin initially offscreen, and at a later point we scroll them to enter the visible area. However, they're not showing.\n\nAfter debugging for quite a while to rule out possible problems on our client code related to clipping or incorrect positioning, we found evidence pointing to the two cameras as the likely suspect. I started digging a bit deeper and spotted a potential bug on the visiting/drawing logic.\n\nThe method Node::processParentFlags() resets the variables _transformUpdated and    _contentSizeDirty, and that happens as soon as we visit the node with the first of the scene cameras, regardless that the node's camera mask determines that it won't be rendered by that camera. Interestingly, there's a commented check on processParentFlags() that checks if the node will be visited by the current camera and returns early if it won't.\n\n```\nuint32_t Node::processParentFlags(const Mat4& parentTransform, uint32_t parentFlags)\n{\n    if(_usingNormalizedPosition)\n    {\n        CCASSERT(_parent, \"setNormalizedPosition() doesn't work with orphan nodes\");\n        if ((parentFlags & FLAGS_CONTENT_SIZE_DIRTY) || _normalizedPositionDirty)\n        {\n            auto& s = _parent->getContentSize();\n            _position.x = _normalizedPosition.x * s.width;\n            _position.y = _normalizedPosition.y * s.height;\n            _transformUpdated = _transformDirty = _inverseDirty = true;\n            _normalizedPositionDirty = false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    //remove this two line given that isVisitableByVisitingCamera should not affect the calculation of transform given that we are visiting scene\n    //without involving view and projection matrix.\n\n//    if (!isVisitableByVisitingCamera())\n//        return parentFlags;\n\n    uint32_t flags = parentFlags;\n    flags |= (_transformUpdated ? FLAGS_TRANSFORM_DIRTY : 0);\n    flags |= (_contentSizeDirty ? FLAGS_CONTENT_SIZE_DIRTY : 0);\n\n\n    if(flags & FLAGS_DIRTY_MASK)\n        _modelViewTransform = this->transform(parentTransform);\n\n    _transformUpdated = false;\n    _contentSizeDirty = false;\n\n    return flags;\n}\n```\n\nThen let's change to a Sprite's draw() method.  \n\n```\n    if (visitingCamera == defaultCamera) {\n        _insideBounds = ((flags & FLAGS_TRANSFORM_DIRTY)|| visitingCamera->isViewProjectionUpdated()) ? renderer->checkVisibility(transform, _contentSize) : _insideBounds;\n    }\n```\n\nWhen a sprite node beings its \"execution\" offscreen, the variable _insideBounds is correctly set to false. However, because of the issue with the flags being reset by the first camera that visits the node, it never gets to enter the checkVisibility() method again, so it remains false and doesn't get drawn again.\n\nAltering the default camera depth gets those pesky nodes drawn, but then we get other nodes hidden because of the rendering order, so that option doesn't work for us. Another way we might fix the problem on our side could be by defining another camera and render those sprites using it.  Even uncommenting those two lines on processParentFlags seems to fix the issue, but I agree on the reasoning behind it in the comments.\n\nEither way, the behaviour itself feels wrong to me in principle, those two variables on processParentFlags shouldn't be reset until all the cameras have visited them and it's safe to do so. \n\n//-------------------\n\nEngine version: 3.9, but from what I can see the source code hasn't changed much since then on the v3 branch.\n\nSteps to reproduce: \n1: Create a scene with an additional camera. Set the new camera's flag to a non-default value, and leave both its depth and the default camera's to use their default values (-1 and 0 respectively)\n2: Add some sprites to the scene, set their masks to be rendered by either of the cameras, and make sure that at least one of the sprites rendered by the default camera is initially placed off-screen.\n3: Use an action or move the off-screen sprite(s) manually until they enter the scene bounds.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16099","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16099/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16099/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/16099/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/16099","id":165113143,"number":16099,"title":"Bump simulator version number to 3.12","user":{"login":"mogemimi","id":4461792,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4461792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogemimi","html_url":"https://github.com/mogemimi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogemimi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogemimi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogemimi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogemimi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogemimi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogemimi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogemimi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogemimi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogemimi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-07-12T15:43:16Z","updated_at":"2016-07-13T01:32:59Z","closed_at":"2016-07-13T01:32:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pulls/16099","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/16099","diff_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/16099.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/16099.patch"},"body":"Simulator version number does not seem to be updated in v3.12.
