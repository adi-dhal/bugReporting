The same operation takes 3420ms on Android.\r\n\r\nA similar problem was observed on Windows Phone [http://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/t/solved-rendertexture-is-very-slow-on-3-7-versions/28055](http://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/t/solved-rendertexture-is-very-slow-on-3-7-versions/28055), where Yusel described an workaround : deactivation of the group render command in RenderTexture.\r\n\r\nThe group command was introduced in 3.7 - as an implementation of \"Group command\" from [Roadmap of Render Pipeline](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/wiki/Cocos2d_v30_renderer_pipeline_roadmap), which speed up a rendering performance.\r\n\r\nI implemented Yusels workaround - and saw my application needs just 200 ms on Android, exactly as on iOS. I was interesting in finding out, where is the problem and so Yusels workaround was a base for my problem analyses, which discovered the following facts:\r\n1. rendering of \"X\" sprites on RenderTexture will lead to inserting of \"Y\" commands into one render queue assigned to the group - which is a goal of group command. Those \"Y\" commands render all \"X\" objects.\r\n2. the group command itself is added \"X\" times into render queue - which is a problem, it should be added just once\r\n3. result: rendering of RenderTexture writes \"X\"*\"Y\" times into GPU instead of just \"Y\" times\r\n4. iOS has apparently kind of \"smart filter\" over the GPU, which filters/ignores exactly same openGL operations, Android and Windows phone does not have it and therefore the rendering is very slow.\r\n\r\nThis problem might occur in all classes using Group Command for rendering:\r\nCCClippingNode.cpp\r\nCCNodeGrid.cpp\r\nCCRenderTexture.cpp\r\nUILayout.cpp.cpp\r\n(I just searched for \"addCommand(&_groupCommand\")\r\n\r\nDue to fact, that I am using just RenderTexture, I am not sure.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION:\r\nMake sure group render command will be added just one time and not \"X\" times for \"X\" sprites.\r\n\r\nI've implemented a workaround, which is added into this case as a possible solution. I wrote it in general way and therefore I needed a function from Render as well.\r\n\r\nMaybe a better/smarter solution exists...\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nAny application using RenderTexture on a non iOS operational system is lagging. I believe a quick fix should be introduced to avoid bugs with title \"Android performance issue\".","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18321/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18320","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18320/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18320/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18320/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18320","id":260302682,"number":18320,"title":"Scene cameras","user":{"login":"d-bug","id":4577504,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4577504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-bug","html_url":"https://github.com/d-bug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-bug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-bug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-bug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-bug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-bug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-bug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-bug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-bug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-bug/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-09-25T14:43:11Z","updated_at":"2017-09-25T14:43:11Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"- cocos2d-x version: 3.15.1 May.27 2017\r\n- devices test on: Windows 10/64\r\n- developing environments\r\n   - NDK version:\r\n   - Xcode version:\r\n   - VS version: Microsoft VS Community 2017\r\n   - browser type and version:\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nHi!\r\nI am new to Cocos2d and had the same (worst!) problem.

Sizes are changed hierarchically for all nested nodes and PageView switches to first page.  All my others components have inconsistent state after that because they haven't receive EventType::TURNING event.\r\n\r\nI think we should save the current page index of PageView even if its size has been changed.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nSimple test code to reproduce this situation:\r\n\r\n         ```\r\n      // Page view\r\n\t\tauto container = cocos2d::ui::Layout::create();\r\n\t\tcontainer->setContentSize(getContentSize());\r\n\t\tcontainer->setBackGroundColorType(cocos2d::ui::Layout::BackGroundColorType::SOLID);\r\n\t\tcontainer->setBackGroundColor(cocos2d::Color3B::GRAY);\r\n\t\tcontainer->setLayoutComponentEnabled(true);\r\n\t\taddChild(container);\r\n\r\n\t\tauto pageView = cocos2d::ui::PageView::create();\r\n\t\tpageView->setContentSize(getContentSize() * 0.85f);\r\n\t\tpageView->setAnchorPoint(cocos2d::Vec2::ANCHOR_MIDDLE);\r\n\t\tpageView->setPosition(container->getContentSize() * 0.5f);\r\n\t\tpageView->setDirection(cocos2d::ui::PageView::Direction::HORIZONTAL);\r\n\t\tpageView->setIndicatorEnabled(true);\r\n\t\tpageView->setLayoutComponentEnabled(true);\r\n\t\tpageView->addEventListener(\r\n\t\t\t[pageView](Ref*, cocos2d::ui::PageView::EventType eventType)\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\tstd::cout << \"Go to page #\" << pageView->getCurrentPageIndex() << std::endl;\r\n\t\t\t});\r\n\t\tcontainer->addChild(pageView);\r\n\r\n\t\tconstexpr const ssize_t pagesCount = 3;\r\n\t\tfor (int pageIndex = 0; pageIndex < pagesCount; ++pageIndex)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tauto pagePrototype = cocos2d::ui::Layout::create();\r\n\t\t\tpagePrototype->setBackGroundColorType(cocos2d::ui::Layout::BackGroundColorType::SOLID);\r\n\t\t\tpagePrototype->setBackGroundColor(cocos2d::Color3B::RED);\r\n\t\t\tpageView->addPage(pagePrototype);\r\n\r\n\t\t\tauto text = cocos2d::ui::Text::create();\r\n\t\t\ttext->setFontSize(65.0f);\r\n\t\t\ttext->setString(\"Page number \" + std::to_string(pageIndex + 1));\r\n\t\t\ttext->setAnchorPoint(cocos2d::Vec2::ANCHOR_MIDDLE);\r\n\t\t\ttext->setPosition(pagePrototype->getContentSize() * 0.5f);\r\n\t\t\tpagePrototype->addChild(text);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t// Break 1 (this break is turned pageView to first page)\r\n\t\t\tpageView->scrollToPage(2);\r\n\t\t\tscheduleOnce([pageView](float)\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\tauto newSize = pageView->getContentSize();\r\n\t\t\t\t++newSize.width;\r\n\t\t\t\t++newSize.height;\r\n\t\t\t\tpageView->setContentSize(newSize);\r\n\t\t\t}, 5.0f, \"KeyId_1\");\r\n\t\t}\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18314/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18313","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18313/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18313/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18313/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/18313","id":259762835,"number":18313,"title":"Remove
