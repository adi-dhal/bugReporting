NA\r\n\r\nThis issue is to propose a design adjustment to ``EventMouse`` so that it exposes the definition of a mouse button as an ``enum class`` instead of raw ``#define``'s (for the obvious beneficial reasons).  The result of the change is that clients receiving mouse click events will need to handle a ``EventMouse::MouseButton`` type rather than a raw int. The benefit of this is that the type of the mouse button will be immediately obvious, the downside being that existing code will need to be updated to handle the type (this is trivial though e.g. static_cast<int>).\r\n\r\nThis new issue was triggered by discussion on #8414.\r\n\r\nAs an aside; Cocos2dx uses GLFW3 for its input handling and the current defined button values are a copy paste from there to the existing ``#define``'s. From a clients point of view however they shouldn't be exposed to the fact that GLFW is being used, so that if a new input system is used at some point in the future then it can be swapped out without causing unnecessary pain.

Create a ui::Button without an image (ui::Button::create())\r\n2. call setContentSize and set some size\r\n\r\ncontentSize will soon become 0, 0 again. I don't know what exactly causes that. \r\nI moved to Node and this ain't happening anymore. \r\nI suspect there's something in ui::Button code which checks if there's no texture it resest content size to 0. This for example can cause to problem to detect touches and changing anchor points.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17356/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17355","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17355/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17355/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17355/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17355","id":207175900,"number":17355,"title":"能否提供 libsimulator.xcodeproj 下的Protos.proto protobuf原文件，现在没办法用其他版本的protobuf","user":{"login":"bluce","id":1116610,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1116610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluce","html_url":"https://github.com/bluce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluce/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-02-13T10:26:58Z","updated_at":"2017-02-14T08:42:51Z","closed_at":"2017-02-14T08:42:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- cocos2d-x version:3.13.1\r\n- devices test on:\r\n- developing environments\r\n   -

Reproduce:\r\n\r\nPlease look at those following key points:\r\n```CPP\r\nvoid HttpClient::sendImmediate(HttpRequest* request)\r\n{\r\n    if(!request)\r\n    {\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n

't'.\r\n```CPP\r\nvoid Director::restartDirector()\r\n{\r\n    reset();\r\n    // Texture cache need to be reinitialized\r\n    initTextureCache();\r\n    // Reschedule for action manager\r\n

same time, the game has already restarted, and the running thread is out of control.\r\n\r\n```CPP\r\nvoid HttpClient::networkThreadAlone(HttpRequest* request, HttpResponse* response)\r\n{\r\n    char

'restart()'.\r\n\r\n```CPP\r\nMinXmlHttpRequest::~MinXmlHttpRequest()\r\n{\r\n#define SAFE_REMOVE_OBJECT(callback) if (callback != NULL)\\\r\n    {\\\r\n        JS::RemoveObjectRoot(_cx,

Across several Scenes, load and display large textures\r\n2. Over time, the texture cache fills up and eventually the Android app is killed due to low memory\r\n\r\nOur app has several large images (basically full screen textures) we were using across different scenes. We are experiencing crashes on lower end devices that seem directly related to memory usage. An examination of `adb log` just shows the message: `process has died`. There's no signal sent to the debbuger -- no actual crash occurs. The OS just kills the app because of excess memory usage.\r\n\r\nOn the Java side, I added custom callbacks to `onTrimMemory` which make a call through the JNI to Cocos to call `removeUnusedTextures` in the texture cache. Although it seems to help a small amount, the problem is not fixed. The app will still be killed randomly.\r\n\r\nWhat I think would help tremendously would be some kind of limit on how large the texture cache could get. Instead of continually loading textures in, it would only keep textures in the cache up to a memory limit and after that point it would continually release the least-recently-used texture until it was able to load the requested texture.\r\n\r\nI will look into implementing such a feature, but wanted to create the issue in case other people are having a similar problem with their app.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17344","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17344/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17344/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/17344/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/17344","id":206754579,"number":17344,"title":"fix
