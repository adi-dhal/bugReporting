a Read-Write SpinLock, since\r\n* Operations on _fullPathCache don't take too long\r\n* Performance for single-threaded apps won't be affected too much\r\n\r\nI have made a simple test program, and have the following result\r\n\r\n* When thread contention isn't heavy(5 threads reading & writing at the same time), a SpinLock can be 7 times faster than a std::mutex, about 5 times faster than a pthread_rwlock\r\n* When thread contention gets heavy(30 threads reading & writing at the same time), a SpinLock gets a bit slower than pthread_rwlock, but still a little faster than a std::mutex\r\n* If we have more than 30 threads in contention, SpinLock will become slower than a std::mutex at some point\r\n\r\nBut most of the time, there won't be many threads in contention for the FileUtils' _fullPathCache, I guess 99% of the time there will be no contention, and 99% of the 1% when there is contention, there are only 2 threads, so a SpinLock will be ideal.\r\n\r\nI only tested on iOS
