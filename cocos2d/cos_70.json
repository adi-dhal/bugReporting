testing the v3 branch because it include @dumganhar's #15875 audio patch for Android.\n\nHowever with a simple test project I noticed that app crashes when uses `AudioEngine`.\nI had the problem only with **Android 4.4.2** for now (Android 5, 6 seems ok).\n\nThis is my sample project:\n[AudioCrashTest_mirror.zip](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/files/385706/AudioCrashTest_mirror.zip)\nIt is a slight modification of `cpp_empty_test` \n\nFinally this is my crash dump:\n\n```\n********** Crash dump: **********\nBuild fingerprint:
