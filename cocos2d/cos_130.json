The Unicode Standard encodes characters in the range U+0000..U+10FFFF, which amounts to a 21-bit code space. Depending on the encoding form you choose (UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32), each character will then be represented either as a sequence of one to four 8-bit bytes, one or two 16-bit code units, or a single 32-bit code unit.\n\nThe follow code is not corrent:\n\n``` C++\nint * FontFreeType::getHorizontalKerningForTextUTF16(const std::u16string& text, int &outNumLetters) const\n{\n    if (!_fontRef)\n        return nullptr;\n\n    outNumLetters = static_cast<int>(text.length());\n\n    if (!outNumLetters)\n        return nullptr;\n\n    int *sizes = new int[outNumLetters];\n    if (!sizes)\n

FontFreeType::getGlyphBitmap(unsigned short theChar, long &outWidth, long &outHeight, Rect &outRect,int &xAdvance)`.\n\nThe problem is:\n1. number of code points is not length of std::u16string.\n2. can't just get code point via `text[c]`.\n3. getGlyphBitmap should use `uint32_t` for code point (1st arg), as `sizeof(unsigned short) == 2` is at least true under
