Change this:\r\n\r\ncocos/platform/ios/CCES2Renderer-ios.m\r\n```\r\n        if( ! sharegroup )\r\n            context_ = [[EAGLContext alloc] initWithAPI:kEAGLRenderingAPIOpenGLES2];\r\n        else\r\n            context_ = [[EAGLContext alloc] initWithAPI:kEAGLRenderingAPIOpenGLES2 sharegroup:sharegroup];\r\n```\r\nTo:\r\n```\r\n        if ( ! sharegroup ) {\r\n            context_ = [[EAGLContext alloc] initWithAPI:kEAGLRenderingAPIOpenGLES3];\r\n            if (context_ == nil) {\r\n                context_ = [[EAGLContext alloc] initWithAPI:kEAGLRenderingAPIOpenGLES2];\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        else {\r\n            context_ = [[EAGLContext alloc] initWithAPI:kEAGLRenderingAPIOpenGLES3 sharegroup:sharegroup];\r\n            if (context_ == nil) {\r\n                context_ = [[EAGLContext alloc] initWithAPI:kEAGLRenderingAPIOpenGLES2 sharegroup:sharegroup];\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Android also, code change to start using opengl es 3.0 is simply changing this:\r\ncocos/platform/android/java/src/org/cocos2dx/lib/Cocos2dxGLSurfaceView.java\r\n`            this.setEGLContextClientVersion(2);\r\n`\r\nTo:\r\n`            this.setEGLContextClientVersion(3);\r\n`\r\n\r\nBut this (obviously) causes app to crash on devices which don't support 3.0. And I couldn't figure out how to change Cocos2dxGLSurfaceView to fallback to opengl es 2.0 in this case. Android documentation provides some hints for detecting 3.0 support but not for apps using GLSurfaceView, only for apps managing their own EGL context. I hope someone can help with this.\r\nFrom https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/opengl.html#version-check\r\n```\r\nprivate static double glVersion = 3.0;\r\n\r\nprivate static class ContextFactory implements GLSurfaceView.EGLContextFactory {\r\n\r\n  private static int EGL_CONTEXT_CLIENT_VERSION = 0x3098;\r\n\r\n  public EGLContext createContext(\r\n          EGL10 egl, EGLDisplay display, EGLConfig eglConfig) {\r\n\r\n      Log.w(TAG, \"creating OpenGL ES \" + glVersion + \" context\");\r\n      int[] attrib_list = {EGL_CONTEXT_CLIENT_VERSION, (int) glVersion,\r\n              EGL10.EGL_NONE };\r\n      // attempt to create a OpenGL ES 3.0 context\r\n      EGLContext context = egl.eglCreateContext(\r\n              display, eglConfig, EGL10.EGL_NO_CONTEXT, attrib_list);\r\n      return context; // returns null if 3.0 is not supported;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut overall this seems to be a very safe change which will give immediate performance boost to many apps without any code changes, and let them start using new 3.0 features if they want to.\r\n\r\nYou can check Apple's opengl es 3.0 compatibility checklist to make sure it won't effect cocos2dx engine, but I haven't seen anything failing until now:\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/3DDrawing/Conceptual/OpenGLES_ProgrammingGuide/AdoptingOpenGLES3/AdoptingOpenGLES3.html\r\n\r\n90% iOS devices (iPhone5s and newer) and more than 60% Android devices already support opengl es 3.0
