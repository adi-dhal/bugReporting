cocos2d-x version: 3.15.1\r\n\r\nIt's kind of hard to reproduce, but `Node::detachChild()` can lead to crash.\r\n\r\n I had a case, where removing a child with a `PhysicsBody` caused a `sortAllChildren()` of the `_parent`.\r\n\r\nVia \r\n`ComponentContainer::onExit()`, `PhysicsWorld::collisionSeparateCallbackFunc()`, `Node::visit()`...\r\n\r\nA recently changed localZOrder was still dirty. \r\nThis lead to a change of position in `_children`. \r\n`detachChild()` tried to remove the wrong child.\r\nThis resulted in a \"Node still marked as running\" assert failure. -> **crash**.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nAn easy fix for this would be to change the last line in `Node::detachChild()` to\r\n```\r\n _children.eraseObject(child);\r\n```\r\nIt is a bit of a performance trade-off since `removeChild()` already looked for `child` in `_children` to check (is this even necessary??) whether it's valid to detach it, but since it can't be guaranteed 100% that `_children` won't be changed in the meantime, it shouldn't be done this way.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nI think the declaration of `detachChild()` should be changed IMHO. It's potentially dangerous.\r\n\r\n`Node::detachChild()` doesn't need `childIndex` at all. It's not a big change.\r\n `detachChild()` is only used by `Node::removeChild()`.\r\n\r\nI doubt a lot of projects did an `override` for `detachChild()`. So it's not a big deal to break backwards compatibility here.\r\n\r\nWith the declaration of `detachChild()` changed to  \r\n```\r\nvoid Node::detachChild(Node *child, bool doCleanup)\r\n```\r\n `Node::removeChild()` could be changed to:\r\n```\r\nif( _children.contains(child))  this->detachChild( child, cleanup

function is used internally by CardinalSplineTo (and other actions derived therefrom), but it is also useful outside as a friendly library function (as its placement in the header file for CCActionCatmullRom would suggest is its purpose).\r\n\r\nThe current function signature is `Vec2 ccCardinalSplineAt(Vec2 &p0, Vec2 &p1, Vec2 &p2, Vec2 &p3, float tension, float t)`.  The `Vec2` arguments are taken by reference, helpfully to avoid making unnecessary copies (they are _not_ modified inside the function), but because they are not `const` references, it makes the function frustrating to use, because non-`const` 'lvalue references' cannot bind to the result of an expression:\r\n```\r\nVec2 pointA, pointB;\r\nconst Vec2 pointC;\r\n// ...\r\nauto result = ccCardinalSplineAt(\r\n    pointA + pointB, // error: no matching function for call to 'ccCardinalSplineAt'. 1st argument ('const Vec2&') would lose const qualifier\r\n    pointA - pointB, // same error\r\n    pointC, // same error\r\n    pointA.getNormalized(), // same error, etc.\r\n    1.f,\r\n    1);\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne must resort to frustrating things, such as spelling out all the arguments in local variables beforehand, or doing evil things like casting away `const` on `pointC` above.\r\n\r\nThe interface would be much friendlier with a simple addition of `const`. To clarify, this would not break any existing user code*; it would make the function strictly more usable in more places. My proposed new function signature is:\r\n```\r\nVec2 ccCardinalSplineAt(const Vec2 &p0, const Vec2 &p1, const Vec2 &p2, const Vec2 &p3, float tension, float t)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\\* unless they were explicitly referring to the signature as-is, in their own prototype declaration within `namespace cocos2d`, instead of `#include`ing CCActionCatmullRom.h\r\n\r\nI would have submitted this as a pull request, but I'm brand new to the community and wanted to say hi first.
