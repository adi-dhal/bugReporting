The transparent pixels will get added with the background color of the renderTexture despite setting the background's alpha channel to zero with clear(0,0,0,0). Below is the code I used:\r\n\r\n```\r\nauto sprite = Sprite::create(\"original.png\");\r\nauto renderTexture = RenderTexture::create(64, 64, Texture2D::PixelFormat::RGBA8888);\r\nrenderTexture->clear(0,0,0,0);\r\nrenderTexture->begin();\r\nsprite->setAnchorPoint(Vec2(0, 0));\r\nsprite->setPosition(Vec2(0,0));\r\nsprite->visit();\r\nrenderTexture->end();\r\nrenderTexture->saveToFile(\"rendertexture.png\", Image::Format::PNG);\r\n```\r\nSo in the above case because I cleared with rgba(0,0,0,0), my transparent pixels will end up being darker. One would assume that having an alpha of zero shouldn't change the image at all.\r\n\r\nI posted an example image on the forums:\r\n[http://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/t/rendertexture-savetofile-bugged-for-image-alpha-values/38810](url)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18192","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18192/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18192/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18192/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/18192","id":253014632,"number":18192,"title":"Fix bug of returning UNKNOWN event for return type key SEARCH/SEND in EditBox.","user":{"login":"felippeduran","id":6100219,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6100219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felippeduran","html_url":"https://github.com/felippeduran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felippeduran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felippeduran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felippeduran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felippeduran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felippeduran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felippeduran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felippeduran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felippeduran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felippeduran/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-08-25T20:50:54Z","updated_at":"2017-09-19T02:03:39Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pulls/18192","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/18192","diff_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/18192.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/pull/18192.patch"},"body":"If you set and `EditBox` return type to `SEARCH` (Android and iOS) or `SEND` (Android) and click on the corresponding keyboard button, you get `UNKNOWN` event.\r\n\r\nThis pull request fixes this issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18192/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18191","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18191/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18191/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18191/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/18191","id":252650360,"number":18191,"title":"Bind steamworks to lua","user":{"login":"v1993","id":16255906,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/16255906?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/v1993","html_url":"https://github.com/v1993","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v1993/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v1993/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v1993/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v1993/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v1993/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v1993/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v1993/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v1993/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/v1993/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-08-24T16:01:15Z","updated_at":"2017-09-01T17:22:42Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is it possible (and how?) to bind precompiled steamworks libs to lua?
