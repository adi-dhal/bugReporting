I don't know exactly what I shoud do with it so I trying to find the solution with community.\n\nThank

Create a new project with `cocos new rnj -p org.myself.rnj -l cpp -d .`\n2. Go `cd rnj/ && cocos run -p mac`. Everything goes as expected.\n3. Create a new subclass of Scene, and add a pointer member to it. E.g.\n\n```\nclass Verona: public Scene {\nprivate:\n  Sprite* mercutio;\npublic:\n  /* Init the member with anything but nullptr. */\n  Verona(): mercutio((Sprite *)0xdeadbeef) {}; // \n  CREATE_FUNC(Verona);\n}\n```\n1. In `AppDelegate.cpp` instead of `HelloWorld::createScene()`, do `Verona::create()`.\n2. `cocos run -p mac` once again and the game crashes.\n# Cause\n\nThe project that generates cocos2d static lib (`cocos2d_libs.xcodeproj`) contains `CC_ENABLE_BULLET_INTEGRATION=1` preprocessor macro defined. Whereas the main generated project (`rnj.xcodeproj` in the example above) does not. Thus, the version of cocos2d::Scene in the static lib has two more actual members (namely, `_physics3DWorld` and `_physics3dDebugCamera`), that compiler doesn't expect while building the main project. A pointer member declared in a cocos2d::Scene subclass overlaps `_navMesh` pointer and in `Scene::stepPhysicsAndNavigation(...)` conditional statement\n\n```\nif (_navMesh)\n{\n    _navMesh->update(deltaTime);\n}\n```\n\nevaluates to true and calls `update()`, which eventually leads to the crash.\n\nI'm not sure, which of the projects contains correct settings (is the bullet integration supposed to be on or off by default), but it's certain that the settings must match.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12906/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12905","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12905/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12905/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12905/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/12905","id":95891195,"number":12905,"title":"quick 3.3 or 3.5 trans to cocos2d-x 3.7 rc1","user":{"login":"wade0317","id":3960813,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3960813?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wade0317","html_url":"https://github.com/wade0317","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wade0317/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wade0317/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wade0317/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wade0317/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wade0317/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wade0317/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wade0317/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wade0317/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wade0317/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"dualface","id":62318,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/62318?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dualface","html_url":"https://github.com/dualface","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dualface/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dualface/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dualface/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dualface/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dualface/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dualface/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dualface/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dualface/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dualface/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"dualface","id":62318,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/62318?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dualface","html_url":"https://github.com/dualface","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dualface/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dualface/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dualface/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dualface/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dualface/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dualface/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dualface/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dualface/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dualface/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2015-07-19T06:21:03Z","updated_at":"2015-07-22T13:34:13Z","closed_at":"2015-07-22T13:34:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I create a lua HelloWorld project by running \"cocos new MyLuaGame -p com.yourcompany.mygame -l lua -d MyLuaGame\" with the newest cocos2d-x .
