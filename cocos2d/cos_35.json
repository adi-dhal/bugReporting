is an issue with Mac OSX not wanting to create a proper fullscreen GLFW context, I have read elsewhere that there may be some issues with certain width/height combinations on Mac that cause OSX to not create the proper context and create some odd scaling issues. \r\n\r\nThis issue appears mostly, though not always, (for me) when setting the display scaling option within Mac OSX to either \"Larger Text\" (1024 x 640) or \"More Space\" (1920 x 1200) on a Retina display (2800 x 1800)\r\n\r\nInstead of just having a createWithFullScreen initializer with a viewName and optionally the video mode and monitor (which you can't retrieve without first creating a window or initializing GLFW yourself which would cause issues with Cocos2D-X trying to initialize it again) I created a new initializer which automatically tries to create a fullscreen window with the highest possible screen size the current primary display can offer\r\n\r\nIn my AppDelegate.cpp I've had to change the applicationDidFinishLaunching a bit when creating the glview in order to properly support the Retina Display and it's scaling.\r\n\r\n```\r\nif(!glview) {\r\n#if (CC_TARGET_PLATFORM ==

I try to compile libcocos2d for macOS x86_64 with Xcode 8.2.1, I get a warning about implicit conversion loses integer precision, such as the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncocos/base/CCDirector.cpp:482:12: warning: implicit conversion loses integer precision: 'size_type' (aka 'unsigned long') to 'unsigned int' [-Wshorten-64-to-32]\r\n    return _projectionMatrixStackList.size();\r\n    ~~~~~~ ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt least in this case, the type of size/index for ProjectionMatrixStack seems to prefer `size_t` instead of `unsigned int` because the `Director::_projectionMatrixStackList` is constituted of `std::vector` that uses `size_t` as a `size_type`. So this PR replaces `unsigned int` with `size_t` to avoid the implicit conversion warning.
