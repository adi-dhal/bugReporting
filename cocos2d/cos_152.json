great in debug but in release mode it throws:\n\n```\nplugin.FacebookAgent.getInstance is not a function\n```\n\nI've double checked that this is called:\n\n```\n    sc->addRegisterCallback(register_all_pluginx_protocols);\n    sc->addRegisterCallback(register_pluginx_js_extensions);\n    SDEBUG(LEVEL_INFO, \"app\", \"FB JS-support ENABLED\", \"\");\n```\n\nThe log shows the `FB JS-support ENABLED` message.\nAny hint how could I identify the problem? \nI've put several log dump messages inside the `js_register_pluginx_protocols_FacebookAgent` to make sure it is called and it is...\n\nI've tried it with cocos 3.5, 3.7 and 3.8 and all have this same issue.\n\nI know that plugins are not a prio since there is SDKBOX now, but this functionality doesn't work properly on SDKBOX, please support the plugins till the SDKBOX is mature enough.\n\nIt seems that the JS compilation messes this, could it be? Note that I use in 3.5 JS compilation from 3.7.1. which fixes the bug with JS source code included.\nUPDATE: I've tried it with original 3.5 JS compiler and the bug is still there....\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/13767/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4976","x-ratelimit-reset":"1506848236","x-github-request-id":"D4EC:1109:13FF59C:28AB4F9:59D0A0C6","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=153>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=611>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1093228/issues?state=all&page=151>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"d882103a130d6864cd21e243cd800225\"","status":"200 OK"}}
