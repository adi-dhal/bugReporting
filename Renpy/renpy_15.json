But now, those images can only show continuously. I don't want to use \"pause\" statement because every voices has different length, it's too ineffective to figure out all the number and I have a plenty of them.\nIn another engine like BURIKO General Interpreter, I can realize this by writing like this:\nIS_ECG01A_s02\n_DrawBS\nAYUMU_10001\n_PlayVoice\n_WaitToFinishVoice  // This is the key point! Image will wait for the voice to finish.\n_Wait  // This statement in Ren'py is \"pause 1\"\nSo I hope Ren'py can add a statement like this, then I can control the play time easily.\n————————————————————————\nI hope Ren'py can add a configureation which can play a voice when entering the main menu. I know I can set the music in main menu, but I also want to play a voice(like there's a character saying the title of the game) whenever I enter the main menu. It's better if I can set multiple files and Ren'py will play them randomly or one of them by player settings.\n————————————————————————\nAlso, I hope Ren'py can add a statement which can delay audio play. For example, I write script like this:\nplay sound \"vo1/ayumu_10001.ogg\" delay 3\nshow bg2 is_ecg01a_s02\nwith dissolve\n\nThen the image will show immediately but the audio will play after 3sec.

cases.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/822/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/821","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/821/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/821/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/821/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/821","id":127155488,"number":821,"title":"Fulscreen

a delay argument to Drag.snap() doesn't work, with the snap being instantaneous.  The cause of this seems to be the condition for deciding the snap is over: `if at >= (self.target_at - self.at)` , which is going to be true almost all the time.  So I changed it to what it looked like it should have been, `at >= self.target_at` .\n\nThat exposed another problem, which is that snap() doesn't account for the last render time stored in `self.at` being potentially out of date.  E.g., if the drag is moved and then held still without being dropped for 3 seconds, then dropped, any snap called in the drop handlers will see `self.at` as three seconds prior because there have been no calls to render() since the drag stopped moving.\nSo I added another property, `target_at_delay`, that tells the next render (which has an up-to-date `at` passed to it) to calculate the correct `target_at` and start the animation.  snap() already calls redraw(self,0) so that should be immediate.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/818","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/818/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/818/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/818/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/818","id":124704209,"number":818,"title":"Alt text CDD.","user":{"login":"renpytom","id":379804,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/379804?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom","html_url":"https://github.com/renpytom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-01-04T06:27:33Z","updated_at":"2016-01-27T03:24:56Z","closed_at":"2016-01-27T03:24:56Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/818/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}}],"meta":{"x-ratelimit-limit":"5000","x-ratelimit-remaining":"4810","x-ratelimit-reset":"1507317096","x-github-request-id":"DBE9:366E:E6AB9:1FA5BC:59D7D0A2","x-github-media-type":"github.squirrel-girl-preview","link":"<https://api.github.com/repositories/4815490/issues?state=all&page=16>; rel=\"next\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/4815490/issues?state=all&page=43>; rel=\"last\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/4815490/issues?state=all&page=1>; rel=\"first\", <https://api.github.com/repositories/4815490/issues?state=all&page=14>; rel=\"prev\"","etag":"\"5cc4f9bac75b72eb94a57290c53799ec\"","status":"200 OK"}}
