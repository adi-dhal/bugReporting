I like some feed back  before I continue this...\n# NEW VOICE PARAMETERS\n\nUsuage: voice(tag_name, file, **kwargs)\n\nThis extra contains the new implementation of voice support. It can \nbe toggle on and off as a whole, but now has support to toggle off\nand on for individual characters in the Preference Screen. Plus \nonce you set the config.voice_dir you can place the voice files in \nanother folder without haveing to type or retype the path/to/file \nevery time you want voice in the game.\n\nTo use it, place a voice tag_name sndfile line before\neach line of dialogue. Please note that the tag_name is an\noptional argument, but in order to switch off an on voice for\nindividual characters a character name must be place there.\n\n```\n  voice \"e_1002.ogg\"\n  e \"Voice support lets you add spoken word to your games.\"\n```\n\nNormally, a voice is cancelled at the start of the next interaction.\nIf you want a voice to span interactions, call the \nvoice_sustains\n\n```\n  voice \"e_1002.ogg\"\n  e \"Voice sustain is a technique that allows the same voice #        file...\"\n\n  voice sustain\n  e \"...to play through the two lines of dialogue\"\n```\n\nNow to in order to toggle on and off the voice for each individual\ncharacter, you to set the has_voice in the Character() to \ntrue cause by default has_voice is set to false. \n\n```\n   difine e = Character(\"Elieen\", has_voice=True)\n```\n\nWhen has_voice is set to true the Character() name variable \nwill be added to  the _voice.list variable as a string with a \nlist of other Character() that has the has_voice set to \ntrue.\n\n```\n  _voice.list = [(\"Elieen\", \"True\"),(\"Darin\", \"True\")]\n```\n\nNow to make sure that renpy will not re-add these characters to the\n_voice.list variable it will be set as a persistent variable and\nwill be automatically loaded next time the game is started again.\n\nOn the Preference Screen developer would set an \naction button(s) that would utilize the _voice.list variable\nof characters. When you click on the characters name it will darken \nindicating the character's voice is off or normal color indicating\nthe character's voice is on. \n\nAlright to utilize the voice toggle in the game script, the \ndeveloper needs to place the character's name or substitute name from\nin the define argument in to the tag_name from voice.\n\n```\n  voice \"Elieen\" \"e_1002.ogg\"\n  e \"Now since \\\"Elieen\\\" is added to voice...\n   ..My voice can now be toggle on or off by the user.\"\n```\n\nNow and example with the substitute name from define argument.\n\n```\n  voice \"e\" \"e_1002.ogg\"\n  e \"Even though \\\"e\\\" is used instead of \\\"Elieen\\...\n   ...My voice can still be toggle on or off by the user.\"\n```\n\nNow the one last new thing about voice is that if you set the \nconfig.voice_dir in the config.rpy to the directory of the \nvoice files. Once that is set, you wouldn't have to type or retype \nthe path/to/file every time you want voice in the game.\n\n```\n  config.voice_dir = \"Path/To/Voice/Dir\"\n```\n\nPlease not that config.voice_dir default path will be the game \nbase which is when it is set to \"None\" \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/32/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/31","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/31/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/31/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/31/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/31","id":6670347,"number":31,"title":"Android Problem \"assets/common\" Already Exists","user":{"login":"renpytom","id":379804,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/379804?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom","html_url":"https://github.com/renpytom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7963860,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true},{"id":13261695,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/labels/RAPT","name":"RAPT","color":"444444","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2012-09-05T19:15:48Z","updated_at":"2013-06-25T02:19:42Z","closed_at":"2013-06-25T02:19:42Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"http://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewtopic.php?p=222229#p222229\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/31/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/30","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/30/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/30/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/30/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/30","id":6665486,"number":30,"title":"Font Groups","user":{"login":"renpytom","id":379804,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/379804?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom","html_url":"https://github.com/renpytom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renpytom/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7963862,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2012-09-05T16:03:31Z","updated_at":"2012-09-13T03:12:06Z","closed_at":"2012-09-13T03:12:06Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Some games want  to have lines containing text in multiple writings systems.

The problem is that after updating, they lose the variable (I mean is set to zero like in the init).\nI am not 100% sure what is the reason, the code didn't change vs the first game and it worked. So I'm quite sure is something related to this new version.\nMaybe using the autoupdater somehow resets it? I update the config.version everytime I release a new version...\nIf I load an old savegame from Ren'Py 6.13, those values are correctly displayed.
