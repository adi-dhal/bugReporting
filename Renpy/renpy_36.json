http://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=23691&start=30#p296699 , Ren'Py will not start if it has a path like:\n\nc:\\Users\\田中\\desktop\\newgame\\newgame.exe\n\n. As best as I can tell, this only happens if the path can't be represented by the system encoding - so the error would occur with that path if the system encoding is set to English, but not if it's set to Japanese. \n\nThe error seems to be because of http://bugs.python.org/issue2128 , and the issues underlying it - it seems bad enough that Python can't find its standard library.\n\nThis doesn't seem to be a major issue with Ren'Py - it's existed for the life of Ren'Py 6.15, and this is the first time someone has encountered it. At this point, I don't see a workaround that doesn't involve porting to python3.\n\nComments?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/215/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/214","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/214/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/214/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/214/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/214","id":22020902,"number":214,"title":"fix

The user has given us [a screenshot](http://i56.servimg.com/u/f56/18/58/38/21/screen16.jpg) at 1280x800 resolution which displays the same issue.\n\nA couple of members of our development teams are using Macs and cannot reproduce this issue themselves (including myself).\n\nAny ideas? \n\nAnd would this be more appropriate for the forums rather than Github? If so, I apologise.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/194","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/194/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/194/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/194/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/194","id":21522206,"number":194,"title":"default
