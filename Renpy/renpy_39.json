found it quite terrible to have to directly write every name into dialogues. The only solution I found was to define a variable for every char which is simply unnecessary as most characters do have a definition.\n\nI think it would be way easier to simply implement an `ADVCharacter.__str__` method. With this patch you could avoid multiple definitions of a character's name:\n\n```\ndefine c = Character('myChar', color=\"#c0c0c0\")\nc \"Hello there. My name is %(c)s\"\n```\n\nAdditionally my emacs removed all hidden tabs and spaces for example if there were tabs and/or space in empty lines (sorry about that - but by doing this at least the file gets smaller in size, so I just left it this way). The `__str__` method is at line 731.\n\nI'm not quite sure if this would be your way of handling this issue, but if you're fine with a `__str__` method to directly use your classes in dialogues you may accept this small patch. I think it's easier and more convenient to use a syntax like `%(c)s` in order to reduce redundancy.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/119","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/119/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/119/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/119/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/119","id":16717822,"number":119,"title":"stop fastskip in unseen","user":{"login":"kyouryuukunn","id":1556311,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1556311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn","html_url":"https://github.com/kyouryuukunn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2013-07-13T17:57:25Z","updated_at":"2014-07-08T07:41:03Z","closed_at":"2013-07-17T01:20:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/pulls/119","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/119","diff_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/119.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/pull/119.patch"},"body":"I enables the fast skip to also stop in un_seen, if renpy.game.preferences.skip_unseen is False.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/119/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/118","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/118/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/118/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/118/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/118","id":16183955,"number":118,"title":"the screenshot of autosave has the bug.","user":{"login":"kyouryuukunn","id":1556311,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1556311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn","html_url":"https://github.com/kyouryuukunn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyouryuukunn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2013-06-30T05:00:23Z","updated_at":"2013-09-12T11:08:18Z","closed_at":"2013-09-12T11:08:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"v6.15.7374\n\n1 Start \"tutorial\" and start the game.\n2 Open the Menu and the autosave page.\n3.
