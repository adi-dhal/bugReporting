was trying to disable the mouse cursor hiding and could only find the config option which sets the timeout (config.mouse_hide_time). The documentation doesn't say how to stop hiding the cursor, only that it will be hidden. I thought that maybe setting it to 0 would stop it but it actually just hides it all the time (although you can still use the mouse in the game, even though you can't see it). So I spent a while searching for something like <pre>config.mouse_hide = True</pre> ...but couldn't find it.\n\nSo I ended up searching the repository and found this in the launcher <pre>config.mouse_hide_time = 86400 \\* 366</pre> ...which would seem to indicate that there is no way to stop hiding the cursor, you just set it high value a hope you don't reach it.\n\nWould it be possible to add <pre>config.mouse_hide</pre> (defaulting to True) to give an option that makes it a bit more obvious on how to turn it off and isn't dependent on a timer?

unnecessary.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1002","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1002/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1002/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1002/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/1002","id":168548800,"number":1002,"title":"Reloading
