set to False, Item 7 overlaps Item 2 in the vbox. `showif` executes and subsequently hides items 3-6, so they have zero height but are still subject to the `spacing -3` property, causing the buttons to overlap.\n\nBased on the documentation, I would expect the hidden items to either take up no space at all, ignoring the style property and displaying the same as if `if` were used instead of `showif`, or for them to take up the same amount of space as if they were visible, meaning 1, 2, 7, and 8 display in the same location in both instances.\n\nThe latter option seems more intuitive to me, personally (at least in my use case--a replay menu listing numbered scenes the user has previously seen).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1044","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1044/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1044/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/renpy/renpy/issues/1044/events","html_url":"https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/1044","id":180073056,"number":1044,"title":"suppress_overlay
